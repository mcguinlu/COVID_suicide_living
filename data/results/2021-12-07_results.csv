"Impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on ambient air quality: Statistical analyses of available data on urban West Bengal (India)","COVID-19 pandemic and consequent unavoidable lockdown left an unprecedented shock on social and economic life. Present study aimed to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on the ambient air quality of urban areas of eastern Indian state West Bengal. During lockdown period, Air Quality Index (AQI) was mostly found in 'Good' or 'Satisfactory' and sometimes, in 'Moderate' categories, and rarely, in 'poor' category. AQI was in 'Good' category for most of the lockdown span at Siliguri (67%) followed by Kolkata (44%), Howrah (38%) and Asansol (25%). Based on average AQI ranges: lockdown period (48.68- 62.12) &lt; same period before 1 year (75.09-89.81) &lt; Period 3 months before lockdown (175-206), it can be stated that AQI category was better during lockdown compared to the other two at all study areas. In Kolkata overall air pollutant levels except ozone (p&gt;0.05) decreased significantly during lockdown. Similarly, PM2.5, PM10 and NO2 level reduced in Howrah. Beside, no significant changes observed for NH3 and SO2 concentration in Howrah compared to one year before. Apart from PM2.5, NO2, NH3 and SO2 level of previous year, mean concentration of PM10, CO, O-3 showed significant drop at Siliguri during lockdown. Ambient air quality parameters except SO2 showed remarkable decline in Asansol also during lockdown. It can be concluded that COVID-19 lockdown exerted positive effects from environmental health perspective. It improved overall ambient air quality parameters of urban areas of West Bengal. Proper planning and policy making should be given utmost priority to control air pollution in the present 'new normal' COVID-19 scenario.","Majumder, R.","https://doi.org/10.12989/aer.2021.10.2.133","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Advances in Environmental Research-an International Journal; 10(2):133-145, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23227,""

"Mindfulness May Buffer Psychological Distress in Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Differential Role of Mindfulness Facets","The COVID-19 pandemic strongly impacts adolescents' mental health, a population particularly vulnerable to mental disorders, highlighting the need to identify protective factors against COVID-19 related psychological distress to inform policies and intervention strategies. Previous research suggests that mindfulness may be a promising factor that can lower the risk of detrimental psychological consequences related to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it is currently unknown which aspects of mindfulness contribute most to its protective effects. Moreover, previous studies mainly focused on adult samples. The present study aimed to address this gap by investigating the impact of specific mindfulness facets on adolescents' COVID-19 related psychological functioning. 246 Dutch-speaking adolescents were recruited via social media to complete a cross-sectional online survey between June 29 and October 11, 2020. Participants were 16-18 years of age, most of them women (71%), and the majority followed the highest level of Belgian secondary education. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the differential effects of each mindfulness facet on psychological functioning. Our results identified decentering as the facet of mindfulness that was uniquely associated with decreased worry and stress, improved mental health and quality of life, as well as with an increase in social connectedness with others following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unexpectedly, decentering was negatively associated with adolescents' helping behaviour during compared to before the pandemic. Implications for research on and application of mindfulness are discussed. Taken together, these findings suggest that the facet of decentering, among all facets of mindfulness, may represent the main protective factor against psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kock, M.; Kuppens, P.; Van der Gucht, K.; Raes, F.","https://doi.org/10.5334/pb.1093","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Psychologica Belgica; 61(1):356-376, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23229,""

"Impact of Anxiety on Readiness for COVID-19 Vaccination among Polish Nursing Undergraduate Students: Nationwide Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic had a huge impact on the mental health of people around the world, and it increased the level of fear of infection and anxiety about the consequences of the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We examined the relationship between the level of anxiety among nursing students and their knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination. In addition, we explored the correlations among the level of anxiety, knowledge about vaccination, and the willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. A total of 790 undergraduate nursing students participated in the study. The results demonstrated that the level of anxiety among the surveyed nursing students was low;40% of the study participants did not report any anxiety at all, 30% reported mild anxiety, 20% reported moderate anxiety, and 9% reported severe anxiety. At the time of the study, 77.2% of the participants were already vaccinated against COVID-19. Student knowledge about vaccination against COVID-19 was high and anxiety levels were low, with no direct correlation between the knowledge of vaccination and the severity of anxiety.","Gotlib, Joanna, Jaworski, Mariusz, Wawrzuta, Dominik, Sobierajski, Tomasz, Panczyk, Mariusz","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9121385","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(12):1385, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23231,""
"Emotional State and Social Media Experience: A Pandemic Case Study","The world has been experiencing an unprecedented global pandemic since December 2019. Lockdowns, restrictions in daily life, and social distancing characterize the new environment in which the world population finds itself, with minor variations depending on the country of residence. Television, social media, and other sources of information tend to influence and provide information about COVID-19 with varying tones. This study investigated the impact of alerts, news, and information about COVID-19 from social and mass media on the emotional state of the people a year and a half after the start of the pandemic. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 63 participants to assess the relationships between factors such as social media experience, perceived hope, worry, anxiety/depression, attentiveness, trust, health care, health risk, health safety, irritability, mental balance, and emotional state/distress. With the resulting information, a four-factor model was developed to demonstrate the relationships between social media experience, perceived hope, worry, and emotional state/distress. Additionally, a short interview was conducted among the participants in order to collect their opinions and qualitatively analyze them. The developed model demonstrates satisfactory performance characteristics and allows assessment of the delayed influence of incoming information on the people during this unprecedented pandemic.","Bitkina, Olga Vl.; Park, Jaehyun","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132313311","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(23):13311, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23232,""
"Effects of COVID-19 Infection Control Measures on the Festival and Event Sector in Poland and Norway","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on the functioning of the event industry. This article aims to present the impact of infection control measures on the event sector. In addition, the article compares the infection control measures implemented in Poland and Norway. The COVID-19 infection measures analysis is the first stage of a project to build the resilience of the event sector. The study was conducted based on secondary data (analysis of documents and public statistics, with the support of the literature). The research used the descriptive method and comparisons. The results of the study confirmed the following research hypotheses according to which: (1) uncertainty is conducive to overreactions, both of the government and entities from the event sector;(2) mutual trust between government and society reduces the need for restrictions;and (3) the lack of mutual trust between government and society increases uncertainty. Furthermore, the inability to meet people, limited access to culture, and the need to work from home contributed to the deterioration of societies&rsquo;quality of life and mental health. This means that the pandemic has an adverse impact on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3 and 8).","Janiszewska, Dorota, Hannevik Lien, Vilde, Kloskowski, Dariusz, Ossowska, Luiza, Dragin-Jensen, Christian, Strzelecka, Marianna, Kwiatkowski, Grzegorz","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132313265","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(23):13265, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23233,""
"Cannabis Use and Emotional Intelligence in Adolescents during COVID-19 Confinement: A Social Network Analysis Approach","Confinement by COVID-19 had negative consequences on adolescent mental health, including increased cannabis use. Cannabis is related to variables that influence health and well-being. Emotional Intelligence is associated with adaptive coping styles, peer relationships, and social&ndash;emotional competencies. In adolescence, peer selection plays a unique role in the initiation of substance use. However, there are no studies during a confinement stage that analyse the relationships between networks, Emotional Intelligence, and cannabis use. The aim of this paper is to describe and analyse the consumption and friendship networks of an adolescent classroom and their relationship with Emotional Intelligence, cannabis use, and gender during COVID-19 confinement. Participants completed different questionnaires for Emotional Intelligence, cannabis use, and the consumption and friendship network. The sample consisted of 21 students from 10th grade, of which 47.6% were consumers. The friendship network correlates with the consumption network, and significant associations between emotional repair and being a cannabis user. The regression model points to the friendship network as a significant variable in predicting the classroom use network. This study highlights the role of the Social Network Analysis in predicting consumption networks during a COVID-19 confinement stage and serves as a tool for cannabis use prevention interventions in a specific population.","MartÃ­nez-FernÃ¡ndez, MarÃ­a Cristina, GarcÃ­a-RodrÃ­guez, IsaÃ­as, Arias-Ramos, Natalia, GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez, RubÃ©n, TrevissÃ³n-Redondo, Bibiana, LiÃ©bana-Presa, Cristina","https://doi.org/10.3390/su132312954","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Sustainability; 13(23):12954, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23234,""
"COVID-19, Rural Communities, and Implications of Telebehavioral Health Services: Addressing the Benefits and Challenges of Behavioral Health Services via Telehealth in Nebraska","Telehealth has been in use, in various forms, for over a century and is growing increasingly more popular. The current research sought to examine the prevalence, benefits, and challenges of telehealth for behavioral and mental health services in the state of Nebraska with a particular focus on rural communities. The COVID-19 pandemic coincided with the research endeavors and impacted the questions that were asked related to the use of telebehavioral health. Specifically, the research included an investigation of the rates of use of telebehavioral health across agencies and whether/how the pandemic impacted the use of telehealth services. The research included an initial examination of more than 50 behavioral health agencies to assess overall utilization of telehealth. Researchers then conducted interviews with 15 practitioners to discuss the challenges and benefits associated with telehealth services. Key results suggest that implementation of telehealth in Nebraska has resulted in increased access to services among rural residents and has deeply impacted clinical practice. Additionally, clinicians identified specific benefits and challenges of telebehavioral health. It was also noted that the majority of clinicians plan to continue providing services via telehealth if the policies and regulations remain as they are post-COVID-19. Implications of this research highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of using telehealth to increase access.","Freske, Emily, Malczyk, Benjamin Robert","https://doi.org/10.3390/soc11040141","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Societies; 11(4):141, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23235,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Eating Disorders among University Students","An online cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2021 to identify factors, such as changes in food choices, lifestyle, risk and protective behavior, mental health, and social demographics, on eating disorders (ED) among students of a French university. Students were invited to fill out an online questionnaire. ED were identified using the French version of the five-item &ldquo;Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food&rdquo;(SCOFF) questionnaire. The Expali&trade;-validated algorithmic tool, combining SCOFF and body mass index, was used to screen EDs into four diagnostic categories: bulimic ED, hyperphagic ED, restrictive ED and other ED. A total of 3508 students filled the online questionnaire, 67.3% female, mean age 20.7 years (SD = 2.3). The prevalence of ED was 51.6% in women and 31.9% in men (p &lt; 0.0001). Lower food security scores were associated with a higher risk for all ED categories. Depression and academic stress due to COVID-19 were associated with ED regardless of category. Regarding health behaviors, a high adherence to the National nutrition recommendation was a protective factor for the risk of bulimic ED, hyperphagic ED and restrictive ED. A lower frequency of moderate and vigorous physical activity was associated with a higher risk of hyperphagic ED. Our study has shown a high screening of ED among the students of a French university fourteen months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. By disrupting academic learning, jobs and social life, the COVID-19 pandemic could have exacerbated existing ED or contributed to the onset of new ED.","Tavolacci, Marie-Pierre, Ladner, Joel, Dechelotte, Pierre","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13124294","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(12):4294, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23236,""
"Food Insecurity Prevalence, Severity and Determinants in Australian Households during the COVID-19 Pandemic from the Perspective of Women","This study aimed to describe the prevalence, severity and socio-demographic predictors of food insecurity in Australian households during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, from the perspective of women. A cross-sectional online survey of Australian (18&ndash;50 years) women was conducted. The survey collected demographic information and utilised the 18-item US Department of Agriculture Household Food Security Survey Module and the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). A multivariable regression was used to identify predictors of food security status. In this cohort (n = 1005), 19.6% were living in households experiencing food insecurity;with 11.8% experiencing low food-security and 7.8% very low food-security. A further 13.7% of households reported marginal food-security. Poor mental health status (K10 score &ge;20) predicted household food insecurity at all levels. The presence of more than three children in the household was associated with low food-security (OR 6.24, 95% CI: 2.59&ndash;15.03). Those who were renting were 2.10 (95% CI: 1.09&ndash;4.05) times likely to experience very low food-security than those owning their own home. The COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to an increased prevalence of household food insecurity. This study supports the need for a range of responses that address mental health, financial, employment and housing support to food security in Australia.","Kleve, Sue, Bennett, Christie J.; Davidson, Zoe E.; Kellow, Nicole J.; McCaffrey, Tracy A.; Oâ€™Reilly, Sharleen, Enticott, Joanne, Moran, Lisa J.; Harrison, Cheryce L.; Teede, Helena, Lim, Siew","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13124262","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(12):4262, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23237,""
"Behavioral and Mental Responses towards the COVID-19 Pandemic among Chinese Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Study","The novel COVID-19 pandemic spread quickly and continuously influenced global societies. As a vulnerable population that accounted for the highest percentage of deaths from the pandemic, older adults have experienced huge life-altering challenges and increased risks of mental problems during the pandemic. Empirical evidence is needed to develop effective strategies to promote preventive measures and mitigate the adverse psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the behavioral responses (i.e., preventive behaviors, physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption) and mental responses (i.e., depression and loneliness) towards the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese older adults. A further aim was to identify the associations among demographics, behavioral responses, and mental responses. Using a convenience sampling approach, 516 older adults were randomly recruited from five cities of Hubei province in China. Results of the cross-sectional survey showed that 11.7% of participants did not adhere to the WHO recommended preventive measures, while 37.6% and 8.3% of participants decreased physical activity and fruit&ndash;vegetable consumption respectively. For mental responses, 30.8% and 69.2% of participants indicated significantly depressive symptoms and severe loneliness, respectively. Participants&rsquo;behavioral and mental responses differed significantly in several demographics, such as age group, living situation, marital status, education levels, household income, medical conditions, and perceived health status. Demographic correlates and behavioral responses could significantly predicate the mental response with small-to-moderate effect sizes. This is the first study to investigate the characteristics of behavioral and mental responses of Chinese older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Research findings may give new insights into future developments of effective interventions and policies to promote health among older adults in the fight against the pandemic.","Liang, Wei, Duan, Yanping, Yang, Min, Shang, Borui, Hu, Chun, Wang, Yanping, Baker, Julien Steven","https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm14120568","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Risk and Financial Management; 14(12):568, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23238,""

The dual diagnosis screening interview (DDSI), the severity of dependence scale (SDS), and the WHO well-being index were used to evaluate the patients. In the overall sample, DD prevalence was 36.8%, (women: 53.8% vs. men: 32.7%, NS). In both genders the most prevalent DD was depression (33.8%, women: 46.2% vs. men: 30.9%, p = 0.296). Women presented more panic disorders (46.2% vs. 12.7%, p = 0.019) and generalized anxiety (38.5% vs. 10.9%, p = 0,049) than men. When DD was present, women had worse quality of life than men (21,7 vs. 50 points, p = 0.02). During lockdown period 77 patients were attended to and 13 had COVID-19 infection, with no differences in relation to sociodemographic and consumption history variables.

"Exposure to COVID-19 during the First and the Second Wave of the Pandemic and Coronavirus-Related PTSD Risk among University Students from Six Countries&mdash;A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study","This study aimed to reveal differences in exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during the first (W1) and the second (W2) waves of the pandemic in six countries among university students and to show the prevalence and associations between exposure to COVID-19 and coronavirus-related post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) risk during W2. The repeated cross-sectional study was conducted among university students from Germany, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Turkey, and Ukraine (W1: n = 1684;W2: n = 1741). Eight items measured exposure to COVID-19 (regarding COVID-19 symptoms, testing, hospitalizing quarantine, infected relatives, death of relatives, job loss, and worsening economic status due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Coronavirus-related PTSD risk was evaluated by PCL-S. The exposure to COVID-19 symptoms was higher during W2 than W1 among students from all countries, except Germany, where, in contrast, the increase in testing was the strongest. Students from Poland, Turkey, and the total sample were more frequently hospitalized for COVID-19 in W2. In these countries, and Ukraine, students were more often in quarantine. In all countries, participants were more exposed to infected friends/relatives and the loss of a family member due to COVID-19 in W2 than W1. The increase in job loss due to COVID-19 was only noted in Ukraine. Economic status during W2 only worsened in Poland and improved in Russia. This was due to the significant wave of restrictions in Russia and more stringent restrictions in Poland. The prevalence of coronavirus-related PTSD risk at three cutoff scores (25, 44, and 50) was 78.20%, 32.70%, and 23.10%, respectively. The prediction models for different severity of PTSD risk differed. Female gender, a prior diagnosis of depression, a loss of friends/relatives, job loss, and worsening economic status due to the COVID-19 were positively associated with high and very high coronavirus-related PTSD risk, while female gender, a prior PTSD diagnosis, experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, testing for COVID-19, having infected friends/relatives and worsening economic status were associated with moderate risk.","Ochnik, Dominika, Rogowska, Aleksandra M.; Kusnierz, Cezary, Jakubiak, Monika, Wierzbik-Stronska, Magdalena, SchÃ¼tz, Astrid, Held, Marco J.; ArzenÅ¡ek, Ana, Pavlova, Iuliia, Korchagina, Elena V.; Aslan, Imran, Ã‡inar, Orhan","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10235564","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(23):5564, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23241,""
"The Assessment of Fear of COVID-19 among the Elderly Population: A Cross-Sectional Study","The prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically affected the mental health and well-being of individuals. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the perceived fear of COVID-19 among older adults in Poland and identify subpopulations with the highest risk of potential mental health disorders. The study was conducted in November&ndash;December 2020 on 500 people aged &ge;60 years (mean M = 67.9, standard deviation SD = 4.2). In order to collect information on participants&rsquo;characteristics and COVID-19-related information, they were asked to complete a questionnaire based on recorded telephone calls. Perceived fear of COVID-19 was measured using our generated and validated seven-item tool: &ldquo;Scale of fear of COVID-19 infection&rdquo;, which ranged from 7 to 35. Multiple linear regression was performed to identify factors associated with the perceived fear of COVID-19. Our results showed that the highest level of fear of COVID-19 infection was observed among women (p = 0.025) and patients taking anticoagulants (p = 0.004). Moreover, older adults with higher anxiety levels were more likely to be fearful of COVID-19 (according to the GAS-10 scale;p &lt; 0.001). These findings may help policy makers and healthcare workers to adapt and implement better mental health strategies to help the elderly fight fear and anxiety during the prevailing pandemic.","Agrawal, Siddarth, DrÃ³zdz, Mateusz, Makuch, Sebastian, Pietraszek, Alicja, Sobieszczanska, Malgorzata, Mazur, Grzegorz","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10235537","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(23):5537, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23242,""
"Determinants of the Underlying Causes of Mortality during the First Wave of COVID-19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia: A Descriptive National Study","Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, the mortality statistics are constantly changing globally. Mortality statistics analysis has vital implications to implement evidence-based policy recommendations. This study aims to study the demographic characteristics, patterns, determinants, and the main causes of death during the first half of 2020, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Methodology: A retrospective descriptive study targeted all death (29291) registered in 286 private and governmental health settings, from all over KSA. The data was extracted from the ministry of health&rsquo;s death records after the ethical approval. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and WHO grouping, were used to classify the underlying causes of deaths. The collected data were analyzed using the appropriate tables and graphs. Results: 7055 (24.9%) died at the middle age (40&ndash;59 y), and 19212(65.6%) were males, and 18110 (61.8%) were Saudi. The leading causes of deaths were non-communicable diseases (NCDs) 15340 (62.1%), mainly Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) 10103(34. 5%). There was a significant relationship between the main causes of deaths and sex (p&lt; 0.05) and nationality (p = 0.01). Conclusion: NCDs mainly CVDs are the leading cause of death. The Covid-19 mortalities were mainly in males, and old age &gt;55y.

"What about the Consequences of the Use of Distance Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Survey on the Psychological Effects in Both Children and Parents","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic implicated many social restrictions, including the use of distance learning (DL). Indeed, parents were obligated to support their children in online lessons and schoolwork. The aim of this study was to investigate the psycho-emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on parents and children submitted to DL. Methods: One hundred and ninety-two participants (96 parents and 96 children) were enrolled in this study. Parents and children completed an online questionnaire, structured in four sections. Results: The results showed that parents had higher levels of stress and anxiety. In particular, the stress for DL was positively correlated with depression and anxiety. Parents&rsquo;jobs were negatively correlated with their levels of anxiety and stress. On the other hand, children reported higher levels of depressive symptoms and event-related anxiety, which increased as children got older. The stress and the anxiety in parents were positively correlated with the mood depression and anxiety of their children. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the psychological well-being of children and parents who used DL. Although DL could be an alternative teaching method during pandemics, face-to-face teaching is fundamental and irreplaceable as it encourages dialogue, involvement, and human contact.","Maggio, Maria Grazia, Stagnitti, Maria Chiara, Calatozzo, Patrizia, CannavÃ², Antonino, Bruschetta, Daniele, Foti Cuzzola, Marilena, Manuli, Alfredo, Pioggia, Giovanni, CalabrÃ², Rocco Salvatore","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312641","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12641, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23244,""
"Psychosocial and Biological Outcomes of Immersive, Mindfulness-Based Treks in Nature for Groups of Young Adults and Caregivers Affected by Cancer: Results from a Single Arm Program Evaluation from 2016&ndash;2021","The COVID-19 pandemic has left many individuals suffering from &ldquo;connection deficit disorder&rdquo;given changes to the way we work, go to school, socialize, and engage in daily activities. Young adults affected by cancer between the ages of 18&ndash;39 have known this connection deficit long before the pandemic. Being diagnosed and treated for cancer during this time can significantly disrupt engagement in important educational, career, social, and reproductive pursuits, and contribute to increased stress, anxiety, depression, and other negative outcomes. Experiencing meaningful connection&mdash;with nature, with peers who understand, and with oneself, may help assuage this adverse effect of disconnect. A single arm within-subjects program evaluation was conducted to examine outcomes following participation in immersive, multi-night, mindfulness-based treks in nature in a sample of young adults (n = 157) and caregivers (n = 50) affected by cancer from 2016&ndash;2021.

"Mobility in Blue-Green Spaces Does Not Predict COVID-19 Transmission: A Global Analysis","Mobility restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic ostensibly prevented the public from transmitting the disease in public places, but they also hampered outdoor recreation, despite the importance of blue-green spaces (e.g., parks and natural areas) for physical and mental health. We assess whether restrictions on human movement, particularly in blue-green spaces, affected the transmission of COVID-19. Our assessment uses a spatially resolved dataset of COVID-19 case numbers for 848 administrative units across 153 countries during the first year of the pandemic (February 2020 to February 2021). We measure mobility in blue-green spaces with planetary-scale aggregate and anonymized mobility flows derived from mobile phone tracking data. We then use machine learning forecast models and linear mixed-effects models to explore predictors of COVID-19 growth rates. After controlling for a number of environmental factors, we find no evidence that increased visits to blue-green space increase COVID-19 transmission. By contrast, increases in the total mobility and relaxation of other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as containment and closure policies predict greater transmission. Ultraviolet radiation stands out as the strongest environmental mitigant of COVID-19 spread, while temperature, humidity, wind speed, and ambient air pollution have little to no effect. Taken together, our analyses produce little evidence to support public health policies that restrict citizens from outdoor mobility in blue-green spaces, which corroborates experimental studies showing low risk of outdoor COVID-19 transmission. However, we acknowledge and discuss some of the challenges of big data approaches to ecological regression analyses such as this, and outline promising directions and opportunities for future research.","Venter, Zander S.; Sadilek, Adam, Stanton, Charlotte, Barton, David N.; Aunan, Kristin, Chowdhury, Sourangsu, Schneider, Aaron, Iacus, Stefano Maria","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312567","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12567, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23246,""
"Exploring Mental Health during the Initial COVID-19 Lockdown in Mumbai: Serendipity for Some Women","Background: This study explored how low-income women already distressed by reproductive challenges were affected during the initial lockdown conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic in Mumbai, India. Methods: Women with reproductive challenges and living in established slums participated in a longitudinal mixed-methods study comparing their mental health over time, at pre-COVID-19 and at one and four-months into India&rsquo;s COVID-19 lockdown. Results: Participants (n = 98) who presented with elevated mental health symptoms at baseline had significantly reduced symptoms during the initial lockdown. Improvements were associated with income, socioeconomic status, perceived stress, social support, coping strategies, and life satisfaction. Life satisfaction explained 37% of the variance in mental health change, which was qualitatively linked with greater family time (social support) and less worry about necessities, which were subsidized by the government. Conclusions: As the pandemic continues and government support wanes, original mental health issues are likely to resurface and possibly worsen, if unaddressed. Our research points to the health benefits experienced by the poor in India when basic needs are at least partially met with government assistance. Moreover, our findings point to the critical role of social support for women suffering reproductive challenges, who often grieve alone. Future interventions to serve these women should take this into account.","Roberts, Lisa R.; Solomon, Shreeletha, Renati, Solomon J.; Montgomery, Susanne","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312542","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12542, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23247,""
"Morally Distressing Experiences, Moral Injury, and Burnout in Florida Healthcare Providers during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Because healthcare providers may be experiencing moral injury (MI), we inquired about their healthcare morally distressing experiences (HMDEs), MI perpetrated by self (Self MI) or others (Others MI), and burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 265 healthcare providers in North Central Florida (81.9% female, Mage = 37.62) recruited via flyers and emailed brochures that completed online surveys monthly for four months. Logistic regression analyses investigated whether MI was associated with specific HMDEs, risk factors (demographic characteristics, prior mental/medical health adversity, COVID-19 protection concern, health worry, and work impact), protective factors (personal resilience and leadership support), and psychiatric symptomatology (depression, anxiety, and PTSD). Linear regression analyses explored how Self/Others MI, psychiatric symptomatology, and the risk/protective factors related to burnout. We found consistently high rates of MI and burnout, and that both Self and Others MI were associated with specific HMDEs, COVID-19 work impact, COVID-19 protection concern, and leadership support. Others MI was also related to prior adversity, nurse role, COVID-19 health worry, and COVID-19 diagnosis. Predictors of burnout included Self MI, depression symptoms, COVID-19 work impact, and leadership support. Hospital administrators/supervisors should recognize the importance of supporting the HCPs they supervise, particularly those at greatest risk of MI and burnout.","Dale, Lourdes P.; Cuffe, Steven P.; Sambuco, Nicola, Guastello, Andrea D.; Leon, Kalie G.; Nunez, Luciana V.; Bhullar, Amal, Allen, Brandon R.; Mathews, Carol A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182312319","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(23):12319, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23248,""

"Inpatient Mental Healthcare before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Prior studies have demonstrated disruption to outpatient mental health services after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inpatient mental health services have received less attention. The current study utilized an existing cohort of 33 Veterans Health Affairs (VHA) acute inpatient mental health units to examine disruptions to inpatient services. It further explored the association between patient demographic, clinical, and services variables on relapse rates. Inpatient admissions and therapeutic services (group and individual therapy and peer support) were lower amongst the COVID-19 sample than prior to the onset of COVID-19 while lengths of stay were longer. Relapse rates did not differ between cohorts. Patients with prior emergent services use as well as substance abuse or personality disorder diagnoses were at higher risk for relapse. Receiving group therapy while admitted was associated with lower risk of relapse. Inpatient mental health services saw substantial disruptions across the cohort. Inpatient mental health services, including group therapy, may be an important tool to prevent subsequent relapse.","McGuire, Alan B.; Flanagan, Mindy E.; Kukla, Marina, Rollins, Angela L.; Myers, Laura J.; Bass, Emily, Garabrant, Jennifer M.; Salyers, Michelle P.","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9121613","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(12):1613, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23251,""
"Combining International Survey Datasets to Identify Indicators of Stress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Machine Learning Approach to Improve Generalization","The scale and duration of the worldwide SARS-COVID-2 virus-related quarantine measures presented the global scientific community with a unique opportunity to study the accompanying psychological stress. Since March 2020, numerous publications have reported similar findings from diverse international studies on psychological stress, depression, and anxiety, which have increased during this pandemic. However, there remains a gap in interpreting the results from one country to another despite the global rise in mental health problems. The objective of our study was to identify global indicators of pandemic-related stress that traverse geographic and cultural boundaries. We amalgamated data from two independent global surveys across twelve countries and spanning four continents collected during the first wave of the mandated public health measures aimed at mitigating COVID-19. We applied machine learning (ML) modelling to these data, and the results revealed a significant positive correlation between PSS-10 scores and gender, relationship status, and groups. Confinement, fear of contagion, social isolation, financial hardship, etc., may be some reasons reported being the cause of the drastic increase in mental health problems worldwide. The decline of the typical protective factors (e.g., sleep, exercise, meditation) may have amplified existing vulnerabilities/co-morbidities (e.g., psychiatric history, age, gender). Our results further show that ML is an apropos tool to elucidate the underlying predictive factors in large, complex, heterogeneous datasets without invalidating the model assumptions. We believe our model provides clinicians, researchers, and decision-makers with evidence to investigate the moderators and mediators of stress and introduce novel interventions to mitigate the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhao, Eric Yunan, Xia, Daniel, Greenhalgh, Mark, Colicino, Elena, Monaro, Merylin, Hitching, Rita, Harris, Odette A.; Adamson, Maheen M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/covid1040058","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: COVID; 1(4):728-738, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23252,""

Methods: 114 university students aged 19 to 34, whose education model was changed from stationary to hybrid or online due to COVID-19 restrictions, participated in the study. The participants completed the online questionnaire, which consisted of two sections: (1) demographic questions to characterize the subjects and 44 questions based on the literature review. (2) Mini-COPE Inventory. Results: the study showed that the fully online study mode has a negative impact on the mental health of students;hybrid students are more likely to use active and positive coping strategies, which effectively help to control negative thoughts and/or reduce negative mental states.

"Acting Instead of Reacting&mdash;Ensuring Employee Retention during Successful Introduction of i40","The increasing implementation of digital technologies has various positive impacts on companies. However, many companies often rush into such an implementation of technological trends without sufficient preparation and pay insufficient attention to the human factors involved in digitization. This phenomenon can be exacerbated when these technologies become highly dependent, as during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to better understand challenges and to propose solutions for a successful implementation of digitized technology. A literature review is combined with survey results and specific consulting strategies. Data from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany were collected by means of an online survey, with a representative sample of the German population. However, we did not reveal any correlation between home office and suffering, mental health, and physical health (indicators of digitization usage to cope with COVID-19 pandemic), but rather that younger workers are more prone to using digitized technology. Based on previous findings that older individuals tend to have negative attitudes toward digital transformation, appropriate countermeasures are needed to help them become more tech-savvy. Accordingly, a software tool is proposed. The tool can help the management team to manage digitization efficiently. Employee well-being can be increased as companies are made aware of necessary measures such as training for individuals and groups at an early stage.","Eickemeyer, Steffen C.; Busch, Jan, Liu, Chia-Te, Lippke, Sonia","https://doi.org/10.3390/asi4040097","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Applied System Innovation; 4(4):97, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23254,""

"North Thames multi-centre service evaluation: Ethical considerations during COVID-19","ObjectivesDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare resources including staff were diverted from paediatric services to support COVID-positive adult patients. Hospital visiting restrictions and reductions in face-to-face paediatric care were also enforced. We investigated the impact of service changes during the first wave of the pandemic on children and young people (CYP), to inform recommendations for maintaining their care during future pandemics.DesignA multi-centre service evaluation was performed through a survey of consultant paediatricians working within the North Thames Paediatric Network, a group of paediatric services in London. We investigated six areas: redeployment, visiting restrictions, patient safety, vulnerable children, virtual care and ethical issues.ResultsSurvey responses were received from 47 paediatricians across six National Health Service Trusts. Children's right to health was largely believed to be compromised by the prioritisation of adults during the pandemic (81%;n?=?33). Sub-optimal paediatric care due to redeployment (61%;n?=?28) and the impact of visiting restrictions on CYP's mental health (79%;n?=?37) were reported. Decreased hospital attendances of CYP were associated with parental fear of COVID-19 infection-risks (96%;n?=?45) and government ?stay at home? advice (89%;n?=?42). Reductions in face-to-face care were noted to have disadvantaged those with complex needs, disabilities and safeguarding concerns.ConclusionConsultant paediatricians perceived that paediatric care was compromised during the first wave of the pandemic, resulting in harm to children. This harm must be minimised in subsequent pandemics. Recommendations for future practice which were developed from our findings are provided, including maintaining face-to-face care for vulnerable children.","Sunil Kumar, Namithaa, Sipanoun, Pippa, Dittborn, Mariana, Doyle, Mary, Aylett, Sarah","https://doi.org/10.1177/14777509211063590","","Database: sage; Publication details: Clinical Ethics;: 14777509211063590, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23256,""
"Shifting moods on Sina Weibo: The first 12 weeks of COVID-19 in Wuhan","Better understanding of social media uses in crisis situations can help improve disaster management by policy-makers, organizations, businesses, and members of the public. It can also build theoretical understanding of how social life and citizenship incorporate social media usage. This study tracks the evolution of public sentiment in Wuhan, China, during the first 12?weeks after the identification of COVID-19 on the Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo. Data consist of 133,079 original Sina Weibo posts dealing with the novel coronavirus. The relative prevalence of eight different emotion groups is traced longitudinally using the ROST Content Mining System and the Emotion Vocabulary of Dalian University of Technology. The study finds a progression from confusion/fear, to disappointment/frustration, to depressionxiety, then finally to happiness/gratitude. It argues that this progression indexes the changing affective energies of digital medical citizenship, which in turn indicates the context for intervention in future crises.","Zheng, Peng, Adams, Paul C.; Wang, Jiejie","https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448211058850","","Database: sage; Publication details: New Media & Society;: 14614448211058850, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23257,""
"A Scoping Review of the Psychological and Emotional Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children and Young People","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many changes to the lives of children and young people. Our aim is to explore the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children and young people (ages 5?21).MethodsThe Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines was used to report the findings of this rapid review.ResultsChildren and young people are potentially very vulnerable to the emotional impact of traumatic events that disrupt their daily lives. Key areas of concern include: Death Anxiety and Fear of Infection;lack of social interaction and loss of routine.ConclusionsDespite some early and responsive studies, the evidence base for pandemic impact on children and young people is very limited. Such evidence is urgently needed if adequate and responsive services, that can mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic for children and young people can be established.","Jones, K.; Mallon, Sharon, Schnitzler, Katy","https://doi.org/10.1177/10541373211047191","","Database: sage; Publication details: Illness, Crisis & Loss;: 10541373211047191, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23258,""
"Unsolicited Sexts and Unwanted Requests for Sexts: Reflecting on the Online Sexual Harassment of Youth","The purpose of this qualitative study was to obtain youth perspectives on consensual and non-consensual sexting. We began this study on young people?s (12?19) sexting practices in a large urban center. Before the study was put on pause due to COVID-19 physical distancing measures, we conducted 12 focus groups with 62 participants (47 girls, 15 boys). A key finding was that many girls had received unsolicited sexts (e.g., ?dick pics?) or unwanted requests for sexts. Analysis revealed four interconnected themes: (1) unsolicited sexts;(2) unwanted requests for sexts;(3) complexity associated with saying ?no?;and (4) general lack of adult support. Using our findings from before COVID-19, we discuss the potential impact of COVID-19 on teens? sexting experiences and outline the ways in which social workers and other mental health practitioners can support adolescents and their parents in navigating this new context of sexting during and beyond the global pandemic.","Mishna, Faye, Milne, Elizabeth, Cook, Charlene, Slane, Andrea, Ringrose, Jessica","https://doi.org/10.1177/0044118X211058226","","Database: sage; Publication details: Youth & Society;: 0044118X211058226, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23259,""
"COVID-19 Impact on Students in Physical Therapist and Physical Therapist Assistant Education Programs in New York and New Jersey: Key Issues and Recommended Responses","Introduction. In March 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic surged in New York City, higher education had to either halt or immediately convert to fully online education. Physical therapy program directors in New York (NY) State and New Jersey (NJ) immediately recognized a need to understand the new challenges facing students. Purpose. the purpose of this paper was to identify the challenges that students in physical therapist (PT)/physical therapist assistant (PTA) programs in NY and NJ were experiencing and how institutions could respond to those challenges. Subjects. Students enrolled in a PTor PTA program in NY or NJ;N =934 (861 PT and 73 PTA). Methods. An online survey was distributed to PT/PTA programs in NY/NJ. the survey consisted of open-ended and closed-ended questions related to academic, financial, and nonacademic issues, transition to online learning, and how institutions could respond to student challenges. Descriptive statistics and thematic analysis were used. Results. the most important challenges that students identified were quality/quantity of hands-on experiences, lack of contact with classmates, personal physical and mental health/wellness, and affording tuition and fees. Some differences were found across geographical regions and graduating cohorts. Physical therapist and PTA student cohorts had the same top concerns. Five major themes emerged from open-ended questions: communication;safe return to campus for psycho-motor skills;additional academic resources;recognition of students' financial, mental, and physical health concerns;and, financial support. Discussion and Conclusion. Students in physical therapy education in NY and NJ faced similar challenges because of COVID-19 as observed by other universities worldwide. Physical therapy education can be stressful, and these additional challenges made this time extremely difficult. the findings of this survey can be used to develop a crisis management plan for university emergencies that require program modifications.","Hyland, Nannette, Vore, Mary Ellen, Chan, Clarence, Katz, Joanne, Rivers, Lynn, Hewson, Kyle","https://doi.org/10.1097/JTE.0000000000000205","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Journal of Physical Therapy Education (Lippincott Williams & Wilkins); 35(4):279-285, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23260,""

"Online treatment of persistent complex bereavement disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression symptoms in people who lost loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial and a controlled trial","Background Losing a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic is a potentially traumatic loss that may result in symptoms of persistent complex bereavement disorder (PCBD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and depression. To date, grief-specific cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) has mostly been delivered through individual face-to-face formats, while studies have shown that online treatment also yields promising results. Offering treatment online is now more than ever relevant during the pan demic and may offer important benefits compared with face-to-face CBT, such as lower costs and higher accessibility. Our expectation is that grief-specific online CBT is effective in reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptoms. Objective Our aim is to evaluate the short-term and long-term effectiveness of grief-specific online CBT in reducing PCBD, PTSD, and depression symptom-levels for adults who lost a loved one during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method This study consists of two parts. In part 1, a two-armed (unguided online CBT versus waitlist controls) randomized controlled trial will be conducted. In part 2, a two-armed (guided online CBT versus unguided online CBT) controlled trial will be conducted. Symptoms of PCBD, PTSD, and depression will be assessed via telephone interviews at pre-treatment/pre-waiting period, post-treatment/post-waiting period, and six months post-treatment. Potential participants are people who lost a loved one at least three months earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic with clinically relevant levels of PCBD, PTSD, and/or depression. Analysis of covariance and multilevel modelling will be performed. Discussion This is one of the first studies examining the effectiveness of online grief-specific CBT. More research is needed before implementing online grief-specific CBT into clinical practice.","Reitsma, L.; Boelen, P. A.; de Keijser, J.; Lenferink, L. I.

"Housing inequalities and resilience: the lived experience of COVID-19","COVID-19 policy responses have intensified the use of housing as a spatial and material defence against community spread of infection. In so doing, they have focussed attention upon pre-existing inequalities and the effects of socio-economic management of COVID-19. This paper draws upon individual householdsâ€™ accounts to explore these effects on housing inequalities, and then adapts a critical resilience framework from disaster response in order to examine the implications for policymaking. The empirical work centres upon a case study of lived experiences of COVID-19-constrained conditions, based on a longitudinal-style study combining semi-structured interviews with 40 households, photographs and household tours at two datapoints (before/during COVID-19) in Victoria, Australia. The study reveals how these households were impacted across four domains: (1) employment, finances, services, and mobilities;(2) homemaking including comfort and energy bills, food and provisioning, and home-schooling/working from home;(3) relationships, care and privacy, and;(4) social, physical and mental health. The interviews also indicate how households coped and experienced relief payments and other related support policies during COVID-19. Drawing upon literature on disaster response, we highlight the centrality of vulnerability and resilience in recognising household exposure and sensitivity to COVID-19, and capabilities in coping. From this analysis, gaps in COVID-19 housing and welfare policy are exposed and guide a discussion for future housing policy interventions and pandemic planning.

"Impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic on common childhood respiratory viruses - A epidemiological study based on hospital data","Considering common childhood respiratory viruses and SARS-CoV-2 share similar transmission routes, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to prevent SARS-CoV-2 may affect the epidemiology of respiratory viruses. Therefore, our study aimed to observe the epidemiologic characteristics of common childhood respiratory viruses in 2020 (after the pandemic) compared with 2019 (before the pandemic) in Hangzhou, China. The data were compared between 2019 and 2020 based on age and month, respectively. One or more viruses were detected in 3135/21452 (14.61%) specimens in 2019, which was significantly lower in 1110/8202 (13.53%) specimens in 2020. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most commonly detected virus in 2019 and 2020. The positive rate of adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza virus (PIV)1, PIV2, and PIV3 in 2020 was significantly decreased in 2019. In 2020, RSV replaced ADV as the most predominant virus in children aged 1-6 years, and the positive rate of influenza virus A (FluA), influenza virus B (FluB), PIV1, and PIV2 was not correlated to age. FluA, FluB, and PIV2 were not almost detected from February 2020. The positive rates of ADV and PIV1 were uncorrelated to the month in 2020. By strict NPIs, besides controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, incredible progress has been made to reduce the prevalence of common childhood respiratory viruses.","Ye, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2021.104911","20211206","COVID-19; childhood respiratory viruses; non-pharmaceutical interventions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23265,""

"Education is protective against depressive symptoms in the context of COVID-19","This study assessed current education stage (ie, undergraduate, graduate) as protective against depressive symptoms among a low socioeconomic status (SES) student population in a public university, in the context of COVID-19-related stressors. Participants were students at The City University of New York (CUNY) during the Spring 2020. Demographic data, symptom severity, and current educational stage were collected via an online university-wide survey between April 8, 2020 and May 2, 2020. The prevalence of probable depression was lower amongst persons who reported being currently in a more advanced educational stage compared to people currently in a lower educational stage. COVID-19-related stressor exposure was the largest predictor of depressive symptoms, followed by demographics and current education stage. Current education stage is related to depressive symptoms during COVID-19. Pandemic-related educational disruptions and shifts to remote learning may limit educational achievement for low-SES student populations creating further threats to these students' health.","Rudenstine, McNeal, Schulder, Ettman, Hernandez, Gvozdieva, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2021.2002338","20211206","COVID-19; Education; depression; stressors; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23267,""

Three studies included only school teachers, 2 included schools and universities teachers, and 1 only university teachers. Of the 5 studies, all dealt with remote activities and only 1 included teachers who returned to face-to-face classes 1 to 2 weeks ago. The prevalence of anxiety ranged from 10% to 49.4%, and depression from 15.9% to 28.9%, being considerably higher in studies with teachers who worked in schools. The prevalence of stress ranged from 12.6% to 50.6%. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and stress was high among teachers during the pandemic, with great variation between studies.

"Digital Interventions to Reduce Distress Among Health Care Providers at the Frontline: Protocol for a Feasibility Trial","Stress, anxiety, distress, and depression are high among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and they have reported acting in ways that are contrary to their moral values and professional commitments that degrade their integrity. This creates moral distress and injury due to constraints they have encountered, such as limited resources. The purpose of this study is to develop and show the feasibility of digital platforms (a virtual reality (VR) and a mobile platform) to understand the causes and ultimately reduce the moral distress of healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. This project is a proof-of-concept integration of concepts/applications to demonstrate viability over six months and guide future studies to develop these state-of-the-art technologies to help frontline healthcare workers work in complex moral contexts. In addition, the project will develop innovations that can be used for future pandemics and in other contexts prone to producing moral distress and injury. This will be a prospective, single cohort, pre- and post-test study examining the effect of a brief informative video describing moral distress on perceptual, psychological, and physiological indicators of stress and decision-making during the scenario known to potentially elicit moral distress. To accomplish this, we have developed a VR simulation scenario that will be used before and after the digital intervention for monitoring short-term impacts. The simulation involves an ICU setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and participants will be placed in a morally challenging situation. The participants will be engaged in an educational intervention at the individual, team, and organizational levels. During each test, data will be collected for a) physiological measures of stress and after each test, data will be collected regarding b) thoughts, feelings and behaviours during a morally challenging situation, and c) perceptual estimates of psychological stress. We aim to create an effective compound intervention composed of the VR-based simulation educational intervention that is examined through the data collected from mental health questionnaires. In addition, participants will continue to be monitored for moral distress and other psychological stresses for eight weeks through our Digital intervention/intelligence Group mobile (DiiG) platform for a longer-term impact. Finally, a comparison will be conducted using machine learning and biostatistical techniques to analyze the short- and long-term impacts of the VR intervention. Funded in (November, 2020), approved by REB in (March, 2021), the study is ongoing. This project aims to demonstrate the feasibility of using digital platforms to understand the continuum of moral distress that can lead to moral injury. Demonstration of feasibility will lead to future studies to examine the efficacy of digital platforms to reduce moral distress.

"COVID-19 and the spinal cord injury community: Concerns about medical rationing and social isolation","To provide a descriptive account of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the spinal cord injury (SCI) community focused on participants' concerns about medical discrimination and medical rationing, the impact of the pandemic on access to personal care attendants and medical supplies, and the impact of the pandemic on overall and mental health. Research Method/Design: Cross sectional, observational study among community-dwelling adults with SCI. Data were collected online between May 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 (n = 187). The online questionnaire included questions regarding medical discrimination and rationing, the impact of the pandemic on access to care and medical supplies, and the impact of the pandemic on overall and mental health. Individuals with SCI have experienced difficulty accessing medical supplies due to the pandemic, and approximately half of our participants (52%) perceived that discrimination through medical rationing was occurring. Furthermore, compared to the general U.S. population, our sample reported that the pandemic had a greater negative impact on their mental health and access to medical supplies. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted mental health and increased concerns of social isolation as well as access to medical supplies among those with SCI. Rehabilitation psychologists must advocate alongside the disability community to limit health disparities and to conduct outreach, specifically with regard to mental health issues. Future research should focus on the effects of pandemic-related fears and social isolation, as well as resilience in the context of public health care threats.

"Job insecurity and emotional disturbance of Polish employees during pandemic COVID-19","The pandemic, as an event that is new and dangerous to the health and life of the population, has put employees at risk of losing their job and experiencing deteriorating working and employment conditions. In this situation, authors were particularly concerned with the extent to which job insecurity (both quantitative and qualitative) contributed to the deterioration of workers' well-being. The study was carried out on 382 Polish employees in April and May 2020. The following research tools were used: the <i>Job Insecurity in Pandemic Scale</i> by Chirkowska-Smolak and Czumak and the <i>Depression</i>, <i>Anxiety</i>, <i>Stress Scale</i> (DASS-21) by Levibond and Levibond. The quantitative and qualitative job insecurity were significant predictors of depression and stress, but they did not explain anxiety symptoms. The scope of the explained variance of these negative emotional states by concerns related to work and employment was not large (from 11% to 17.6%). The moderating role of perceived employability was confirmed only in the case of the relationship between qualitative job insecurity and depression, as well as quantitative job insecurity and stress. However, the increase in the explained variance was very small. Uncertainty related to the maintenance of employment and concerns about the deterioration of working conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on emotional disturbances of employees, but they only explained some of the variance of depression and stress and did not affect the perceived level of anxiety. The smaller role of economic stress in the emergence of negative emotional states could be associated with the occurrence of much more serious threats to the health and life of the population in this period. The very low level of unemployment in Poland, which remained at a similar level throughout the pandemic despite the catastrophic forecasts of economists, could also have played an important role.

"Hopelessness in New York State Physicians During the First Wave of the COVID-19 Outbreak","In the United States, New York State's health care system experienced unprecedented stress as an early epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aims to assess the level of hopelessness in New York State physicians working on the frontlines during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak. A confidential online survey sent to New York State health care workers by the state health commissioner's office was used to gather demographic and hopelessness data as captured by a brief Hopelessness Scale. Adjusted linear regression models were used to assess the associations of physician age, sex, and number of triage decisions made, with level of hopelessness. In total, 1330 physicians were included, of whom 684 were male (51.4%). Their average age was 52.4 years (SD=12.7), with the majority of respondents aged 50 years and older (55.2%). Almost half of the physician respondents (46.3%) worked directly with COVID-19 patients, and 163 (12.3%) were involved in COVID-19-related triage decisions. On adjusted analysis, physicians aged 40 to 49 years had significantly higher levels of hopelessness compared with those aged 50 years or more (ÃŽÂ¼=0.441, SD=0.152, P=0.004). Those involved in 1 to 5 COVID-19-related triage decisions had a significantly lower mean hopelessness score (ÃŽÂ¼=-0.572, SD=0.208, P=0.006) compared with physicians involved in none of these decisions. Self-reported hopelessness was significantly higher among physicians aged 40 to 49 years and those who had not yet been involved in a life or death triage decision. Further work is needed to identify strategies to support physicians at high risk for adverse mental health outcomes during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Johnson, Wallace, Xu, Chihuri, Hoven, Susser, DiMaggio, Abramson, Andrews, Lang, Ryan, Li","https://doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0000000000000808","20211206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23272,""

"COVID-19 Impact on Resident Mental Health and Well-Being","Columbia University's Papper Symposium, a virtual event held on March 20, 2021, was dedicated to the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article summarizes a lecture by Dr. Roberta Hines, Nicholas M. Greene Professor of Anesthesiology and Department Chair and Chief of Anesthesiology at Yale-New Haven Hospital titled ""The impact of COVID-19 on trainees: lessons learned and unanticipated opportunities,"" in addition draws from experiences at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and a focused review of the literature on the toll of the pandemic on trainee well-being and mental health. Early research has demonstrated that rates of burnout and acute stress were higher among health care providers who cared for COVID-19 patients than those who did not and that COVID-19 frontline health care providers are at high risk for common psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Trainees working on the frontlines may be at particularly high risk for these mental health disorders and are less likely to access resources available to them. Program directors and hospital graduate medical education leaders should be aware of the threats to physiological and psychological safety and take action to prevent further detrimental effects. The rates of burnout and mental health disorders among trainees are expected to rise as a result of the pandemic, making screening programs and increased access to mental health treatment an essential feature of all residency and fellowship programs.","Jaconia, Lynch, Miller, Hines, Pinyavat","https://doi.org/10.1097/ANA.0000000000000806","20211206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23274,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 Infodemic on Depression and Sleep Disorders; Focusing On Uncertainty Reduction Strategies and Level of Interpretation Theory","Along with the pandemic situation, information diffusion about the COVID-19 has attracted public attention through social media. The WHO declared an infodemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on February 15, 2020. Misinformation and disinformation, including overwhelming amounts of information about COVID-19 from social media, could promote adverse psychological effects. The current study uses the psychological distance of construal level to predict peoples' negative psychological symptoms from social media usage. The psychological distance of construal-level theory (CLT) intends to show peoples' psychological proximity about objects and events, applied to the COVID-19 pandemic situation for this study. Also, this study links the uncertainty reduction strategy (URS) and CLT to preventive behaviors of COVID-19 and affective reactions to see their effects on mental health problems. A path model was tested (N=297) with data from an online survey to examine how social media usage behaviors are associated with URS and psychological distance with COVID-19 (CLT), leading to preventive behaviors and affective reactions. Finally, the path model was also examined how preventive behaviors and affective reactions are associated with mental health problems, including anxiety and sleep disorder. After measuring participants' social media usage behavior, it is concluded that an increase in general social media usage led to the higher use of URS and lower construal-level on COVID-19. The URS is associated with preventive behaviors, but CLT doesn't show any association with preventive behaviors while it increases affective reactions. Moreover, increased preventive behavior showed negative associations with symptoms of mental health problems, i.e., depression and sleep disorder. However, the affective reaction tends to be positively associated with depression and sleep disorder. Due to the ""infodemic"" of COVID-19, the psychological perception of the pandemic negatively influenced users' mental health problem. The findings of this study imply that the information from social media usage heightened concerns so that they have lower construal level, which doesn't help them take preventive actions but reinforces the negative emotional reaction and mental health problem. Thus, higher URS is a desirable strategy to be equipped.","Jung, Jung","https://doi.org/10.2196/32552","20211206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23275,""

"Postpandemic Nursing Education: Moving Forward With New Ideas","Since March 2020, the world has faced many new challenges, and both faculty and students have needed to make many adjustments to the typical learning experience. Schools of nursing have reported on many innovative teaching strategies used during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. A reflective method was used to propose ideas related to postpandemic nursing education. Consideration was given to ways in which nursing education can be changed in response to lessons learned from the pandemic experience. Most changes reported relate to the delivery of nursing education. Little has been published about the pandemic experience challenging educators to look more critically at the total academic experience and consider implementing changes that will enhance students' learning; support mental health; strengthen clinical partnerships; and help students internalize an identity as a nurse, scholar, and leader who can deal effectively with change and uncertainty. Nurse educators must think broadly about changes that can be made to achieve these goals. <b>[<i>J Nurs Educ</i>. 2021;60(12):680-685.]</b>.","Valiga","https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20211004-04","20211206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23277,""
"Students, Stress, and the Pandemic: An Occupational Health Perspective for Nursing Education","Nursing students have high risk factors for stress, and the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic underscored weaknesses in mitigating nursing student stress and supporting well-being. Occupational health uses proven frameworks and perspectives for understanding and mitigating health risks, and promoting worker wellness. Nurse educators can draw from this knowledge to implement system-level changes in support of a safe and healthy learning environment. This article describes the use of an occupational health strategy to create healthier educational environments. Applying occupational health concepts to nursing education supports honest appraisal of mental health dangers to students, offers keys to managing student health risks, and provides effective approaches for communicating risks with mitigation tactics. An occupational health and safety perspective creates a lens through which nursing stress resulting from the pandemic can be viewed and managed creatively using a holistic approach to mitigate harm from stress in the nursing educational setting. <b>[<i>J Nurs Educ</i>. 2021;60(12):674-679.]</b>.","Hughes","https://doi.org/10.3928/01484834-20211004-02","20211206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23278,""
"""We have to be uncomfortable and creative"": Reflections on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on overdose prevention, harm reduction &amp; homelessness advocacy in Philadelphia","The COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing service delivery interruptions had serious impacts on people who use drugs (PWUD) and people experiencing homelessness, including instability in the drug supply, decreased access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment and harm reduction supplies, increased substance use and relapse due to stress and isolation, inability to properly isolate and quarantine without stable housing, and risk of COVID-19 spread in congregate living spaces. At the same time, many have noted a potential opportunity for rapid change in health, housing, and drug policy despite previous stagnation-referred to as a ""punctuated equilibrium"" by Baumgartner and Jones-in response to the pandemic. The pandemic forced some important policy interventions in the United States at both national and local levels, including eviction moratoriums and loosening of drug policy related to substance use treatment. However, to what extent some of these changes will be sustained past the current COVID-19 crisis is still unclear, as is how drug and housing related policy shifts have impacted the work of frontline overdose prevention, substance use treatment, and homelessness advocacy workers. In this qualitative study, we used semi-structured interviews to assess how Philadelphia's harm reduction advocates, community organizers, and SUD treatment clinicians have responded to the overdose and homelessness crises during COVID-19, and how they predict the pandemic and ensuing policy changes will impact the future of overdose prevention, harm reduction efforts, and homelessness advocacy. We interviewed 30 eligible participants during July and August 2020. The analysis of these data yielded three themes: 1/""None of it should be new to anybody"": COVID-era issues impacting PWUD and people experiencing homelessness are extensions of existing problems; 2/""An opportunity to actually benefit in some way from this crisis"": Possibility for innovation and improved care for PWUD and people experiencing homelessness; and 3/""Nothing we've tried has worked, so we have to be uncomfortable and creative"": The uncertain path forward. Despite the many barriers that participants faced to promoting the health and well-being of marginalized communities during the pandemic, they also believed that the pandemic presented an important opportunity for positive policy change that has the potential to promote drug user health into the future, including a continuation of loosened federal restrictions on substance use disorder treatment, legalization of safe consumption spaces, safe supply of substances, and progressive, creative housing solutions.","Aronowitz, Engel-Rebitzer, Lowenstein, Meisel, Anderson, South","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmqr.2021.100013","20211206","Community organizing; Harm reduction; Housing insecurity; Substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23279,""
"COVID-19 Lockdown 2020 Changed Patterns of Alcohol and Cannabis Use in Swiss Elite Athletes and Bodybuilders: Results From an Online Survey","<b>Objectives:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, increased patterns of substance use have been reported in the general population. However, whether this also applies to athletes is not yet clear. This study aimed to detect changes in alcohol consumption and cannabis use in elite athletes and bodybuilders during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland. <b>Methods:</b> Between April 25 and May 25, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted among bodybuilders and Swiss elite athletes who were active in Olympic sports and disciplines approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on at least the national level. The collected data included information on alcohol and cannabis use during the last month (lockdown) and in the year before COVID-19 lockdown (pre-lockdown), daily training times, existential fears on a scale from 1 to 100, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depression (PHQ-9), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). <b>Results:</b> <i>N</i> = 275 athletes (elite athletes: <i>n</i> = 193; bodybuilders: <i>n</i> = 82) was included in this study. Both pre-lockdown and during lockdown, more bodybuilders used cannabis (both time points: <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than elite athletes, and more elite athletes drank alcohol (pre-lockdown: <i>p</i> = 0.005, lockdown: <i>p</i> = 0.002) compared to bodybuilders. During lockdown, fewer athletes drank alcohol compared to before, but those who continued drinking did so on more days per week (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001, Eta<sup>2</sup> = 0.13). Elite athletes were more likely to increase their drinking with 17.7 vs. 8.2% in bodybuilders. When compared to pre-lockdown measures, the number of athletes using cannabis did not change during lockdown. Only three of 203 elite athletes reported using cannabis during lockdown; this contrasts with 16 of 85 bodybuilders. In a multivariate regression model, existential fears and a lower ISI score were significant predictors for increased alcohol consumption during the lockdown in the entire sample. In a model based on elite athletes only, male sex and a lower ISI score predicted increased alcohol consumption. In a bodybuilder-based model, predictors of increased alcohol consumption were existential fears and trait anxiety. <b>Conclusion:</b> We suggest identifying athletes who are at risk for increased alcohol and cannabis use; we suggest this to be able to professionally support them during stressful times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Imboden, Claussen, Iff, Quednow, Seifritz, SpÃƒÂ¶rri, Scherr, FrÃƒÂ¶hlich","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.759335","20211206","competitive sport; mental health; sports medicine; sports psychiatry; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23280,""
"Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on increasing the risks of children's addiction to electronic games from a social work perspective","Children are among the social groups most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic because they have found themselves forced to stay at home, far from their schoolmates, their friends, and far from all the activities they used to do before the pandemic. so, it was their only refuge for recreation during their stay in Home is staying in front of the screens of tablets, smartphones, and computers to play electronic games for long hours, and there is no doubt that the sudden shift in the lifestyle of children during the Covid-19 pandemic had serious consequences and risks threatening their stability at all levels. In light of that, the current study aimed to determine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on increasing the social, psychological, behavioral, and health risks of children's addiction to electronic games from a social work perspective. This study falls under the type of descriptive-analytical studies that are based on describing the reality of the problem under study. The study sample included 289 children in the age group 6 -17 years in the first grade to the twelfth grade at school. The researcher designed a questionnaire that reflects the four risks facing children to assess these risks. The results showed is that the value of all impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on the increasing risks of children's addiction to electronic games came to a total weight of (27907), weighted relative weight of (80.47%). This indication is High, indicating that the level of impact is High for the Covid-19 pandemic on the increase in all types of risks of children's addiction to electronic games. It ranked first "" Behavioral Risks "" at 91.15%, It is followed by the ranked second ""Social risks "" at 85.5%, Then came third place "" Psychological Risks"" at 80.91%, and in finally in fourth place "" Health Risks"" at 64.28% , which necessitates the need to take a set of serious measures by educating parents to monitor the content of electronic games that their children play, especially violent games, in addition to, reduce the number of hours the child spends practicing these games, and to encourage parents to form a bridge of communication and constructive dialogue between them and their children, and that parents put controls and restrictions on their children's practice of electronic games to confront abnormal behavioral, psychological and social patterns such as aggression, violence, deception, lying, imitation, vigilance, physical stress, poor eyesight, distance from practicing religious rituals, academic delay, introversion, depression, intolerance, selfishness, sadness, isolation from society, social withdrawal and lack of forming social relationships and lack of communication with others. The researcher took care that the results of the current study are very accurate and representative of the reality of the research problem, in light of the researcher's emphasis on the commitment to observe ethical rules to ensure the confidentiality of data. finally, the current study will greatly benefit researchers interested in the field of childhood and its problems and they will rely on its results and recommendations in how to protect children from the dangers of electronic game addiction in light of the Covid-19 crisis in particular.","Elsayed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08503","20211206","Addiction; Children.

"Impacts of the Covid-19 Pandemic on Life of Higher Education Students: Global Survey Dataset from the First Wave","The Covid-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has completely reshaped the lives of people around the world, including higher education students. Beyond serious health consequences for a proportion of those directly affected by the virus, the pandemic holds important implications for the life and work of higher education students, considerably affecting their physical and mental well-being. To capture how students perceived the first wave of the pandemic's impact, one of the most comprehensive and large-scale online surveys across the world was conducted. Carried out between 5 May 2020 and 15 June 2020, the survey came at a time when most countries were experiencing the arduous lockdown restrictions. The online questionnaire was prepared in seven different languages (English, Italian, North Macedonian, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Turkish) and covered various aspects of higher education students' life, including socio-demographic and academic characteristics, academic life, infrastructure and skills for studying from home, social life, emotional life and life circumstances. Using the convenience sampling method, the online questionnaire was distributed to higher education students aged 18 and over and enrolled in a higher education institution. The final dataset consisted of 31,212 responses from 133 countries and 6 continents. The relationships between selected socio-demographic characteristics and elements of student life were tested by using a chi-squared test. The data may prove useful for researchers studying the pandemic's impacts on various aspects of student life. Policymakers can utilize the data to determine the best solutions as they formulate policy recommendations and strategies to support students during this and any future pandemic.","Aristovnik, KerÃ…Â¾iÃ„Â, RavÃ…Â¡elj, TomaÃ…Â¾eviÃ„Â, Umek","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2021.107659","20211206","Covid-19; academic life; academic work; e-learning; institutions; mental health; social life; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23282,""
"Negative Impacts of COVID-19 Induced Lockdown on Changes in Eating Behavior, Physical Activity, and Mental Health as Modified by Digital Healthy Diet Literacy and eHealth Literacy","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19-induced lockdown has been implemented in many countries, which may cause unfavorable changes in lifestyles and psychological health. People's health literacy, healthy diet, and lifestyles play important roles in mitigating the negative impacts of the pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to examine associations of COVID-19 lockdown with changes in eating behavior, physical activity, and mental health; and the modification effects by digital healthy diet literacy (DDL) and eHealth literacy (eHEALS) on the associations. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted an observational study on 4,348 outpatients from 7th April to 31st May 2020. Data from 11 hospitals in Vietnam included demographic characteristics, DDL, eHEALS, eating behavior, physical activity, and mental health changes. Multiple logistic regression and interaction models were performed to examine associations. <b>Results:</b> Patients under lockdown had a lower likelihood of having ""unchanged or healthier"" eating behavior (odds ratio, OR, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 0.29 to 0.51; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), ""unchanged or more"" physical activity (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.90; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and ""stable or better"" mental health (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67 to 0.89; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), as compared to those after lockdown. In interaction models, as compared to patients after lockdown and with the lowest DDL score, those under lockdown and with a one-score increment of DDL had a higher likelihood of having ""unchanged or healthier"" eating behavior (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.07; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and ""stable or better"" mental health (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Similarly, as compared to patients after lockdown and with the lowest eHEALS score, those under lockdown and with a one-score increment of eHEALS had a higher likelihood of having an ""unchanged or more"" physical activity (OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.05; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The COVID-19 lockdown measure could negatively affect eating behavior, physical activity, and mental health among outpatients. Better DDL and eHEALS were found to mitigate the negative impacts of the lockdown, which may empower outpatients to maintain healthy lifestyles and protect mental health.

"Sleep Quality and Mental Health of Medical Students in Greece During the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background-Aim:</b> Medical students have been greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to their educational program, which comprises theoretical knowledge and also clinical duties, making them vulnerable to viral exposures and possibly affecting their everyday life. The aim of this study was to explore changes in sleep and mental health parameters among medical students in Greece during the second year of the pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional study comprised students of all medical schools in Greece (<i>n</i> = 7), using an anonymous online survey. Participants completed the following questionnaires: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Statistical analysis was conducted with the use of SPSS v.26 (IBM SPSS, Armonk NY, USA). <b>Results:</b> Out of the 562 received responses, 559 met the inclusion criteria. The largest proportion of the respondents came from 4th-year (27.8%) and the majority of the sample were females (69.8%). Only 5.9% of the participants reported having been infected by SARS-COV-2. Most of the respondents experienced insomnia (65.9%, mean AIS score: 7.59 Ã‚Â± 4.24), poor sleep quality (52.4%, mean PSQI score: 6.6 Ã‚Â± 3.25) and increased fatigue (48.5%, mean 35.82 Ã‚Â± 11.74). Moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety (mean 9.04 Ã‚Â± 5.66) and depression (mean 9.36 Ã‚Â± 6.15) were noted. Suicidal ideation was found in 16.7% of the sample, while use of sleeping pills in the previous month was reported by 8.8% (<i>n</i> = 47). Further analysis revealed independent associations between sleep and mental health parameters. Higher AIS score was associated with greater FSS score; higher PSQI scores with higher GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Additionally, female students were found to be significantly more affected than males by the COVID-19 pandemic, displaying higher levels of insomnia, sleep disturbances, anxiety and depression. In addition, those with a history of COVID-19 infection or in close proximity with a positive case reported significantly more significant post-traumatic symptoms in IES-COVID-19 questionnaire. <b>Conclusions:</b> In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, prevalence of sleep and mental health disorders among Greek medical students is significant, highlighting the need for better surveillance of students' wellbeing and subsequent counseling, with special focus on female students and other affected groups.","Eleftheriou, Rokou, Arvaniti, Nena, Steiropoulos","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.775374","20211206","COVID-19; medical students; mental health; pandemic; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23285,""
"Social Networks in Limbo The Experiences of Older Adults During COVID-19 in Ghana","While studies exploring COVID-19 and its global influence have begun, social networks and support among older adults in low-and middle-income countries, such as Ghana have been inadequate despite its enormous relevance. Thus, the study presents the voices of older adults in Jamestown, Accra and their social networks during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ghana. Using a phenomenological approach, data were collected from 15 older adults through in-depth interviews on older adults' social network experiences during COVID-19 pandemic situation. Older adults generally struggled to maintain connections with their family members, friends, neighbors, and the community, especially during the lockdown. They ascribed their limited interaction to COVID-19 preventive measures, such as social distancing and the limitation of face-to-face meetings imposed by the government. Loneliness, stress, and depression are also linked to the breakdown of social networks. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' quality of life. It emerged that the Ghanaian society could reconsider the professional services of gerontologists, social workers, community outreach workers, and philanthropists in mitigating loneliness, stress, and depression among older adults in current and future pandemics.","Asante, Awuviry-Newton, Abekah-Carter","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.772933","20211206","COVID-19; Ghana; lived experiences; loneliness; quality of life; social network","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23286,""
"Home Garden With Eco-Healing Functions Benefiting Mental Health and Biodiversity During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Scoping Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to tremendous impacts on human lives and society, which are not only because of negative effects on people's mental health due to isolation policies and physical distance for mitigating the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but also because the incident post-acute sequelae of the coronavirus will cause mental disorders. A green environment is a health resource, which cannot only benefit human physical and mental health, but also increases biodiversity, contributes to flood mitigation, and cools urban areas. A home garden, as a kind of small green space, can provide ecosystem services with eco-healing functions in reducing mental stress during the isolation period of the COVID-19 pandemic through the garden itself and physical activities in it. Such an eco-healing approach within a mini-therapeutic landscape can also benefit biodiversity by enhancing plant diversity in residence and increasing biodiversity at a large scale. In this article, we propose a conceptual framework describing a home garden as ""ecological medicine"" with healing functions to improve mental health, as well as indirectly enhancing urban biodiversity. A home garden, as a mini-type of green landscape with biodiversity content, allows people to get close with nature so that it can promote comfortable and natural feelings during the pandemic. Furthermore, such an eco-healing home garden approach benefiting urban biodiversity can meet the challenges in maintaining environmental and mental health in post COVID-19 pandemic recovery, as well as preparing unknown next-surge risks with potential isolation regulations.","Zhang, Zhang, Zhai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.740187","20211206","biodiversity; ecosystem services; green environments; nature-based-solution; plants and animals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23287,""
"The Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health and Well-Being of Children and Youth in Nova Scotia: Youth and Parent Perspectives","<b>Objectives:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic led to school closures, cancellations of major events, and loss of in-person social interactions for children and youth. These restrictions undoubtedly impacted the lives of children and youth. This study describes the well-being of children and youth in Nova Scotia during the COVID-19 pandemic and their thoughts and feelings about the return to school, from the perspectives of both youth and parents. <b>Methods:</b> A province-wide survey was conducted in August 2020 with parents of school-age children and youth and youth to measure youth well-being since the pandemic began. <b>Results:</b> Parents of children and youth in grades pre-primary to 12 (<i>n</i> = 699; 53% girls) and youth in grades 3-12 (<i>n</i> = 279; 69% girls) completed the online survey. Perceptions of parents about children's emotions during the pandemic were: bored, safe, lonely, happy, and anxious. Youth reported feeling bored, relaxed, depressed, safe, and worried. Sixty-three percent of youth and 72% of parents reported that they/their child felt they were missing important life events. Parents reported that being with parents, being physically active and being with friends made their child feel positive. Youth reported that being with friends, pets and watching TV made them feel good during this time. Seventy-six percent of parents and 62% of youth reported they/their child were getting more screen time than before the pandemic. With schools closed, participants most frequently shared that they missed friends and social interactions, in-person learning, and extra-curricular activities. Youth and parents expressed worries about COVID-19 outbreaks and related restrictions when schools re-opened to in-person learning. <b>Conclusion:</b> The well-being of children and youth in Nova Scotia was greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related school closures in 2020. It is essential that pandemic recovery plans prioritize the health and well-being of children and youth.","Caldwell, Hancock Friesen, Kirk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fped.2021.725439","20211206","feelings; lockdown; mental health; physical activity; school; screen time; sleep; student","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23288,""
"Changes in Eating Habits and Lifestyles in a Peruvian Population during Social Isolation for the COVID-19 Pandemic","Peru has one of the highest infection and death rates in the world for the COVID-19 pandemic. The government implemented house confinement measures with probable consequences on lifestyle, particularly affecting eating habits, physical activity, sleep quality, and mental health. The aim of this study was to assess the lifestyles, physical activity, and sleep characteristics, as well as changes in eating habits in a Peruvian population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed. We analyzed Peruvian adults based on an online self-administered questionnaire divided into sociodemographic, anthropometrics, COVID-19 diagnosis reported, lifestyle habits, and frequency of consumption of foods. During confinement for COVID-19, 1176 participants were studied. Of these, most reported weight gain (1 to 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°kg) and 35.7% were overweight. The lifestyles habits showed that 54.8% reported doing physical activity and 37.2% sleep less. The Peruvian sample presented a main meal pattern of breakfast (95.7%), lunch (97.5%), and dinner (89.1%). Likewise, eating habits before and during COVID-19 pandemic showed that vegetables (OR:1.56, CI95% 1.21-200), fruit (OR: 1.42, CI95% 1.10-1.81), legumes (OR:1.67, CI95% 1.23-2.28), and eggs (OR: 2.00, CI95% 1.52-2.65) presented significant consumption increase during social isolation, while bakery products (OR: 0.74, CI95% 0.56-0.97), meat, snack, refreshment, and fast food decreased in consumption. Other foods showed no significant differences. This study showed an important frequency of overweight and sleep changes. There was a slight increase in physical activity despite the social isolation measures and an increase in healthy eating habits; nevertheless, the majority reported gaining weight.","Huancahuire-Vega, Newball-Noriega, Rojas-Humpire, Saintila, Rodriguez-VÃƒÂ¡squez, Ruiz-Mamani, Morales-GarcÃƒÂ­a, White","https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/4119620","20211206","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23289,""
"Feasibility and acceptance of a virtual multidisciplinary care programme for patients with type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic","Type 2 diabetes mellitus is one of the major public health concerns. The current lifestyle and advances in technology resulted in the development of a virtual mode of professional healthcare, which is an effective alternative method of management of patients. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of implementation of a virtual comprehensive care programme during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients' acceptance and the changes in self-care behaviours, metabolic parameters and emotional factors. The programme employed in this study included nine health interventions in 1 day. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the mode of interventions, including questionnaires, patient evaluations and a satisfaction survey, was modified to the virtual form in 2020. This study assessed the changes in self-care behaviours, metabolic parameters and emotional factors and compared the data pertaining to patients who received virtual healthcare in 2020 with those who received face-to-face modality of medical care in 2019. During June to November 2020, 130 patients received healthcare by means of the virtual modality. The change in modality of healthcare was feasible and 75% of the patients displayed good acceptance of the same. The evaluation of self-care behaviours included self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) levels, foot care and regular exercise. The duration of exercise decreased from 120 to 0Ã¢â‚¬â€°min/week (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). However, there was no change in metabolic parameters. Regarding the mental health parameters, we observed an increase in the proportion of patients with anxiety (21.5% <i>versus</i> 11.1%), depressive symptoms (10.8% <i>versus</i> 4.3%), diabetes distress (18.5% <i>versus</i> 11.1%) and prescription of psychotropic drugs (32.8% <i>versus</i> 18.2%) (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) in virtual <i>versus</i> face-to-face, respectively.

"Effects of ÃŽÂ²-Blockers on the Sympathetic and Cytokines Storms in Covid-19","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a causative virus in the development of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Respiratory manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection such as acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to hypoxia, oxidative stress, and sympatho-activation and in severe cases leads to sympathetic storm (SS). On the other hand, an exaggerated immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 invasion may lead to uncontrolled release of pro-inflammatory cytokine development of cytokine storm (CS). In Covid-19, there are interactive interactions between CS and SS in the development of multi-organ failure (MOF). Interestingly, cutting the bridge between CS and SS by anti-inflammatory and anti-adrenergic agents may mitigate complications that are induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in severely affected Covid-19 patients. The potential mechanisms of SS in Covid-19 are through different pathways such as hypoxia, which activate the central sympathetic center through carotid bodies chemosensory input and induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, which cross the blood-brain barrier and activation of the sympathetic center. ÃŽÂ²2-receptors signaling pathway play a crucial role in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, macrophage activation, and B-cells for the production of antibodies with inflammation exacerbation. ÃŽÂ²-blockers have anti-inflammatory effects through reduction release of pro-inflammatory cytokines with inhibition of NF-ÃŽÂºB. In conclusion, ÃŽÂ²-blockers interrupt this interaction through inhibition of several mediators of CS and SS with prevention development of neural-cytokine loop in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Evidence from this study triggers an idea for future prospective studies to confirm the potential role of ÃŽÂ²-blockers in the management of Covid-19.","Al-Kuraishy, Al-Gareeb, Mostafa-Hedeab, Kasozi, Zirintunda, Aslam, Allahyani, Welburn, Batiha","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.749291","20211206","Beta blockers; SARS-CoV-2; cytokine storm; pharmacology and Covid; sympathetic storm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23291,""

"Gender Differences in the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Potentially Addictive Behaviors: An Emotion-Mediated Analysis","We study the impact of the spring 2020 lockdown in France on gender-related potentially addictive behaviors and associated negative emotions. We rely on an online survey we administered 1 week after the beginning of the lockdown, with responses collected within 2 weeks after the beginning of the lockdown (<i>N</i> = 1,087). We focus on potential addictions to non-creative activities as food consumption and smartphone usage (female-related), and videogame play (male-related). We find that women were about 1.6 times more likely than men to losing control of their usual diet and about 2.3 times more likely than men to increase smartphone usage, while no significant gender effect is detected as for increased videogame play. This is since the negative emotions driving the increase of female-related non-creative activities (sadness, discouragement, and nervousness) were themselves female-related, while the negative emotions driving the increase of male-related non-creative activities (boredom, emptiness, and stress) were shared by women too. Our study supports the intuition that the same negative emotion induced by COVID-19 side-effects could lead to different potentially addictive behaviors; this difference is explained by the interplay between different gender's sensitivities to such emotion and different gender's preferences for specific non-creative activities.","Attanasi, Maffioletti, Shalukhina, Bel, Cherikh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.703897","20211206","COVID-19; addiction; food; lockdown; negative emotions; non-creative activity; smartphone; videogames","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23294,""
"The Family Talk Programme in Ireland: A Qualitative Analysis of the Experiences of Families With Parental Mental Illness","<b>Background:</b> Parental mental illness is common, costly, can lead to children developing mental disorders and impaired lifetime outcomes, and places a substantial burden on caregiving partners. Family Talk (FT) is a widely implemented, 7-session, whole-family programme, with promising evidence of effectiveness in targeting the intergenerational transmission of mental illness. However, to date, very little qualitative research of family experiences of FT has been undertaken. The objectives of this study were to: (1) investigate the experiences of families attending FT; and (2) explore the key facilitators and barriers to engagement in mainstream mental health settings. <b>Methods:</b> This study was nested within a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Family Talk [<i>N</i> = 86 families (139 parents, 221 children)] implemented in 15 adult, child and primary care mental health sites in Ireland. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 45 participants, including 23 parents with mental illness (PMI), 7 partners and 15 children/young people aged 9 to 18 years. Interview data were transcribed verbatim and analysed using constructivist grounded theory. <b>Results:</b> Over two thirds of families across sites reported substantial benefits from participation in FT, including reduced stigma, giving children and partners a voice, increased service-user confidence, and improved family communication/relationships. Key facilitators identified by families included: programme delivery by a competent, non-judgmental clinician; the whole-family approach; and family readiness to engage. Barriers to engagement included stigma, family crises/relapse, service constraints, impact of COVID-19, and a need for further child, family and follow-up sessions/supports. <b>Conclusion:</b> This study is the first qualitative analysis of family experiences of FT to be conducted within the context of an RCT and national programme to introduce family-focused practise for families with PMI. The findings illustrate that FT is beneficial across cultural/policy contexts, different mental disorders and can be implemented across adult and child mental health settings, including children with existing mental health challenges. Key barriers and facilitators to implementation were identified by families, all of which should help to inform the future implementation of FT, and other similar interventions, both in Ireland and elsewhere.","Mulligan, Furlong, McGarr, O'Connor, McGilloway","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.783189","20211206","COPMI; Family Talk; children; mental disorder; mental health; mental illness; parents; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23295,""

The aim of this study was to investigate longitudinal changes in psychological distress, loneliness, boredom, and resilience over the course of the pandemic and to examine the associations between resilience and extraversion at baseline (summer 2020) and psychological distress, loneliness, and boredom at 5-month-follow-up. <b>Methods:</b> Residents of Tyrol (Ã¢â€°Â¥18a) completed an online survey on psychological distress, loneliness, boredom, resilience, and extraversion by using the Brief-Symptom-Checklist, the Three-Item Loneliness Scale, the Multidimensional State Boredom Scale-Short Form (MSBS-SF), the Resilience Scale, and the Extraversion subscale of the Big Five Inventory. <b>Results:</b> Of the 961 baseline participants, 384 took part in the follow-up survey. The percentage of study participants with striking psychological distress remained the same. Similarly, resilience did not change from baseline to follow-up, whereas the number of those experiencing moderate loneliness increased significantly. In contrast, at follow-up, severe loneliness was detected in significantly less people. Boredom decreased significantly over time. A moderate negative association was detected between baseline resilience and psychological distress, loneliness, and boredom at follow-up, and a weak but still significant negative association between extraversion and these outcomes. <b>Discussion:</b> These findings indicate that a subset of the general population consistently suffers from high levels of psychological distress and point to the protective effects of resilience and extraversion in this context.

"The Effect of Cyberbullying, Abuse, and Screen Time on Non-suicidal Self-Injury Among Adolescents During the Pandemic: A Perspective From the Mediating Role of Stress","Adolescence is often a period of turmoil. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased adolescents' difficulty due to mental health consequences that may affect their developmental milestones. This study constructed and empirically tested a theoretical model of three predictive factors (cyberbullying, abuse, and screen time) and stress as the mediating factor in adolescent non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). Structural equation model (SEM) analysis was applied to investigate stress as a mediating factor in the relationship between adolescent NSSI and cyberbullying, abuse, and screen time. This cross-sectional study used a ""crowdsourcing"" sample collection method to recruit 464 adolescents aged 11-17 years who were administered a questionnaire comprising scales on cyberbullying, abuse, screen time, stress, and NSSI. All scales had construct reliabilities ranging from 0.759 to 0.958. SEM statistical analysis was performed using Lisrel version 8.8 (Scientific Software International, USA) for Windows (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA). The mean (Ã‚Â± SD) age of the cohort was 14.61 Ã‚Â± 1.65 years, and consisted of 66.7% females. Secondary high school was the highest educational background (58%). The study found that cyberbullying and abuse were direct positive predictors (critical <i>t</i>-value for the path &gt; 1.96; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) of adolescent NSSI; however, screen time did not have any direct relationship. Furthermore, stress was a significant full mediating factor of screen time and a partial mediating factor of cyberbullying and abuse in the relationship with adolescent NSSI (critical <i>t</i>-value of the path = 5.27; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Cyberbullying, screen time, and abuse with the mediating effect of stress could explain 48% of the variance in adolescent NSSI (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.48).

"Following the Epidemic Waves: Child and Youth Mental Health Assessments in Ontario Through Multiple Pandemic Waves","Emerging studies across the globe are reporting the impact of COVID-19 and its related virus containment measures, such as school closures and social distancing, on the mental health presentations and service utilization of children and youth during the early stages of lockdowns in their respective countries. However, there remains a need for studies which examine the impact of COVID-19 on children and youth's mental health needs and service utilization across multiple waves of the pandemic. The present study used data from 35,162 interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health (ChYMH) assessments across 53 participating mental health agencies in Ontario, Canada, to assess the mental health presentations and referral trends of children and youth across the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the province. Wave 1 consisted of data from March to June 2020, with Wave 2 consisting of data from September 2020 to January 2021. Data from each wave were compared to each other and to the equivalent period one year prior. While assessment volumes declined during both pandemic waves, during the second wave, child and youth assessments in low-income neighborhoods declined more than those within high-income neighborhoods. There were changes in family stressors noted in both waves. Notably, the proportion of children exposed to domestic violence and recent parental stressors increased in both waves of the pandemic, whereas there were decreases noted in the proportion of parents expressing feelings of distress, anger, or depression and reporting recent family involvement with child protection services. When comparing the two waves, while depressive symptoms and recent self-injurious attempts were more prevalent in the second wave of the pandemic when compared to the first, a decrease was noted in the prevalence of disruptive/aggressive behaviors and risk of injury to others from Wave 1 to Wave 2. These findings highlight the multifaceted impact of multiple pandemic waves on children and youth's mental health needs and underscore the need for future research into factors impacting children and youth's access to mental health agencies during this time.","Stewart, Vasudeva, Van Dyke, Poss","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.730915","20211206","COVID-19; assessment; child and youth; interRAI; mental health; referrals; school closures","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23300,""
"Psychological Impact of Exposure to the COVID-19 Sanitary Crisis on French Healthcare Workers: Risk Factors and Coping Strategies","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 sanitary crisis is associated with emotional difficulties such as depression, anxiety and reactional post-traumatic symptoms among healthcare workers. Indeed, healthcare workers were particularly exposed to COVID-19 sanitary crisis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exposure to COVID-19 sanitary crisis on affective symptoms (anxiety, post-traumatic stress, burnout) among French healthcare workers and the mediating role of cognitive emotion regulation strategies (positive re-evaluation and set in perspective) and coping strategies (active coping, planning, instrumental support, emotional support, emotional expression, positive reappraisal, acceptance, denial, blame, humor, religion, distraction, substance use, behavioral disengagement). <b>Method:</b> This cross-sectional survey-based study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1,010 volunteers (838 women) who consented online to participate, from March 24 to June 28, 2020, in France. Participants filled out online questionnaires and visual analogic scales that evaluate affective symptoms related to the COVID-19 sanitary crisis, namely symptoms of post-traumatic stress, burnout, emotion regulation abilities, and coping abilities. <b>Results:</b> The majority (57.8%) of the participants presented post-traumatic symptoms. Depending on the sub-dimensions evaluated, a proportion of participants reported moderate (25.9-31.2%) to severe (17.2-40.7%) burnout symptoms. We found a significant effect of the level of exposure to COVID-19 on affective symptoms. Being a woman, having a lower job position and having less experience were associated with higher level of affective symptoms. Moreover, coping strategies had a mediating effect on the relation between stress and burnout, supporting the coping reserve model. <b>Conclusion:</b> Post-traumatic and burnout symptoms were highly prevalent among French healthcare workers at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis. Exposure to COVID-19 is a determining factor. We can thus promote both coping training and a good environment to limit the emotional consequences of exposure to COVID-19.","Vancappel, Jansen, Ouhmad, Desmidt, Etain, Bergey, d'Ussel, Krebs, Paquet, RÃƒÂ©veillÃƒÂ¨re, Hingray, El-Hage","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.701127","20211206","COVID-19; burnout; health care workers; mediation; outbreak; post-traumatic; sanitary crisis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23301,""
"Predictive Analysis of Factors Influencing Depression Status of Nurses in the COVID-19 Pandemic Intensive Care Unit","<b>Purpose:</b> Understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression in intensive care unit (ICU) nurses, analyze high-risk factors, and propose appropriate measures to maintain physical and mental health. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 78 nurses in ICU of Beijing Ditan Hospital affiliated with Capital Medical University (Beijing area, COVID-19 patient designated hospital) were investigated with self-rating depression scale (SDS).

"A Web-Based Survey on Factors for Unvaccination and Adverse Reactions of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccines in Chinese Patients with Psoriasis","Vaccination is one of the most important strategy to prevent infections and control epidemics, but it also raises concerns about safety in patients receiving treatments. This study aimed to investigate the rate and factors for unvaccination, as well as adverse reactions and deterioration of disease after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in psoriatic patients. A web-based questionnaire survey on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, adverse reactions, and self-reported change of disease condition after vaccination in patients with psoriasis was conducted. Demographic, clinical, and psychological data were collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used in the estimation of associations. A total of 788 psoriatic patients were investigated, and 68.9% reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Younger age, use of interleukin-17 inhibitors, and symptoms of anxiety were associated with unvaccination. The incidence of overall adverse reactions after vaccination was 30.8%, and no severe adverse reaction was reported. The most common local and systemic adverse reactions were pain at the injection site and fatigue, respectively. Most patients reported no change in psoriasis after vaccination, while 16.6% and 4.4% reported slight and significant deteriorations of the disease, respectively. Nonadherence to treatment, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and perceived stress were associated with self-reported deterioration of psoriasis after vaccination. While a favorable safety profile of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is observed, receiving biologic treatment is factor for unvaccination in patients with psoriasis. Deterioration of psoriasis reported by a small proportion of patients is partially attributable to mental and behavioral factors.","Wang, Lv, Han, Shen, Kuang","https://doi.org/10.2147/JIR.S341429","20211206","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; adverse reaction; psoriasis; safety; unvaccination; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23303,""
"Social Stigma of COVID-19 Experienced by Frontline Healthcare Workers of Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care of a Tertiary Healthcare Institution in Delhi","Social stigma is associated with Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) particularly against people who have contracted the disease or have come in contact with it. There is paucity of studies regarding the prevalence of social stigma against healthcare workers (HCWs) in COVID-19 hospitals in India. The objective of this study was to measure social stigma faced by frontline HCWs of Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care in a COVID-19 hospital and to assess the relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and social stigma. A cross-sectional study using a questionnaire (sociodemographic characteristics along with modified Berger HIV Stigma Scale) was conducted from October 10, 2020 to October 30, 2020, in the Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care. The survey was distributed among frontline HCWs using Google Forms as well as Bilingual Physical Form. Total stigma and subgroups of stigma scale were measured for different sociodemographic parameters and compared. Data were presented as mean Ã‚Â± standard deviation. <i>p</i>-value &lt;0.05 was taken as significant. Out of 120 frontline HCWs participated in the study, 68 (56.6%) reported severe level of COVID-19-related stigma. The mean score of COVID-19-related stigma was 41 + 7.69. Mean scores for subgroups of stigma scale, i.e., personalized stigma, disclosure concerns, negative self-image, and concerns with public attitude, were 15.60 + 4.01, 6.68 + 3.21, 5.46 + 3.22, and 13.25 + 2.44, respectively. In the univariate analysis, the overall COVID-19-related stigma scores were associated with age &gt;30 years, male gender, lower designation (technicians and nursing orderly), lesser education, and married HCWs. In logistic regression model, only male gender was significantly associated with severity of COVID-19 stigma. This study concluded that more than half of frontline HCWs in the Department of Anaesthesia and Critical Care experienced severe social stigma during COVID-19 pandemic, with highest stigma in concerns with public attitude subgroup. Severity of stigma was associated with age, male gender, designation, education, and marital status of HCW.

"A Serial Model of the Interrelationship Between Perceived Vulnerability to Disease, Fear of COVID-19, and Psychological Distress Among Teachers in South Africa","The current study examined the serial relationship between perceived vulnerability to disease, fear of COVID-19, anxiety, and psychological distress among schoolteachers. Participants were South African school teachers (N = 355) who completed the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Questionnaire, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, trait scale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Centre for Epidemiological Depression Scale. A path analysis confirmed that teachers who appraised themselves as more susceptible to disease experienced heightened levels of fear of COVID-19, which led to heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. Specifically, germ aversion and perceived infectability were separately associated with heightened fear of COVID-19, which in turn was associated with heightened anxiety. This serial relationship was associated with heightened levels of hopelessness and depression. The current study extends research on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among a distinct subgroup of the population.

"Exploring Mortality Salience and Pandemic Impact in the Context of COVID-19","Mortality salience refers to a state of conscious awareness of death and the inevitable conclusion of life, associated with psychological terror. The COVID-19 pandemic generated increased awareness of illness and death, and effectuated changes in death cognitions and people's experiences around psychological or sociocognitive domains of media and life goals. To understand these changes, this study administered the Multidimensional Mortality Awareness Measure (Levasseur et al., 2015) to 103 emerging adults in India, post which 6 participants proceeded for a semi-structured interview exploring pandemic experiences, news consumption and goal prioritization, to examine specific areas in relation to death cognition. The thematic analysis demonstrates psychological effects, and discusses developments in health and death-related psychological processes. Focus on career goals and health maintenance, cautious news consumption and disadvantageous impacts on mental health are seen, significant in navigating healthcare measures for emerging adults, as we move forward into this 'new normal'.","Paul, Vasudevan","https://doi.org/10.1177/00302228211056221","20211206","COVID-19; death; goal prioritization; mortality salience; news consumption","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23306,""

We aimed to identify demographic or clinical factors associated with psychiatric admissions where COVID-19 was attributed to contribute to mental state, compared to admissions which did not. A retrospective cohort study was undertaken of inpatients admitted to Northern Psychiatric Unit 1, Northern Hospital in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia during 27/02/2020 to 08/07/2020. Data were extracted for participants who identified COVID-19 as a stressor compared to participants who did not. Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitley rank sum test were used. Thirty six of 242 inpatients reported the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to mental ill health and subsequent admission. Reasons given included social isolation, generalized distress about the pandemic, barriers to support services, disruption to daily routine, impact on employment, media coverage, re-traumatization, cancelled ECT sessions, loss of loved ones, and increased drug use during the lockdown. Chronic medical conditions or psychiatric multimorbidity were positively associated and smoking status was negatively associated with reporting the COVID-19 pandemic as a contributor to mental ill health.

"Characteristics and influence on quality of life of New-onset Pain in critical COVID-19 survivors","Pain is a clinical feature of COVID-19, however data about persistent pain after hospital discharge, especially among ICU survivors is scarce. The aim of this study is to explore the incidence and characteristics of new-onset pain and its impact on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and to quantify the presence of mood disorders in critically ill COVID-19 survivors. This is a preliminary report of PAIN-COVID trial (NCT04394169) presenting a descriptive analysis in critically ill COVID-19 survivors, following in person interview one month after hospital discharge. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory, the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questionnaire and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. HRQoL was evaluated with the EQ 5D/5L, and mood disorders with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). From May 27<sup>th</sup> to July 19<sup>th</sup> , 2020, 203 patients were consecutively screened for eligibility, and 65 were included in this analysis. Of these, 50.8% patients reported new-onset pain; 38.5% clinically significant pain (numerical rating score Ã¢â€°Â¥3 for average pain intensity); 16.9% neuropathic pain; 4.6% pain catastrophizing thoughts, 44.6% pain in Ã¢â€°Â¥2 body sites and 7.7% widespread pain. Patients with new-onset pain had a worse EQ-VAS and EQ index value (p&lt;0.001). Pain intensity was negatively correlated to both the former (Spearman Rho:-0.546, p&lt;0.001) and the latter (Spearman Rho:-0.387, p=0.001).

"Gender-specific psychological and social impact of COVID-19 in Pakistan","COVID-19 has rapidly spread across the world. Women may be especially vulnerable to depression and anxiety as a result of the pandemic. This study attempted to assess how gender affects risk perceptions, anxiety levels and behavioural responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, to recommend gender-responsive health policies. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and questions on their risk perceptions, preventive behaviour and information exposure. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of factors such as age, gender and household income on anxiety levels. Of the 1391 respondents, 478 were women and 913 were men. Women considered their chances of survival to be relatively lower than men (59% v. 73%). They were also more anxious (62% v. 50%) and more likely to adopt precautionary behaviour, such as avoiding going to the hospital (78% v. 71%), not going to work (72% v. 57%) and using disinfectants (93% v. 86%). Men were more likely to trust friends, family and social media as reliable sources of COVID-19 information, whereas women were more likely to trust doctors. Women experience a disproportionate burden of the psychological and social impact of the pandemic compared with men. Involving doctors in healthcare communication targeting women might prove effective.

"Telework during the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal and determinants of job satisfaction: a cross-sectional study","Telework satisfaction is a Public Health concern, intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, and its determinant factors may be related with the negative health effects of teleworking. However, there is still little research exploring this issue. This study aimed to characterize telework during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic in Portugal and to identify the major predictors of telework satisfaction. This is a cross-sectional study aimed at all teleworkers working in Portugal, during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Data were collected through a Google Forms platform online questionnaire distributed by a snowball method on social networks. Descriptive statistics included crude and relative frequency data. The associations between sociodemographic characteristics, self-perceived health, organization of working time, concentration at work, work-life balance, work disconnection, working conditions, and organizational demands (flexibility and organizational trust based on E-work Life Scale) with telework satisfaction were estimated through logistic regression. This study included 1004 participants. Teleworkers satisfaction levels were high (69%). Better concentration at work (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.54; 95%CI 1.01-2.34); the satisfaction with the balance between work life and extra work when teleworking (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.79; 95%CI 1.17-2.74); and higher work flexibility (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.26; 95%CI 1.46-3.49) were good predictors of greater levels of satisfaction with telework. However, its major predictors were the company's trust in teleworkers (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.50; 95%CI 2.89-7.02) and feeling good in the workspace at home (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.72; 95%CI 1.46-9.49). Our findings point that work environment and organizational culture play a crucial role in affecting telework satisfaction. More studies are needed to monitor telework satisfaction and its effects on physical and mental health, so that Public and Occupational Health (and Safety) can be able to identify and implement the best interventions that allow promoting individual health and foster a healthy work environment for teleworkers.","Sousa-Uva, Sousa-Uva, E Sampayo, Serranheira","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12295-2","20211206","COVID 19 pandemic; Ergonomics; Job satisfaction; Occupational health; Telework","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23311,""

Post-traumatic stress symptoms were assessed with the SPRINT-E scale, Perceived Discrimination was assessed with a Spanish version of the scale developed by Molero, and anxiety toward death was assessed with the Spanish version of the Templer scale. All instruments were assessed for internal consistency.The overall frequency of post-traumatic stress symptoms was 23.9%. The frequency by countries was 26.4% in Argentina, 29.8% in Chile, 19.9 in Colombia, and 23.8% in Mexico. Post-traumatic stress symptoms were associated with individual subtle discrimination, anxiety toward the death of the elderly, lack of Personal Protective Equipment, and exposition to the death.The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a mental health burden on health workers in the countries included in the study, not only due to the implications of the disease in the face of exposure to death, but also due to institutional conditions and in which they carry out their work.","AbeldaÃƒÂ±o ZuÃƒÂ±iga, Juanillo-Maluenda, SÃƒÂ¡nchez-Bandala, Burgos, MÃƒÂ¼ller, RodrÃƒÂ­guez LÃƒÂ³pez","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580211061059","20211206","COVID-19; anxiety; healthcare workers; mental health burden; perceived discrimination; post-traumatic stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23313,""
"Psychological distress and resilience in a multicentre sample of adolescents and young adults with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic","Understanding impact of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) on Adolescents and Young Adults (AYA) with cancer is important to inform care. Online survey of 16-24Ã‚Â year olds receiving cancer treatment at eight cancer centres in the UK. We measured: self-perceived increased anxiety since COVID-19, impact of COVID-19 on treatment, life and relationships, PHQ-8, GAD and the two-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). 112 AYA participated. 59.8% had previous mental health difficulties. 78.6% reported COVID-19 having a significant impact on life. 79% reported experiencing increased anxiety since COVID-19.43.4% had moderate-severe PHQ-8 scores and 37.1% GADS-7 scores. Impact on life was associated with moderate-severe PHQ-8 scores (OR 5.23, 95% CI 1.65-16.56, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), impact on relationships with moderate-severe GADS-7 and PHQ-8 score (OR 2.89, 95% CI 1.11-7.54, <i>p</i> = 0,03; OR 3.54, 95% CI 2.32-15.17, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01; OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.11-5.25, <i>p</i> =0.03).

"Spirituality of hopeful risk-taking (Bahala na) among Filipino healthcare workers","Mental health problems are prevalent among medical frontliners, as demonstrated in the study by Ghaleb et al. in the case of the Eastern Mediterranean Region. As mental health can be strengthened by spirituality, this study probed into the spirituality of bahala na of overseas Filipino health care workers. A phenomenological research was conducted that includes an interview of 17 Filipino Catholic migrant nurses in five countries, on the situations when they find themselves exclaiming ""bahala na"" in their work as frontliners, and what this means for them. Affirming the notion of bahala na as an expression of hopeful risk-taking, the study showed that the nurses usually exclaim bahala na when they have done everything in their power in a given situation and they are now leaving the rest to God. The spirituality of bahala na helped the nurses face the stresses brought about by the pandemic, and when tapped, can further aid them in fighting against institutional racism to promote health equity in the medical community.","Tingson, Brazal","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdab393","20211205"," bahala na ; Covid-19; Filipino nurses; mental health; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23315,""
"Cross-Cutting Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic-the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research Experience","At the start of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR) mobilized to rapidly conduct medical research to detect, prevent, and treat the disease in order to minimize the impact of the pandemic on the health and readiness of U.S. Forces. WRAIR's major efforts included the development of the Department of Defense (DoD) COVID-19 vaccine candidate, researching novel drug therapies and monoclonal antibodies, refining and scaling-up diagnostic capabilities, evaluating the impact of viral diversity, assessing the behavioral health of Soldiers, supporting U.S. DoD operational forces overseas, and providing myriad assistance to allied nations. WRAIR personnel have also filled key roles within the whole of government response to the pandemic. WRAIR had to overcome major pandemic-related operational challenges in order to quickly execute a multimillion-dollar portfolio of COVID-19 research. Consequently, the organization learned lessons that could benefit other leaders of medical research organizations preparing for the next pandemic. We identified lessons learned using a qualitative thematic analysis of 76 observation/recommendation pairs from across the organization. These lessons learned were organized under the Army's four pillars of readiness (staffing, training, equipping, and leadership development). To this framework, we added organizing and leading to best capture our experiences within the context of pandemic response. The major lessons learned for organizing were: (1) the pandemic created a need to rapidly pivot to new scientific priorities; (2) necessary health and safety precautions disrupted the flow of normal science and put programs at risk of missing milestones; (3) relationships with partners and allies facilitated medical diplomacy and advancement of U.S. national military and economic goals; and (4) a successful response required interoperability within and across multiple organizations. For equipping: (1) existing infrastructure lacked sufficient capacity and technical capability to allow immediate countermeasure development; (2) critical supply chains were strained; and (3) critical information system function and capacity were suddenly insufficient under maximum remote work. For staffing and training: (1) successful telework required rapid shifts in management, engagement, and accountability methods; and (2) organizational policies and processes had to adapt quickly to support remote staffing. For leading and leadership development (1) engaged, hopeful, and empathetic leadership made a difference; and (2) the workforce benefitted from concerted leadership communication that created a shared understanding of shifting priorities as well as new processes and procedures. An effective pandemic response requires comprehensive institutional preparedness that facilitates flexibility and surge capacity. The single most important action leaders of medical research organizations can take to prepare for the next pandemic is to develop a quick-reaction force that would activate under prespecified criteria to manage reprioritization of all science and support activities to address pandemic response priorities at the velocity of relevance.","Osgood, Froude, Daye, Cabrera, Scherer, Capaldi, Michael, Moon, Lombardini, Peel, Peterson, Teyhen, Murray, O'Connell","https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usab438","20211205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23316,""
"Experiencing and Forecasting COVID-19 Daily Stress on Mental Health Reactivity Across Age and Race","This study systematically evaluates age and race differences in mental health symptoms as they unfold microlongitudinally during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with a focus on within-person reactivity to forecasting and experiencing COVID-19 stress. A daily diary approach was used to examine predictors of daily anxiety and depressive symptoms among 526 adults (White [54%] and Black American [46%]) aged 21-79. A total of 3,605 online diaries were collected for 21 consecutive days between October and November, 2020. In addition to mental health symptoms, participants reported forecasted (next 24 h) stress as well as experienced (past 24 h) stress related to COVID-19. Patterns of reactivity to forecasted and experienced COVID-19 stress depended on age and race. White older adults displayed greater reactivity to COVID-19-related stress than White younger adults, but the effects of COVID-19-related stress were consistently detrimental for the daily anxiety of Black Americans, regardless of age. For Black Americans, age was less negatively associated with depressive symptoms than for White Americans. Increases in experienced COVID-19 stress were also more strongly associated with increases in depressive symptoms for Black Americans relative to White participants. This study moves beyond cross-sectional, descriptive work within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and emphasizes the dynamic nature of within-person reactivity patterns that differ by age and race. Although White older adults experienced an increase in daily anxiety when forecasting COVID-19 stress, the co-occurring pandemic of systemic racism may be more powerful than age-related vulnerabilities for Black adults.","Pearman, Hughes, Coblenz, Smith, Neupert","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab197","20211205","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Reactivity; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23317,""
"Think globally, act locally: Quality improvement as a catalyst for COVID-19 related care during the transitional years","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed distinctive challenges to adolescents and young adults living with spina bifida, especially those from ethic minority populations. With this public health challenge in mind, developing a customized electronic health record to leverage registry data to promote and quantify COVID-19 vaccination uptake among this population is feasible. We provide a brief description of our activities in customizing an electronic health record to track vaccination uptake among adolescents and young adults with spina bifida (AYASB); and the lessons learned, in hopeful support of those scaling-up vaccination delivery for AYASB as they transition to adult-centered care. Thus, as providers think globally and act locally, COVID-19 immunization efforts can be implemented while providing culturally appropriate transition services for individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities.","Castillo, Fremion, Morrison-Jacobus, Bolin, Perez, Acosta, Timmons, Castillo","https://doi.org/10.3233/PRM-210119","20211205","COVID-19; Transition to adult-centered care; blue-marble health; care coordination; health disparities; mental health; quality improvement; spina bifida","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23318,""
"Investigating the impact of COVID-19 on performance and image enhancing drug use","Emerging research has suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic has had some impact on substance use patterns. The aim of the study was to conduct a rapid survey to assess the impact of COVID-19 on performance and image enhancing drug (PIED) use and training, and any subsequent negative physical or mental health outcomes. During 2020, a convenience sample of 60 PIED consumers (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26.69; 68.3% located outside Australia) completed a quantitative anonymous online survey exploring how the coronavirus pandemic impacted patterns of PIED use and associated exercise habits. The survey was administered via the Qualtrics platform and distributed online through PIED forums as well as through the investigators' networks. Participants were asked about their PIED use and exercise habits prior to and during restricted movement 'lockdowns'. During pre-COVID, the majority of the sample opted to 'blast-cruise' (an initial high dose, followed by a lower maintenance dose; 71.7%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°43). During lockdown, 45% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27) reported a change in PIED use as a result of the restrictions. In light of health concerns during COVID-19, a majority of men (60%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36) did not take any extra precautions relating to their PIED use. A subgroup of men ceased using PIEDs completely (16.7%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) with the majority (80%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8) of that subgroup following post-cycle therapy (PCT) of some kind. Only a small proportion of the sample reported negative mental health issues as a result of PCT access issues. This study contributes to the emerging literature of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on substance use, specifically PIED use among men. The results suggest that the pandemic did influence the choice of PIEDs that participants consumed, although there was little disruption to patterns of exercise, an important aspect of PIED use. Of the men who did cease use completely, the majority reported little issue with PCT access; those who reported difficulty accessing PCT compounds indicated experience some mental health concerns related to ceasing their PIED use. Clinicians and those who come into contact with this group should be alert for any negative physical or mental health concerns resulting from disrupted or ceased PIED use.","Dunn, Piatkowski","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00571-8","20211205","AnabolicÃ¢â‚¬â€œandrogenic steroids; COVID-19; Exercise; Performance and image enhancing drug use; Steroids","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-07","",23319,""
