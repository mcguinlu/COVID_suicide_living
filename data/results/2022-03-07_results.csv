"Association between COVID-19 Risk-Mitigation Behaviors and Specific Mental Disorders in Youth","Importance: Although studies of adults show that pre-existing mental disorders increase risk for COVID-19 infection and severity, there is limited information about this association among youth. Mental disorders in general as well as specific types of disorders may influence their ability to comply with risk-mitigation strategies to reduce COVID-19 infection and transmission. Objective: To examine associations between specific mental disorders and COVID-19 risk-mitigation practices among 314 female and 514 male youth. Design: Youth compliance (rated as Never, Sometimes, Often, or Very often/Always) with risk mitigation was reported by parents on the CoRonavIruS Health Impact Survey (CRISIS) in January 2021. Responses were summarized using factor analysis of risk mitigation, and their associations with lifetime mental disorders (assessed via structured diagnostic interviews) were identified with linear regression analyses (adjusted for covariates). All analyses used R Project for Statistical Computing for Mac (v.4.0.5). Setting: The Healthy Brain Network (HBN) in New York City Participants: 314 female and 514 male youth (ages 5-21) Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): COVID-19 risk mitigation behaviors among youth Results: A two-factor model was the best-fitting solution. Factor 1 (avoidance behaviors) included avoiding groups, indoor settings, and other peoples homes; avoidance was more likely among youth with any anxiety disorder (p=.01). Factor 2 (hygiene behaviors) included using hand sanitizer, washing hands, and maintaining social distance; practicing hygiene was less likely among youth with ADHD (combined type) (p=.02). Mask wearing, which did not load on either factor, was not associated with any mental health disorder. Conclusion and Relevance: Findings suggest that education and monitoring of risk-mitigation strategies in certain subgroups of youth may reduce risk of exposure to COVID-19 and other contagious diseases. Additionally, they highlight the need for greater attention to vaccine prioritization for individuals with ADHD.

"Adaptation, Transformation and Resilience in Healthcare Comment on ""Government Actions and Their Relation to Resilience in Healthcare During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New South Wales, Australia and Ontario, Canada""","Adaptive capacity is a critical component of building resilience in healthcare (RiH). Adaptive capacity comprises the ability of a system to cope with and adapt to disturbances. However, ""shocks,"" such as the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, can potentially exceed critical adaptation thresholds and lead to systemic collapse. To effectively manage healthcare systems during periods of crises, both adaptive and transformative changes are necessary. This commentary discusses adaptation and transformation as two complementary, integral components of resilience and applies them to healthcare. We treat resilience as an emergent property of complex systems that accounts for multiple, often disparately distinct regimes in which multiple processes (eg, adaptation, recovery) are subsumed and operate. We argue that Convergence Mental Health and other transdisciplinary paradigms such as Brain Capital and One Health can facilitate resilience planning and management in healthcare systems.","Angeler, Eyre, Berk, Allen, Hynes, Linkov","https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2022.7043","20220306","COVID-19; Health Policy; Healthcare Management; Healthcare Systems; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-07","",27991,""
