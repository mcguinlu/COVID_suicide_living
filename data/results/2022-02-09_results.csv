"Challenges to self-isolation among contacts of cases of COVID-19: a national telephone survey in Wales","Self-isolation is challenging and adherence is dependent on a range of psychological, social and economic factors. We aimed to identify the challenges experienced by contacts of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases to better target support and minimize the harms of self-isolation. The Contact Adherence Behavioural Insights Study (CABINS) was a 15-minute telephone survey conducted with confirmed contacts of COVID-19 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2027), identified through the NHS Wales Test Trace Protect (TTP) database. Younger people (aged 18-29Ã‚Â years) were three times more likely to report mental health concerns (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.05-4.86) and two times more likely to report loneliness (aOR: 1.96, CI: 1.37-2.81) compared to people aged over 60Ã‚Â years. Women were 1.5 times more likely to experience mental health concerns (aOR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.20-1.92) compared to men. People with high levels of income precarity were eight times more likely to report financial challenges (aOR: 7.73, CI: 5.10-11.74) and three times more likely to report mental health concerns than their more financially secure counterparts (aOR: 3.08, CI: 2.22-4.28). Self-isolation is particularly challenging for younger people, women and those with precarious incomes. Providing enhanced support is required to minimize the harms of self-isolation.","Isherwood, Kyle, Gray, Davies","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdac002","20220208","COVID-19; challenges; financial stability; health inequalities; self-isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26672,""
"Technology Use Among Persons with Memory Concerns and Their Caregivers in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","Stay-at-home orders and other public health measures designed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 have increased isolation among persons with memory concerns (PWMC; individuals diagnosed with cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease or related dementias). The pandemic has also exacerbated challenges for family members who care for PWMC. Although technology has demonstrated the potential to improve the social connections and mental health of PWMC and their family caregivers, previous research shows that older adults may be reluctant to adopt new technologies. We aimed to understand why and how some PWMC and their caregivers altered their use of mainstream technology, like smartphones and fitness trackers, and assistive technology to adapt to lifestyle changes (e.g. increased isolation) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data collected in 20 qualitative interviews from June to August 2020 with 20 PWMC and family caregiver dyads, we assessed changes in and barriers to everyday technology use following the implementation of COVID-19 mitigation strategies in the United States. Zoom video conferencing was utilized to conduct the interviews to protect the health of the participants who were primarily older adults. Using qualitative thematic analysis we identified three themes which explained motivations for using technology during a pandemic: 1) maintaining social connection, 2) alleviating boredom, and 3) increasing caregiver respite. Results further revealed lingering barriers to PWMC and caregiver adoption of technologies, including: 1) PWMC dependence upon caregivers, 2) low technological literacy, and 3) limitations of existing technology. This in-depth investigation suggests that technology can provide PWMC with more independence and offer caregivers relief from caregiver burden during periods of prolonged isolation.","Albers, Mikal, Millenbah, Finlay, Jutkowitz, Mitchell, Horn, Gaugler","https://doi.org/10.2196/31552","20220208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26673,""
"Effect of the Imacoco Care psychoeducation website on improving psychological distress among workers under COVID-19 pandemic: a randomized controlled trial","The prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected mental health among workers. Psychoeducational intervention via an Internet website could be effective for primary prevention of mental illness among workers in the current COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the effect of a newly developed online psychoeducational website named ""Imacoco Care"" on reducing psychological distress and fear about COVID-19 infection among workers. Participants in the present study were recruited from registered members of a web survey company in Japan. Participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. Participants in the intervention group were invited to access the Imacoco Care program within a month after the baseline survey. Kessler's Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) were obtained at baseline, 1-, and 3-month follow-ups. A total of 1200 workers were randomly allocated to an intervention or control group (n = 600 for each). The Imacoco Care intervention group showed a significant favorable effect on K6 (p = 0.03) with a small effect size (d = -0.14), and an adverse effect on FCV-19S (p = 0.01) with a small effect size (d = 0.16) at 3-month follow-up. In the per-protocol analysis (including only participants who had read the Imacoco Care content at least one time), the Imacoco Care intervention group also showed a significant favorable effect on reducing K6 (p = 0.03), while an adverse effect on FCV-19S was not significant (p = 0.06) in the intervention group at 3-month follow-up. A web-based psychoeducation approach may be effective for improving psychological distress among workers; however, it may be important not only to distribute information but also to encourage active engagement with the content of the program to prevent adverse effects of psychoeducational intervention.

"Inpatient rehabilitation can improve functional outcomes of post-intensive care unit COVID-19 patients-a prospective study","To evaluate the impact of an inpatient multimodal and intensive rehabilitation program on neuromuscular, respiratory, and functional impairments of post-ICU COVID-19 patients. Prospective study including post-ICU COVID-19 survivors consecutively admitted to a rehabilitation centre. Rehabilitation was conducted by an interdisciplinary team. Medical Research Council (MRC) score, maximum expiratory pressure (MEP), maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), peak cough flow (PCF), Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), Brief Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Brief-BESTest), Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°min Sit to Stand Test (1' STST), 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°min Walking Test (6MWT), Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), Functional Independence Measure (FIM) were assessed at admission (T0) and discharge (T1). A total of 42 patients were included. After 32.00;26.00Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of inpatient rehabilitation, there was a significant improvement in limb and respiratory muscle strength, cough effectiveness, fatigue, balance, exercise capacity, and in the ability to perform activities of daily living. Advanced age, longer acute care hospitalization, depressive symptoms, and cognitive deficits were associated with poorer functional outcomes. Post-ICU COVID-19 patients present multiple sequelae with detrimental functional impact. An adapted interdisciplinary rehabilitation program is essential for a thorough evaluation of these patients and results in significant functional gains.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPost-ICU COVID-19 survivors present multiple sequelae and disabilities.An intensive and interdisciplinary inpatient rehabilitation results in significant improvement in limb and respiratory muscle strength, cough effectiveness, fatigue, balance, exercise capacity, and ability to perform activities of daily living.Timely referral from the acute care setting to rehabilitation services is crucial to minimize the functional impact of severe multisystemic disease and prolonged hospitalization.","Rodrigues, Costa, Santos, Diogo, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Barroso, Almeida, Vaz, Lima","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2022.2032408","20220208","Covid-19; disability; post-intensive care syndrome; rehabilitation; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26675,""
"Delivery of an online psychosocial recovery program during COVID-19: A survey of young people attending a youth mental health service","The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid move of mental health services to being delivered online. This included the delivery of a psychosocial recovery program (PRP) delivered in youth mental health services in Melbourne, Australia which consists of groups that address functional recovery. At the time, there was limited evidence about how this switch in service provision would be received by service users or what impact the pandemic was having on their mental health. Young people engaged with the PRP between March and May 2020 were sent a link to complete an online survey that was co-developed by young people and clinicians. Attendance data at groups were extracted as a proximal measure of feasibility and acceptability. A total of 44 young people undertook the survey with the domains of wellbeing most impacted by lockdown being work/study, motivation and social connection. Groups provided online were generally well attended during lockdown, particularly those that had a focus on therapeutic content. Young people indicated little preference for continuing to attend groups run purely online when restrictions eased, with many expressing a preference for these to be offered face-to-face or in a combined format. These findings suggest that implementation of online psychosocial groups during periods of lockdown is both feasible and acceptable. Whilst young people found accessing groups online to be of benefit at the time, they felt that continued substitution of face-to-face groups would not necessarily be preferable and clinical services should consider these preferences in their long-term service delivery.","Somaiya, Thompson, O'Donoghue, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13280","20220208","functional recovery; online; psychosocial recovery; survey; youth mental health services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26676,""
"Latent class analysis of loneliness and connectedness in US young adults during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States has exacerbated a number of mental health conditions and problems related to prolonged social isolation. While COVID-19 has led to greater loneliness and a lack of social connectedness, little is known about who are the most affected and how they are impacted. Therefore, we performed a Latent Class Analysis using items from two scales - the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Social Connectedness Scale - to characterize different experiences of loneliness and connectedness, examine their relationship with mental health and substance use symptoms, including depression, anxiety, drinking, and drug use. Data were drawn from an anonymous one-time online survey examining the mental health of 1008 young adults (18-35 years old) during COVID-19. A latent class analysis (LCA) was conducted to observe and identify classes based on responses to loneliness and connectedness scale items, and to examine the existence of subgroups among this young adult population. We identified a 4-class model of loneliness and connectedness: (1) Lonely and Disconnected - highest probabilities in items of loneliness and disconnectedness, (2) Moderately Lonely and Disconnected - adaptive levels of some isolation and disconnection during COVID-19, (3) Ambivalent Feelings - displaying negative responses in particular to negatively-worded items while simultaneously affirming positively worded items, and (4) Connected and Not Lonely - lowest probabilities in items of loneliness and disconnectedness. Key findings include (1) the delineation of classes by levels of loneliness and connectedness showcasing differential mental health and substance use symptoms, (2) the utility of item-level evaluation with LCA in determining specific classes of people in need of outreach and intervention, and (3) the promise of social connection to bolster resilience in young adults.","Schmidt, Feaster, Horigian, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1002/jclp.23326","20220208","COVID-19; latent class analysis; loneliness; mental health; social connectedness; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26677,""
"Dyadic associations between COVID-19-related stress and mental well-being among parents and children in Hong Kong: An actor-partner interdependence model approach","The spread of COVID-19 and its subsequent social distancing policies have profoundly impacted the lives of parents and children. Prolonged exposure to parenting-related responsibilities and heightened levels of family conflict under stay-at-home orders coupled with reduced access to support systems and resources have rendered parents and children more prone to stress and mental health difficulties. Drawing on a transactional model of parent-child interactions, the present study applied an actor-partner interdependence model approach to examine the transactional relationship between COVID-19-related stress and mental well-being among parents and children. Data from 109 Chinese parent-child dyads in Hong Kong were included in the study. Parents and their 8- to 10-year-old children completed a questionnaire on COVID-19-related stress, parent-child relationships, and mental well-being. The results showed that 53.2% and 30.3% of the parents and children, respectively, showed poor mental well-being, indicating possible emotional problems. Both actor and partner effects of parent COVID-19-related stress were found. Parent COVID-19-related stress was indirectly related to lower levels of parent and child mental well-being, through the mediation of parent-child conflict. To facilitate psychological adjustment following the COVID-19 outbreak, effective family-based mental health and parenting interventions are needed to promote family cohesion and alleviate stress-induced psychological symptoms. Even in the time of social distancing, telepsychotherapy and other online non-psychotherapeutic interventions can serve as a valid alternative for parents and children who experience excessive distress. Implications for psychological services, family-friendly policies, and social protection measures are also discussed.

"Primary-secondary school transition under Covid-19: Exploring the perceptions and experiences of children, parents/guardians, and teachers","The transition from primary to secondary school is a major life event for eleven-year-old children in the United Kingdom, where they face simultaneous changes. Following the outbreak of Covid-19, transfer children face additional uncertainty on top of this. Negotiation of the multiple challenges, combined with the reduced support associated with Covid-19, could have a negative impact on children's school adjustment and mental health. Given the rapidity of changes associated with Covid-19, there are key empirical and practical gaps on how best to support children as they negotiate these two key events. To date, there is no published research which has explored the experiences of transfer children, and that of their parents and teachers during this time. The present research aimed to narrow this research gap by answering the research question: What are parents', children's, and teachers' experiences of primary-secondary school transition during Covid-19? This research used a series of UK wide surveys to gather data from 101 Year 7 children, 88 Year 7 parents, 26 primary school teachers, and 40 secondary school teachers using a mixture of open and closed questions. The data were analysed using Thematic Framework Analysis, taking an inductive-open coding approach. All three stakeholders reported negative impacts of Covid-19 on the transition, for example, in terms of missed opportunities. There were also many comments about the emotional impact of Covid-19 on children, parents, and teachers. Numerous strategies were reported that were used to meet children's needs pre and post-transition, highlighting areas of good practice, along with practical suggestions for how to approach transition in the future.

Throughout the pandemic, people who used drugs had greater odds of contracting COVID-19, increased drug use due to COVID-related stress, and heightened levels of anxiety and depression. This exploratory qualitative study examined the specific ways the pandemic negatively impacted people who use drugs. <b>Methods:</b> Qualitative interviews with 24 people who use drugs and 20 substance use harm reduction workers were conducted. Data from the qualitative interviews were analyzed using applied thematic analysis to identify emergent themes based on the a priori research goals. <b>Results:</b> Thematic analysis identified several common experiences during the pandemic among people who use drugs. These included mental distress due to financial strain and social isolation; increased drug use; increased risky drug-seeking and use behaviors due to changes in the drug markets; and reduced access to harm reduction, treatment, and recovery support services. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our study highlighted critical systemic failures that contributed to the rise in overdose deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic. Addressing these challenges through policy reform and improved funding models will ensure the sustainability of harm reduction services and increase access to substance use treatment among highly vulnerable people who use drugs.","Conway, Samora, Brinkley, Jeong, Clinton, Claborn","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1309886/v1","20220208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26680,""
"Predictors of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive the COVID-19 booster vaccine: An observational study of 22,139 fully vaccinated adults in the UK","The continued success of the COVID-19 vaccination programme in the UK will depend on widespread uptake of booster vaccines. However, there is evidence of hesitancy and unwillingness to receive the booster vaccine, even in fully vaccinated adults. Identifying factors associated with COVID-19 booster vaccine intentions specifically in this population is therefore critical. We used data from 22,139 fully vaccinated adults who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Multinomial logistic regression examined predictors of uncertainty and unwillingness (versus willingness) to receive a COVID-19 booster vaccine (measured 22 November 2021 to 6 December 2021), including (i) socio-demographic factors, (ii) COVID-19 related factors (e.g., having been infected with COVID-19), and (iii) initial intent to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the four months following the announcement in the UK that the vaccines had been approved (2 December 2020 to 31 March 2021). 4% of the sample reported that they were uncertain about receiving a COVID-19 booster vaccine, and a further 4% unwilling. Initial uncertainty and unwillingness to accept the first COVID-19 vaccine in 2020-21 were each associated with over five times the risk of being uncertain about and unwilling to accept a booster vaccine. Healthy adults (those without a pre-existing physical health condition) were also more likely to be uncertain or unwilling to receive a booster vaccine. In addition, low levels of current stress about catching or becoming seriously ill from COVID-19, consistently low compliance with COVID-19 government guidelines during periods of strict restrictions (e.g., lockdowns), lower levels of educational qualification, lower socio-economic position, and age below 45 years were all associated with uncertainty and unwillingness. Our findings highlight that there are a range of factors that predict booster intentions, with the strongest predictor being previous uncertainty and unwillingness. Two other concerning patterns also emerged from our results. First, administration of booster vaccinations may increase social inequalities in experiences of COVID-19 as adults from lower socio-economic backgrounds are also most likely to be uncertain or unwilling to accept a booster vaccine as well as most likely to be seriously affected by the virus. Second, some of those most likely to spread COVID-19 (i.e., those with poor compliance with guidelines) are most likely to be uncertain and unwilling. Public health messaging should be tailored specifically to these groups.

"Youth athletes sleep more, practice less, and may lose interest in playing sports due to social distancing mandates","In-person sport participation was suspended across the United States in the spring of 2020 to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). The purpose of this study was to survey the impact of COVID-19 on young athletes during a period of social and organized sports restrictions. An anonymous cross-sectional survey study was conducted of youth athletes in the midst of social distancing mandates and consisted of six components: demographics, sport participation, changes in sport-related goals/aspirations, sleep habits, and measures of anxiety and depression. 711 individuals who accessed the survey link yielded 575 (81%) participants with responses available for analysis. All respondents (aged 13.0Ã‚Â years) played organized sports, 62% were single-sport athletes, and 74% considered high-level. Participants were training Ã¢Ë†Â¼3.3Ã‚Â h less per week, spending more time outside, and 86% of participants continued to train while social distancing. Sleep duration increased (Ã¢Ë†Â¼1.2Ã‚Â h/night) and sleep quality improved in 29% of young athletes. Additionally, 22% and 28% reported PROMISÃ‚Â® anxiety and depression scores characterized as 'mild', 'moderate', or 'severe'. Older single-sport participants reported higher depression scores, while higher anxiety scores were seen in female participants with fewer years played. 10% of young athletes and 20% of teenagers changed their sports-related goals. Training style modifications, decreased training, and increased sleep quantity and quality were positive effects of COVID-19 restrictions, while athletic aspirational changes were undesirable effects. Single-sport athletes may be at greater risk for psychological symptoms when their routine is altered.","Ellis, Ulman, John Wagner, Carpenter, Gale, Shea, Wilson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101722","20220208","COVID-19; Psychological Health; Specialization; Youth Sports","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26682,""

"[Suicide mortality in Spain in 2020: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic]","Suicide constitutes a major concern with evident contribution to global mortality worldwide. Evidence on suicide trends is mixed in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Spain may be an at-risk country for increased suicide risk in the time of COVID-19 pandemic due to prolonged restrictions and lockdown, elevated COVID-19 wave recurrence and related mental health impact. This brief report aims to provide some insight into the suicide mortality trends in the first COVID-19 pandemic year in Spain, using national data. Data from the National Death Index were used. Annual mortality rate was calculated at a province level under random-effects models for the 2019 and 2020 years. Poisson timeseries regression was used to study the relationship between monthly suicide mortality and COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and lockdown, and second COVID-19 wave peak covariates. 3,671 people died by suicide in 2019 in Spain and 3,941 people died by suicide in 2020. The random-effects mortality rate in 2019 was 8.3 (CI<sub>95</sub> = [7.6, 9.0]) per 100,000 inhabitants, and mortality rate in 2020 was 8.9 (CI<sub>95</sub> = [8.3, 9.6]). No significant differences between mortality rates were found (<i>p</i> =.18). The Poisson regression showed a significant relationship between the COVID-19 outbreak and suicide mortality trend, with <i>OR</i> = 1.07 (CI<sub>95</sub> = [1.02, 1.12]). Although annual mortality rates were not significantly different, an increased suicide risk was found from May, 2020 onwards. Our results claim for action to tackle suicide in the post-pandemic era taking into account the discouraging upcoming scenario.","de la Torre-Luque, Pemau, Perez-Sola, Ayuso-Mateos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2022.01.003","20220208","2020; COVID-19 pandemic; Mortality; Spain; Suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26684,""
"The anxiety of not knowing: Diagnosis uncertainty about COVID-19","The emergence and swift global spread of COVID-19 brought increased anxiety worldwide (SantabÃƒÂ¡rbara et al. (<i>Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology &amp; Biological Psychiatry, 109,</i> 110207,Ã‚Â 2021)). Research regarding the COVID-19 outbreak addressed factors that contribute to anxiety people experienced as they tried to handle the changes in their lives associated with COVID-19 (Holmes et al. (<i>The Lancet Psychiatry, 7</i>(6), 547-560, 2020)). This paper focuses on diagnosis uncertainty as a particular source of anxiety. We use self-reported anxiety measures to understand how different stressors, and particularly how being sick or being unsure if one or one's close friends or relatives are sick, relate to overall anxiety levels. Five-hundred and thirty-three participants from a country with a stringent COVID-19 testing policy were surveyed in the spring of 2020 on various aspects of their anxiety and risk for depression, as well as on whether they or their friends or family had COVID-19. Analysis of survey results found that anxiety related to uncertainty regarding whether the survey responder or their friends or family were carrying COVID-19 may be even greater than fear of the virus itself. This paper discusses directional issues related to this finding and offers policy implications for decreasing anxiety during pandemics for certain types of communities.Ã‚Â In addition to the main findings regarding diagnosis uncertainty and anxiety, this paper's results also indicate the importance of providing participants with an option for ""not sure"" in closed questions and imply the increased knowledge that can be gained by analyzing an unsure response independently of ""yes"" or ""no"".","Levine, Kay, Shapiro","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-02783-y","20220208","Anxiety; COVID-19; Diagnosis; Testing; Uncertainty","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26685,""
"Performance of concrete containing recycled masks used for personal protection during coronavirus pandemic","After the coronavirus outbreak, a tremendous amount of personal protective equipment has been produced and used by the health service and every human. Proper medical waste management becomes an important problem, which must be solved with a minimal environmental impact. The presented manuscript introduces the recycling process, during which personal protection masks are transformed into polypropylene fibers being an addition to a concrete mixture. The designed recycling procedure provides the entire disinfection of probably contaminated medical wastes, is straightforward, and potentially enables one to modify the properties of the final product. The applied dosage referred to 1 mask per 1Ã‚Â L of concrete. The final product of face masks processing was studied using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, surface free energy, contact angle measurements, and melt flow index. The analysis indicated that polypropylene is its main component. Two concrete mixtures were composed, i.e., with the addition of processed masks and the reference one. The following properties were determined to compare the modified concrete with the reference one: compressive and tensile strength, frost resistance, water transport properties, resistance to high temperature. The obtained results indicated that the addition of processed masks slightly increased the compressive strength (by about 5%) and decreased the tensile strength (by about 3%). Simultaneously, it was reported that the addition did not affect material properties related to concrete durability as frost resistance, water permeability, and fire performance. The results evinced, that the addition of processed facemasks into concrete did not deteriorate its properties. Therefore, it is a possible way of the protective masks processing and reusing with the high recycling capacity. Further study should be conducted to optimize the dosing and to modify the properties of PP strings to improve hardened concrete properties.","Koniorczyk, Bednarska, Masek, Cichosz","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2022.126712","20220208","COVID-19; Maskcrete; Modified concrete; Pandemic wastes; Polypropylene fibers; Protection masks","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26686,""
"Cancer as a risk factor for distress and its interactions with sociodemographic variables in the context of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic poses a psychological challenge, especially for individuals with chronic illnesses. The aim of this study was to investigate associations of cancer with distress, including its interplay with further risk and protective factors. We conducted a representative survey of the German population (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2503, including NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°144 with a cancer diagnosis) during the first wave of the pandemic. In multiple linear and logistic regression analyses, we tested associations of cancer with depression and anxiety symptoms and suicidal ideation. We also investigated moderating effects of age, gender, income, living situation, marital status, and loneliness. Individuals with cancer were more likely to report anxiety symptoms (Ãâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.061), suicidal ideation (Ãâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.050), and loneliness (Ãâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.044) than other participants. In regression analyses that controlled for sociodemographic differences, cancer was still associated with anxiety symptoms. We also observed interaction effects, indicating that this relation was especially strong in men with cancer and that cancer survivors with a low income were particularly likely to report anxiety symptoms. The findings demonstrate that cancer survivors are a vulnerable group and that factors of different life domains interact in shaping well-being in the population, necessitating comprehensive risk assessment and support offers during the pandemic and beyond.","Ernst, Beutel, BrÃƒÂ¤hler","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-06016-x","20220208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26687,""
"Neurologic Outcomes of Survivors of COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Requiring Intubation","To describe 3-6-month neurologic outcomes of survivors of COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome, invasively ventilated in the ICU. A bicentric prospective study during the two first waves of the pandemic (March to May and September to December, 2020). Two academic hospital ICUs, Paris, France. Adult COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome survivors, invasively ventilated in the ICU, were eligible for a neurologic consultation between 3 and 6 months post ICU discharge. Follow-up by face-to-face neurologic consultation. The primary endpoint was favorable functional outcome defined by a modified Rankin scale score less than 2, indicating survival with no significant disability. Secondary endpoints included mild cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score &lt; 26), ICU-acquired weakness (Medical Research Council score &lt; 48), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression score &gt; 7), and posttraumatic stress disorder (posttraumatic stress disorder checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 score &gt; 30). Of 54 eligible survivors, four non-French-speaking patients were excluded, eight patients were lost-to-follow-up, and one died during follow-up. Forty-one patients were included. Time between ICU discharge and neurologic consultation was 3.8 months (3.6-5.9 mo). A favorable functional outcome was observed in 16 patients (39%) and mild cognitive impairment in 17 of 33 patients tested (52%). ICU-acquired weakness, depression or anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder were reported in six of 37 cases (16%), eight of 31 cases (26%), and two of 27 cases (7%), respectively. Twenty-nine patients (74%) required rehabilitation (motor, cognitive, or psychologic). ICU and hospital lengths of stay, tracheostomy, and corticosteroids were negatively associated with favorable outcome. By contrast, use of alpha-2 agonists during ICU stay was associated with favorable outcome. COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring intubation led to slight-to-severe functional disability in about 60% of survivors 4 months after ICU discharge. Cognitive impairment, muscle weakness, and psychologic symptoms were frequent. A large multicenter study is warranted to allow identification of modifiable factors for improving long-term outcome.","Jaquet, Legouy, Le Fevre, Grinea, Sinnah, Franchineau, Patrier, Marzouk, Wicky, Alexis Geoffroy, Arnoult, Vledouts, de Montmollin, Bouadma, Timsit, Sharshar, Sonneville","https://doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0000000000005500","20220208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26688,""
"Health related behaviours and physical activity level of hypertensive individuals during COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, all countries implemented lockdown to prevent transmission of coronavirus. The prolonged stay-at-home process created some unfavourable effects like unhealthy lifestyle, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour especially in patients with cardiovascular risk. Hypertensive individuals are also affected in the pandemic because of limited access to healthcare services, screening, and altered lifestyles. We aimed to investigate physical activity (PA) level, sedentary behaviour, mental health and healthy lifestyle behaviours in patients with hypertension and compare these parameters with healthy controls. This prospective, cross-sectional study included 40 hypertensive and 40 age-sex matched healthy controls. We assessed PA with the International Physical Activity Questionnaire long-form, quality of life with Short-Form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire, anxiety and depression with Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and lifestyle behaviours with Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile Scale-II (HPLP-II). Moderate and vigorous PA levels of hypertensives' were statistically lower than healthy controls (P = 0.001; P = 0.003, respectively). Hypertensive patients exhibited lower SF-36 physical function (P = 0.001), energy/vitality (P = 0.042), body pain scores than those of healthy controls (P = 0.007). Although HADS-anxiety, depression scores were similar (P &gt; 0.05), the depression ratio (45%) was more common in the hypertensive group during the lockdown. The main findings are that hypertensive patients have lower PA levels and worse quality of life than healthy controls during the pandemic. In addition, the presence of depression is more common among hypertensive patients. Considering unhealthy lifestyles, governments, and health professionals should take some precautions and plan interventions against physical inactivity. As known, providing regular physical activity is a keystone to fighting against cardiovascular disease.","Durukan, Vardar Yagli, Calik Kutukcu, Sener, Tokgozoglu","https://doi.org/10.1097/MRR.0000000000000519","20220208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26689,""
"Early tracheostomy: on the cutting edge, some benefit more than others","The decision to undergo early tracheostomy in critically ill patients has been the subject of multiple studies in recent years, including several meta-analyses and a large-scale examination of the National Impatient Sampling (NIS) database. The research has focused on different patient populations, and identified common outcomes measures related to ventilation. At the crux of the new research is the decision to undergo an additional invasive procedure, mainly tracheostomy, rather than attempt endotracheal tube ventilation with or without early extubation. Notably, recent research indicates that neurological and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients seem to have an exaggerated benefit from early tracheostomy. Recent studies of patients undergoing early tracheostomy have shown decreases in ventilator associated pneumonia, ventilator duration and duration of ICU stay. However, these studies have shown mixed data with respect to mortality and length of hospitalization. Such advantages only become apparent with large-scale examination. Confounding the overall discussion is that the research has focused on heterogeneous groups, including neurosurgical ICU patients, general ICU patients, and most recently, intubated COVID-19 patients. Specific populations such as neurosurgical and COVID-19 patients have clearly defined benefits following early tracheostomy. Although the benefit is less pronounced, there does seem to be an advantage in general ICU patients with regards to ventilator-free days and lower incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. In these patients, large-scale examination points to a clear mortality benefit.","Craven, Slaughter, Potter","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACO.0000000000001114","20220208","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26690,""

Specific objectives are to (1) develop and refine a digital health intervention (DHI) that supports patient assessment, monitoring and remote rehabilitation; (2) develop implementation models that support sustainable deployment at scale; (3) evaluate the impact of the DHI on recovery trajectories and (4) identify and mitigate health inequalities due to the digital divide. Mixed-methods, theoretically informed, single-arm prospective study, combining methods drawn from engineering/computer science with those from biomedicine. There are four work packages (WP), one for each objective. WP1 focuses on identifying user requirements and iteratively developing the intervention to meet them; WP2 combines qualitative data from users with learning from implementation science and normalisation process theory, to promote adoption, scale-up, spread and sustainability of the intervention; WP3 uses quantitative demographic, clinical and resource use data collected by the DHI to determine illness trajectories and how these are affected by use of the DHI; while WP4 focuses on identifying and mitigating health inequalities and overarches the other three WPs. Ethical approval obtained from East Midlands - Derby Research Ethics Committee (reference 288199). Our dissemination strategy targets three audiences: (1) Policy makers, Health service managers and clinicians responsible for delivering long COVID-19 services; (2) patients and the public; (3) academics.

"Qualitative analysis of the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response on paediatric health services in North of Scotland and North of England","To capture the extent and impact of changes in the delivery of child health services in the UK, resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic response, from the perspectives of a range of child healthcare providers. National Health Service commissioned/delivered healthcare services in two regional settings in the UK: North of Scotland (NOS) and North East and North Cumbria (NENC) in England. Purposive sample of 39 child healthcare professionals including paediatricians, community/specialist nurses, allied health professionals and mental health professionals, from across the two regions (22 in NOS, 17 in NENC). Semistructured qualitative interviews conducted via telephone between June and October 2020, fully transcribed and analysed in NVivo V.11 using thematic analysis. Extensive changes across a range of paediatric services were rapidly implemented to support the pandemic response and ongoing healthcare delivery. New ways of working emerged, principally to control the spread of the virus. Keeping users and their families out of hospital was an urgent driver for change. The changes had considerable impact on the health and well-being of staff with many experiencing radical changes to their working conditions and roles. However, there were some positive changes noted: some practitioners felt empowered and listened to by decision makers; some of the usual bureaucratic barriers to change were lifted; staff saw improved collaboration and joint working across the system; and some new ways of working were seen to be more efficient. Interviewees perceived the implications for children and their families to be profound, particularly with regard to self-care, relationships with practitioners and timely access to services. Despite the challenges experienced by staff, the pandemic provided an opportunity for positive, lasting change. It is vital to capitalise on this opportunity to benefit patient outcomes and to 'build back' services in a more sustainable way.","Gadsby, Christie-de Jong, Bhopal, Corlett, Turner","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-056628","20220208","COVID-19; paediatrics; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26696,""
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 lockdown on staff and residents of nursing and care homes in Belgium and EHPADs France","More than a third of the world's population is currently living under lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. Lockdown measures have been in place in many countries for several weeks. The health authorities are waging war against COVID-19 and have to provide information to the public on it while facing many unknowns about the virus. What impact does this have on mental health? What impact can lockdown have upon a population? What psychological impact will this lockdown have on elderly people living in nursing and care homes in Belgium and EHPADs France? We are not aware of any French-language research which has been published on the psychological aspects of the coronavirus among the population.

"Preparation and characterization of immobilized 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor stationary phase for high throughput screening of the receptor-binding ligands from complex systems like Curcuma wenyujin Y H Chen et C Ling extract","The incidence of depression has increased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This disease is closely associated with serotonin <sub>1A</sub> (5-HT<sub>1A</sub>) receptor and often treated by complex prescription containing Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling. Therefore, we hypothesized that this herb contains bioactive compounds specially binding to the receptor. However, the rapid discovery of new ligands of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor is still challenging due to the lack of efficient screening methods. To address this problem, we developed and characterized a novel approach for the rapid screening of ligands by using immobilized 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor as the chromatographic stationary phase. Briefly, haloalkane dehalogenase was fused at the C-terminal of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor, and the modified 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor was immobilized on amino-microspheres by the reaction between haloalkane dehalogenase and 6-chlorohexanoic acid linker. Scanning electron microscope and X-ray photo-electron were used to characterize the morphology and element of the immobilized receptor. The binding of three specific ligands to 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor was investigated by two different methods. Moreover, we examined the feasibility of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor colume in high throughput screening of new ligands from complex systems as exemplified by Curcuma wenyujin Y. H. Chen et C. Ling. Gweicurculactone, 2-hydroxy-1-(3,4-dihydroxybenzene)-7-(4'-hydroxybezene)-heptane and curcuminol F were identified as the ligands of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor with the binding energies of -7.06Ã‚Â kcal/mol, -7.77Ã‚Â kcal/mol and -5.26Ã‚Â kcal/mol, respectively. Collectively, these results indicated that the immobilized 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor was capable of screening bioactive compound from complex system, providing an effective methodology for high throughput screening.","Chen, Jin, Shayiranbieke, Zhao, Fan, Li, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2022.114632","20220208","5-HT(1A) receptor; Affinity chromatography; G protein-coupled receptor; Halo-tag; High-throughput screening; One-step immobilization","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26698,""
"Mental health of US undergraduate and graduate students before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences across sociodemographic groups","The purposes of this study were to assess differences between sociodemographic groups in student mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, to investigate whether the pandemic disproportionately affected certain groups, and to examine between-group differences in pandemic-related stressors. Data from Minnesota undergraduate and graduate students who completed an online survey in 2020 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2,067) were compared to data collected from students in 2018 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3,627). The survey assessed days of poor mental health, stress, stress management ability, days of adequate sleep, and pandemic-related stressors (2020 only). Multivariate analyses of variance assessed differences between study years (2020Ã‚Â vs. 2018), sociodemographic groups (gender, sexual orientation, race, disability, international student), and their interactions with study year in predicting mental health, and the sociodemographic groups in predicting pandemic stressors, among undergraduate and graduate students. Stress management ability decreased and sleep improved from 2018 to 2020. The sociodemographic variables most associated with poorer mental health were identifying as female, a sexual minority, or having a disability. Undergraduates reported poorer mental health than graduate students. Differences between sociodemographic groups were not larger during the pandemic, except among students with disabilities. All five sociodemographic variables were related to greater pandemic stressors in some domains.","Liu, Frazier, Porta, Lust","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114428","20220208","Gender differences; Mental health; People with disabilities; Race; college student health; sexual minorities; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26699,""
"Medicaid expansion and drug overdose mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions in the delivery of health services, which may have adversely affected access to substance use disorder (SUD) treatment services. Medicaid expansion has been previously associated with increased access to SUD services for low-income adults. Thus, the pandemic may have differentially impacted overdose mortality depending on expansion status. This study examined trends in overdose mortality nationally and by state Medicaid expansion status from 2013 to 2020. State-level data on overdose mortality were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's WONDER database for 2013-2020 (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 408 state-years). The primary outcomes were drug and opioid overdose deaths per 100,000 residents. The primary exposure was Medicaid expansion status as of January 1st, 2020. Difference-in-difference (DID) models were used to compare changes in outcomes between expansion and non-expansion states after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. experienced 91,799 drug overdose deaths in 2020, a 29.9% relative increase from 2019. Expansion states experienced an adjusted increase of 7.0 drug overdose deaths per 100,000 residents (95% CI 3.3, 10.7) and non-expansion states experienced an increase of 4.3 deaths (95% CI 1.5, 8.2) from 2019 to 2020. Similar trends were observed in opioid overdose deaths. In DID models, Medicaid expansion was not associated with changes in drug (0.9 deaths, 95% CI -2.0, 3.7) or opioid overdose deaths (0.8 deaths, 95% CI -1.8, 3.5). The increase in drug or opioid overdose deaths experienced during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic was similar in states with and without Medicaid expansion.","Auty, Griffith","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2022.109340","20220208","COVID-19; Medicaid; Opioid use disorder; Overdose mortality; Substance use disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26700,""
"The Experience of Older Adults Socially Distancing during the Early Stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals were asked to stay home and restrict outings to limit the spread of the virus. Physical isolation was particularly emphasized for older adults over the age of 60 who, because of their age and related medical conditions, were at increased risk of severe disease and death from the virus. This led to reduced spread of the virus but also to social and emotional health challenges for older adults. Protecting the physical health of older adults was of the utmost importance during the pandemic but supporting social and mental health must not be overlooked. This patient-oriented qualitative study involved 40 interviews with older adults, conducted in the early stages of the pandemic, followed by a thematic analysis. Three themes were derived from the findings: subverted life plan, emotional impacts, and creating a path forward. The findings from this study will help inform current physical and social distancing guidelines during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, findings indicate that social and emotional challenges with ongoing physical and social isolation must be taken into consideration for future pandemics.","Nelson, Ziefflie, Norton, Page, Unique, Mayer","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0714980821000581","20220208","COVID-19; aging; analyse thÃƒÂ©matique; isolation; isolement; older adults; personnes ÃƒÂ¢gÃƒÂ©es; santÃƒÂ© sociale et ÃƒÂ©motionnelle; social and emotional health; thematic analysis; vieillissement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26701,""
"Stop talking about it already! Co-ruminating and social media focused on COVID-19 was associated with heightened state anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived changes in health anxiety during Spring 2020","Social distancing presents a significant obstacle for relationships and threatens mental health. Identifying maladaptive, voluntary coping strategies may inform how to maintain interpersonal relationships and mental health during quarantine. Co-ruminating with peers on negative events, moods and fears has adjustment trade-offs of increasing depression and anxiety risk while also enhancing friendship quality. Similarly, social media use is associated with social benefits and risk to mental health. We extend prior research by examining whether co-ruminating on COVID-19, social media use, and social media use focused on COVID-19 during social isolation was associated with heightened depression and anxiety symptoms but also lower loneliness and higher social support during initial lockdown measures in the USA. Adults were recruited through social media (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°345) to complete self-report surveys on co-rumination, social media use, social distancing, social support from March-May 2020. During this cross-sectional assessment, in addition to completing surveys on current depressive symptoms and state and health anxiety, participants also provided retrospective report of their perceived health anxiety levels six months prior. Co-ruminating on COVID-19 with peers and greater time on social media focused on COVID-19 predicted perceived increases in health anxiety and were also associated with higher depressive symptoms and state anxiety, even after controlling for significant demographic predictors. Further, in the context of social distancing, both interaction strategies failed to confer social benefits. Results have direct implications for maintaining psychosocial health during social distancing restrictions. Adults may modify how they engage with peers by limiting COVID-19 content on social media and COVID-19 discussion.","Stone, Veksler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00734-7","20220208","COVID-19; Co-rumination; Health anxiety; Mental health; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26702,""
"Stay mindfully active during the coronavirus pandemic: a feasibility study of mHealth-delivered mindfulness yoga program for people with Parkinson's disease","Patients with long-term neurological conditions, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), are particularly vulnerable to the public health measures taken to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The inaccessibility of center-based rehabilitation further aggravated their motor dysfunctions as well as mental distress, leading to exacerbation of motor and non-motor symptoms, high healthcare utilization and worsened health-related quality of life (HRQOL). This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary effects of the mHealth-delivered home-based mindfulness yoga program on functional balance, motor symptoms, mental health and HRQOL in patients with PD. This prospective, single-arm, non-randomized feasibility study adopted a sequential explanatory mixed-method design. Adults (agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18) with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage I to III) who were able to stand unaided and walk with or without an assistive device were enrolled via convenience sampling. Home-based mindfulness yoga training were delivered via video-conferencing software (Zoom) in eight bi-weekly 90-min sessions. This current study measured functional balance, motor symptoms, perceived balance confidence, perceived freezing of gait symptoms, anxiety and depression, mindfulness and HRQOL using a tele-assessment approach at baseline and 1-week post-intervention. All participants were invited to attend qualitative individual interviews to explore their experience of using online mindfulness yoga program as a lifestyle intervention for PD rehabilitation. Among the ten patients, 80% completed the program with an adherence rate of 98.4%. All participants were able to learn and practice mindfulness yoga following the eight bi-weekly online mindfulness yoga training sessions, without any significant adverse events. Tele-assessment of outcomes were feasible and uneventful. Qualitative feedback revealed participants had a high preference of using the tele-rehabilitation approach to stay mindful and being active, both physically and socially, while confronting the changes brought by COVID-19 pandemic. The mHealth-delivered home-based mindfulness yoga intervention was feasible, safe, and well-accepted among people with PD to relieve the burden brought by COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should adopt a design with enhanced rigor, a comparison group, and enlarged sample size to evaluate the efficacy of the program in patients with long-term neurological conditions and/or physical impairments. We recommend a longer intervention duration of at least 8Ã‚Â weeks to enhance the psychophysiological effects.","Kwok, Lee, Choi, Chau, Auyeung","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12906-022-03519-y","20220208","Home-based; Mindfulness; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Physical exercise; Psychological support; Quality of life; Rehabilitation; Symptom management; Yoga; mHealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26703,""
"Outcomes in post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) at 6 months post-infection Part 1: Cognitive functioning","Long-term cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 have not been extensively studied. This study provides initial results on cognitive outcomes in Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).<b>Participants and Methods</b>: This study examined 53 consecutive outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19. Four participants were excluded due to performance validity test failure. All participants had positive COVID-19 tests, reported cognitive concerns, and completed neuropsychological tests to assess performance validity, attention/working memory, processing speed, memory, language, visual-spatial, executive functioning, motor, and emotional functioning. The sample was mostly white (89.8%), female (83.7%), and never hospitalized (69.4%) for COVID-19. Analyses indicated no mean scores in the Impaired range (&gt;2 standard deviations [SD] below normative mean) on objective cognitive testing and a low base rate of Impaired test scores. Higher (&gt;20%) base rates of Borderline performance (1-2 SDs below normative mean) were found on some measures. There was also evidence for frequently elevated mean scores on mood measures which correlated with some cognitive measures and the number of Borderline scores per participants. The results were noteworthy for infrequent Impaired scores, and significant correlations between cognition and mood/anxiety measures, but not between cognitive performance and premorbid vascular risk factors, psychiatric diagnoses, or COVID-19 disease severity. Results suggest that psychological distress was prominent in PASC and related to objective cognitive performance, but objective cognitive performance was unrelated to cognitive complaints. Other contributing factors may include fatigue/sleep issues. Neurologically based cognitive deficits were not suggested by the results.During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers and clinicians have gained considerable knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the COVID-19 illness. Research has implicated COVID-19 in a variety of neurological and psychiatric issues (Taquet etÃ‚Â al., 2021) including stroke, depression/anxiety, and more rarely intracranial hemorrhage and psychotic disorders. Further, various vascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have been associated with more severe COVID-19 symptoms (Bauer etÃ‚Â al., 2021; Luk etÃ‚Â al., 2021; Mishra etÃ‚Â al., 2020; Saxena etÃ‚Â al., 2021). Additionally, while many patients recover from COVID-19 in a few weeks, a substantial number continue to experience physical (e.g., fatigue, shortness of breath, cough, palpitations) and cognitive (e.g., ""brain fog"", concentration and memory complaints) symptoms for a considerable period (Raveendran etÃ‚Â al., 2021). It has also been suggested that patients themselves, via social media, contributed to reifying the phenomenon of ""Long COVID-19"" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC; Callard &amp; Perego, 2021). However, very limited research exists that directly investigates the cognitive sequelae of COVID-19 infection, particularly in the long term. The current study aims to address this limitation in the literature.","Whiteside, Basso, Naini, Porter, Holker, Waldron, Melnik, Niskanen, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2022.2030412","20220208","COVID-19; Long COVID-19; cognitive functioning; memory; psychological functioning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26704,""
"Sense of Alienation and Its Associations With Depressive Symptoms and Poor Sleep Quality in Older Adults Who Experienced the Lockdown in Wuhan, China, During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine the epidemiology of sense of alienation (SoA) and its associations with depressive symptoms and poor sleep quality (PSQ) in Chinese older adults who experienced lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a dearth of data on SoA in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Altogether, 543 community-dwelling older adults (50+ years) were recruited via the three-tier mental health network in Wuhan, China, and completed an online questionnaire in April 2020, the first month after the reopening of Wuhan. SoA, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality were measured by using the General Social Alienation Scale, Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale, and a single standardized question, respectively. The prevalence of SoA was 52.3% (95% confidence interval: 48.1-56.5%). Factors associated with higher levels of SoA were religious belief (ÃŽÂ² = 1.960, <i>P</i> = .024), monthly family income&lt;4000 RMB (ÃŽÂ² = 1.405, <i>P</i> = .022), unemployment (ÃŽÂ² = 1.217, <i>P</i> = .039), fair or poor physical health (ÃŽÂ² = 2.202, <i>P</i> = .002), never and sometimes receiving community support (ÃŽÂ² = 2.297, <i>P</i> &lt; .001 and ÃŽÂ² = 3.417, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), perceiving a low possibility of a cure for COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ² = 2.379, <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and affirmative and unsure fear of COVID-19 patients (ÃŽÂ² = 2.025, <i>P</i> = .007 and ÃŽÂ² = 1.101, <i>P</i> = .027). After adjusting for sociodemographic and pandemic-related variables, a one-SD increment in the SoA score was significantly associated with depressive symptoms (Odd Ratio [OR] = 5.59, <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and poor sleep quality (Odd Ratio = 2.00, <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Over half of the older adults who experienced lockdown felt alienated, and SoA was independently associated with their depressive symptoms and PSQ. Efforts are warranted to address SoA in older adults who experienced lockdown during the pandemic.","Chen, Chen, Zhong","https://doi.org/10.1177/08919887221078564","20220208","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; elderly; sense of alienation; sleep quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26705,""

"Update on the Mental Health Crisis in Academia: Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Early Career Researchersâ€™ Mental Health and Satisfaction with PhD training","In recent years, academia has been facing a mental health crisis affecting especially early career researchers (ECRs). Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has posed an unprecedented burden for the mental health of many individuals. In this study we conducted an online survey aiming to investigate how ECRs, specifically doctoral students, evaluate their mental health status and satisfaction with their PhD training during and, retrospectively, before the pandemic. The survey took place in the beginning of 2021 in Germany, during which time pandemic-related restrictions and a soft lock-down were in place. Our final sample comprised 222 mostly empirically working doctoral researchers in an international and diverse science context of the wider Berlin area. Our results show that satisfaction with the PhD training and overall well-being decreased during the pandemic, as compared to the self-reported retrospective evaluations of these aspects before the onset of the pandemic. Additionally, more than a fifth of the sample was found to show clinically meaningful levels of depressive symptoms. Almost 25% experienced severe loneliness and the whole sample exhibited high levels of personal and work-related burnout. Finally, we explored predictors of the quantified levels of depression, anxiety, and burnout. The most prominent predictor for poor mental health was low satisfaction with PhD training, strongly suggesting a link between the doctoral work of ECRs and their mental health. Females vs. males as well as ECRs in individual PhD trainings vs. structured PhD programs reported higher symptoms of burnout. Taken together, our study replicates previous findings of poor mental health in ECRs and shows that problems related to PhD training increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we conclude that systematic adjustments in academia are required to improve the mental health of ECRs.","Sandra Naumann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01E3-5B7-2C2","20220208","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; covid-19; phd; early career researcher; mental health","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-09","",26708,""
