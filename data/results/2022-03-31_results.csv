"Unravelling the link between sleep and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The emergence of COVID-19 brought unparalleled changes in peoples lifestyle, including sleep. We aimed to assess the bidirectional association between sleep quality and mental health and describe how sleep and mental health were affected in Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic (between June 2020 and September 2021). Methods: Data were obtained from the Omtanke2020 study. Participants who completed the baseline survey and 8 monthly follow-up surveys were included (N=9035). We described the distribution of sleep and mental health in the different Swedish regions using maps and over the study period with longitudinal graphs adjusting for sex, age, recruitment type (self-recruitment or invitation), and COVID-19 status. The inner relationships between mental health, sleep and covid infection were described through relative importance networks. Finally, we modelled how mental health affects sleep and vice versa using generalized estimating equations with different adjustments. Results: Seasonal and north-south regional variations were found in sleep and mental health outcomes at baseline and attenuated over time. The seasonal variation of sleep and mental health correlated moderately with the incidence rate of COVID-19 in the sample. Networks indicate that the relationship between COVID-19 incidence and mental health varies over time. We observed a bidirectional relationship between sleep quality and quantity at baseline and mental health at follow-up and vice versa. Conclusion: Sleep quality and quantity at baseline was associated with adverse symptom trajectories of mental health at follow-up, and vice versa, during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also a weak relationship between COVID-19 incidence, sleep, and mental health.","Juan Gonzalez-Hijon; Anna K KÃ¤hler; Emma M Frans; Unnur Anna ValdimarsdÃ³ttir; Patrick F Sullivan; Fang Fang; AnikÃ³ Lovik","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.28.22273027","20220330","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29299,""
"Substance use and associated factors among Adolescents during the Covid-19 pandemic in Eastern Ethiopia: A cross-sectional study","Introduction: The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been dramatic and wide-reaching, affecting many more than those who become ill, including reports of increased substance use among adolescents may be due to various restrictions of social life that disrupted adolescents daily lives. However, up to now, no data is showing the extent of substance use among adolescents in the study area. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of substance use and associated factors during the Covid-19 pandemic among school adolescents of west hararghe, Eastern Ethiopia to guide possible intervention and public policy. Methods: A School-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from 10 to 30, October 2021. A multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 788 students from ten public secondary schools in the West Hararge zone, Eastern Ethiopia. The data were collected using a self-administered pre-tested semi-structured questionnaire. Data was entered into Epidata version 3.1 and then exported to SPSS version 26 software for further analysis. Descriptive analysis was done. Multi variables binary logistic regression was done and a p-value less than 0.05 were used to declare statistical significance. Results : In this study, the response rate of 98.46% were complete fill the questionnaires. More than 1 in 2 of the adolescent students were self-reported substances (alcohol, khat (Catha edulis) and/or cigarette) users (prevalence = 58.6%) during the Covid-19 pandemic. Specifically, chewing khat (Catha edulis) (57.87%), followed by alcohol user (21.73%), Cigarette smoking (14.85%) and, hashish consumption (5.54%).  Age of students, family history of drinking alcohol, availability of substances were factors positively associated with substance use. On the other hand, family management is negatively associated with substance use. Conclusions: The prevalence of substance users among adolescents was dramatically increased during the covid-19 pandemic in the west hararghe zone, Ethiopia. Hence, the authors hoped that these findings provide preliminary insights for refining mental health and addiction policies that are targeted at adolescent and their parents in these settings and guidance for further research.","Ebisa Zerihun; kenasa Tesama","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.29.22273151","20220330","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29300,""
"Labor market position and depression during the COVID-19 epidemic among young adults (18 to 30 years): a nationally representative study in France","Objective: To examine the relationship between young adults labor force participation and depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, Participants: Data come from the nationally-representative EPICOV cohort study set up in France, and were collected in 2020 and 2021 (3 waves of online or telephone interviews) among 2217 participants aged 18-30 years. Participants with prior mental health disorder (n=50) were excluded from the statistical analyses. Results: Using Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) models controlled for participant socio-demographic and health characteristics and weighted to be nationally-representative, we found that compared to young adults who were employed, those who were studying or unemployed were significantly more likely to experience depression assessed using the PHQ-9 (multivariate ORs respectively: OR: 1.29, 95% CI 1.05-1.60 and OR: 1.50, 1.13-1.99). Stratifying the analyses by age, we observed than unemployment was more strongly associated with depression among participants 25-30 years than among those who were 18-24 years (multivariate ORs respectively 1.78, 95% CI 1.17-2.71 and 1.41, 95% CI 0.96-2.09). Being out of the labor force was, to the contrary, more significantly associated with depression among participants 18-24 years (multivariate OR: 1.71, 95% CI 1.04-2.82, vs. 1.00, 95% CI 0.53-1.87 among participants 25-30 years). Stratifying the analyses by sex, we found no significant differences in the relationships between labor market characteristics and depression (compared to participants who were employed, multivariate ORs associated with being a student: men: 1.33, 95% CI 1.01-1.76; women: 1.19, 95% CI 0.85-1.67, multivariate ORs associated with being unemployed: men: 1.60, 95% CI 1.04-2.45; women: 1.47, 95% CI 1.01-2.15). Conclusions and relevance: Our study shows that in addition to students, young adults who are unemployed also experience elevated levels of depression in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. These two groups should be the focus of specific attention in terms of prevention and mental health treatment. Supporting employment could also be a propitious way of reducing the burden of the Covid-19 pandemic on the mental health of young adults.","Maria Melchior; Aline-Marie Florence; Camille Davisse-Paturet; Bruno Falissard; Cedric Galera; Jean-Baptiste Hazo; Cecile Vuillermoz; Josiane WARSZAWSKI; Fallou Dione; Alexandra Rouquette","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.25.22272948","20220330","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29301,""
"Healthcare workers perceptions and medically approved COVID-19 infection risk: understanding the mental health dimension of the pandemic A German hospital case study","Introduction. This study analyses how healthcare workers (HCWs) perceived risks, protection and preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to medically approved risks and organisational measures. The aim is to explore blind spots of pandemic protection and make mental health needs of HCWs visible. Methods. We have chosen an optimal-case scenario of a high-income country with a well-resourced hospital sector and low HCW infection rate at the organisational level to explore governance gaps in HCW protection. A German multi-method hospital study at Hannover Medical School served as empirical case; document analysis, expert information and survey data (n=1163) were collected as part of a clinical study into SARS-CoV-2 serology testing during the second wave of the pandemic (November 2020-February 2021). Selected survey items included perceptions of risks, protection and preventive measures. Descriptive statistical analysis and regression were undertaken for gender, profession and COVID-19 patient care. Results. The results reveal a low risk of 1% medically approved infections among participants, but a much higher mean personal risk estimate of 15%. The majority (68.4%) expressed some to very strong fear of acquiring infection at the workplace. Individual protective behaviour and compliance with protective workplace measures were estimated as very high. Yet only about half of the respondents felt strongly protected by the employer; 12% even perceived no or little protection. Gender and contact with COVID-19 patients had no significant effect on the estimations of infection risks and protective workplace behaviour, but nursing was correlated with higher levels of personal risk estimations and fear of infection. Conclusions. A strong mismatch between low medically approved risk and personal risk perceptions of HCWs brings stressors and threats into view, that may be preventable through better information and risk communication and through investment in mental health and inclusion in pandemic preparedness plans.","Ellen Kuhlmann; Georg Behrens; Anne Cossmann; Stefanie Homann; Christine Happle; Alexandra Dopfer-Jablonka","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.03.28.22273029","20220330","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29302,""
"Weathering the storm alone or together: Examining the impact of COVID-19 on sole and partnered working mothers","Sole employed mothers and their families face numerous challenges. Yet, the unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic may be adding additional risk to the already precarious day-to-day reality of this population. Thus, we examine the implications of this crisis for the mental health and job-related well-being of both sole and partnered working mothers. Participants were 206 mothers who continued to work during the pandemic. A moderated mediation model was analyzed. Work-family conflict (WFC) during the pandemic differentially related to mothers' parenting stress, based on romantic partnership status; when mothers were sole parents, the relationship between WFC and parenting stress was exacerbated. Moreover, this stress mediated the relationship between WFC and both poor mental health and decreased work engagement for sole employed mothers. Findings broaden our understanding of the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for sole and partnered employed mothers, and how this crisis may be increasing disparities between working sole-parent and dual-partner families.","Dionisi, Smith, DuprÃƒÂ©","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22829","20220330","maternal behavior; parenting; single parent; work engagement; work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29303,""
"Loneliness during COVID-19: Development and influencing factors","In early pandemic waves, when vaccination against COVID-19 was not yet an option, distancing and reduced social contact were the most effective measures to slow down the pandemic. Changes in frequency and forms of social contact have reduced the spread of the COVID-19 virus and thus saved lives, yet there is increasing evidence for negative side effects such as mental health issues. In the present study, we investigate the development of loneliness and its predictors to examine the role of changes in social networks due to social distancing and other COVID-19-related life changes. A total of 737 participants (age range = 18-81 years) completed an online survey in three waves during the last quarter of 2020 at one-month intervals. Latent growth and multilevel modeling revealed that emotional loneliness increased over time, while social loneliness remained stable. Moreover, socially lonely individuals were likely to also develop emotional loneliness over time. Increased social distancing and sanitary measures were accompanied by decreased social interactions and loss of individuals considered SOS contacts and confidants. Changes in specific social network indicators were differentially associated with changes in emotional vs social loneliness: Loss of friends considered confidants was associated with increasing emotional loneliness, whereas loss of friends considered SOS contacts and reduced overall social interactions were related to increasing social loneliness. Lastly, individuals with more family-and-friend SOS contacts, more friends as confidants and an overall higher number of social interactions were more protected from feeling socially or emotionally lonely. Study findings enhance the understanding of underlying mechanisms differentially contributing to social and emotional loneliness and offer practical suggestions to reduce mental-health side effects of social distancing.","Lampraki, Hoffman, Roquet, Jopp","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0265900","20220330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29304,""
"Strength-based parenting and stress-related growth in adolescents: Exploring the role of positive reappraisal, school belonging, and emotional processing during the pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the way families live, interact, and connect with others, resulting in higher levels of stress for many teenagers who struggle with the ongoing uncertainty and disrupted school and family life. The current study examined the psychosocial factors that influence the capacity of adolescents to grow through the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 404 secondary school students ranging in age from 11 to 18 (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°14.75, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.59; 50.2% female, 46.8% male, and 3% non-/other gendered or declined to answer) from an independent high school in Australia. Data were collected from a battery of questionnaires that assessed strength-based parenting (SBP) and the effect of three psychosocial factors (positive reappraisal, emotional processing, and school belonging) on stress-related growth. Structural equation modeling showed that (SBP) was significantly associated with stress-related growth (SRG). Positive reappraisal and emotional processing were also positively and significantly associated with SRGÃ‚Â and mediated the effect of SBPÃ‚Â on SRG. Moreover, school belonging was positively linked to positive coping, emotional processing, and SRG, as well as mediating the association of SBP with positive reappraisal, emotional processing, and SRG in adolescents during the pandemic. The results show that teenagers can experience SRG during the COVID-19 pandemic, and adolescents adapting by engaging in constructive coping responses such as positive reappraisal and emotional processing is positively related to SRG.","Allen, Waters, Arslan, Prentice","https://doi.org/10.1002/jad.12016","20220330","COVID-19; positive education; strengths; stress-related growth; student wellbeing; youth mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29305,""
"Changes in community and hospital-based health care use during the COVID-19 pandemic for adults with and without intellectual and developmental disabilities","Due to the functional, cognitive and communication impairments associated with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities (IDD), adaptations to service delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may impact people with IDD differently than others. For community and hospital-based services, this study describes the proportion of adults with and without IDD who used health care in the year pre-COVID-19 and the first year of the pandemic. This retrospective cohort study used linked health administrative databases to identify adults aged 18-105Ã‚Â years with and without IDD using unique encoded identifiers. Counts and proportions of adults who used health care services were reported for the pre-COVID-19 year (16 March 2019 to 14 March 2020) and the first COVID-19 year (15 March 2020 to 15 March 2021). Across services, the proportion of adults who used services was lower during the first COVID-19 year compared with the year prior, except for virtual physician visits that increased markedly for people with and without IDD. While the proportion of adults who used services was higher for those with IDD compared with those without IDD for both years, differences were greatest for mental health emergency visits and hospitalisations; adults with IDD were 6.3 to 10.9 times more likely to use these services than others with no IDD during the pandemic. During the first COVID-19 year in Ontario, Canada, service use decreased for all service types, except for virtual physician visits. In both years, adults with IDD remained more likely to use services than other adults, with the largest differences in use of mental health hospitalisations and mental health emergency department visits.","Durbin, Balogh, Lin, Palma, Plumptre, Lunsky","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12929","20220330","COVID-19; hospitalisations; intellectual and developmental disabilities; physician visits; service use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29306,""
"Depression Symptoms and Olfactory-related Quality of Life","Patients with olfactory dysfunction (OD) frequently report symptoms of depression. The objective of this study was to determine how clinical characteristics and olfactory-related quality of life (QoL) measures associate with the likelihood for major depressive disorders (MDDs). A total of 192 OD patients were included. Olfactory function was measured using all three subtests of the Sniffn' Sticks test. Olfactory-related quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the Questionnaires of Olfactory Dysfunction (QOD)-negative (NS) and -positive statement (PS). The likelihood for MDD was assessed using the Patients Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2). Demographics and disease-specific variables (etiology and duration of OD) were collected. Univariate and multivariable analyses were used to associate disease-specific variables and the QOD with the outcome of the PHQ-2. Additionally, the predictive ability of the QOD-NS to predict depressive symptoms was calculated. In univariate analysis, COVID-19 related smell loss, the QOD-NS, and the QOD-PS were significantly associated with the PHQ-2. In multivariable analyses adjusting for QoL measures, the QOD-NS (ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.532, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and sinonasal OD (compared with postinfectious OD) were significantly associated with the PHQ-2 (ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.146, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.047). When omitting QoL measures from multivariable analyses, only COVID-19 related OD (compared with postinfectious OD) was significantly associated with the PHQ-2 (ÃƒÅ¸Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.287, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.009). A QOD-NS scoreÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°20.5 had 70.13% sensitivity and 76.32% specificity for detecting symptoms of depression. Our results suggest that COVID-19 related OD might be associated with a higher likelihood for MDD. Furthermore, we showed that the QOD-NS score might be helpful to predict symptoms of depression in OD patients. 4 Laryngoscope, 2022.","Liu, Prem, Sharma, Kaiser, Besser, Mueller","https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.30122","20220330","PROM; anosmia; depression; hyposmia; olfactory dysfunction; quality of life; smell loss","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29307,""
"The health-related quality of life in patients with post-COVID-19 after hospitalization: a systematic review","Symptoms in post-COVID-19 patients who require hospitalization can persist for months, significantly affecting their health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Thus, the present study aimed to discuss the main findings regarding HRQoL in post-COVID-19 patients who required hospitalization. An electronic search was performed in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, LILACS, and Scopus databases, without date and language restrictions, until July 2021. Twenty-four articles were included in the analysis. It seems that HRQoL partially improved soon after hospital discharge, although the negative impact on HRQoL may persist for months. The physical and mental aspects are affected because patients report pain, discomfort, anxiety, and depression. The HRQoL of COVID-19 infected patients was worse than that of uninfected patients. Additionally, HRQoL seemed worse in patients admitted to the intensive care unit than in those who remained in the ward. Improvements in HRQoL after hospital discharge are independent of imaging improvement, and there seems to be no association between HRQoL after hospital discharge and disease severity on hospital admission. Many factors have been identified as determinants of HRQoL, with women and advanced age being the most related to worse HRQOL, followed by the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation and the need for intensive care. Other factors included the presence and number of comorbidities, lower forced vital capacity, high body mass index, smoking history, undergraduate education, and unemployment. In conclusion, these findings may aid in clinical management and should be considered in the aftercare of patients.","Figueiredo, Silva, Tsopanoglou, Vitorino, Oliveira, Silva, Luz, ÃƒÂvila, Oliveira, Lacerda, MendonÃƒÂ§a, Lima, Mediano, Figueiredo, Rocha, Costa","https://doi.org/10.1590/0037-8682-0741-2021","20220330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29308,""
"Lower urinary tract symptoms and mental health during COVID-19 pandemic","Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a group of RNA viruses involved in several human diseases affecting respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological systems. COVID-19 was identified in 2020 and was named SARS-CoV-2. To limit worldwide contagion, many countries instituted a lockdown, which conducted to disruption of routine life. In fact, pandemic was associated with several stresses among population, such as loss of employment, deaths of family members, friends, or colleagues, financial insecurity, and isolation. This led to long-lasting psychosocial effects as anxiety and depression, increasing the prevalence of stress and traumarelated disorders in the population. The aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between lower urinary tracts symptoms (LUTS) and stress/depressive symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic. An anonymous cross-sectional webbased survey (comprehending anthropometric data, education level, occupation status, smoking and alcohol habits, current therapies, quarantine and COVID-19 infection status) was conducted from March to May 2020 in Italy. LUTS were examined through National Institute of Health-Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) and Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI). Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was utilized to evaluate depressive and anxiety symptoms. Non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H Test was used for statistical analysis. A total of 356 out of 461 subjects fully completed the survey, with a response rate of 77.2%. Data showed that subjects involved in economic difficulties, quarantine measures or with increased HDRS reported a significative statistic worsened urinary symptoms (H(3) = 11.731, p = 0.008), quality of life, (H(3) = 10.301, p = 0.016), total NIH-CPSI/GUPI score (H(3) = 42.150, p = 0.000), and quality of life (H(3) = 48.638, p = 0.000). COVID-19 pandemic provoked several alterations in everyday life. Although general lockdown, quarantine and social distancing have been necessary to prevent virus spreading, this had long term effects on all population in terms of mental and physical health. NIH-CPSI and GUPI scores increased linearly with stress and anxiety levels measured at HDRS, confirming worse LUTS in subjects who suffered anxiety and stress from COVID-19 pandemic.","Barone, De Luca, Napolitano, Reccia, Crocetto, Creta, Vitale, Caputo, Martino, Cirillo, Fusco, Trivellato, Celentano, La Rocca, Prezioso, Longo","https://doi.org/10.4081/aiua.2022.1.46","20220330","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29309,""
"The effects of COVID-19 stressors and family life on anxiety and depression one-year into the COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Coronavirus (COVID-19)-related stressors and family health on adult anxiety and depressive symptoms 1Ã‚Â year into the pandemic. The sample consisted of 442 adults living in the United States who were recruited via Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results indicated that compared to a sample 1Ã‚Â month into the pandemic, participants in the current sample reported worse family health and increases in both positive and negative perceptions of the pandemic on family life and routines. COVID-19Ã‚Â stressors and perceived negative effects of the pandemic on family life increased the odds for moderate-to-severe depression and anxiety while having more family health resources decreased the odds for depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants reported lower odds for worse depression and anxiety since the beginning of the pandemic when they reported more positive family meaning due to the pandemic. The results suggest a need to consider the impact of family life on mental health in pandemics and other disasters.

"Investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer clinicians' communication about sexual health","We assessed breast cancer clinicians' perspectives on how the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telehealth affected their clinical communication about sexual heath. Breast cancer clinicians participating in a sexual health communication intervention study (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29; 76% female; 66% oncologists; 34% advanced practice clinicians) completed an online survey. Data analysis consisted of descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. All clinicians were using telehealth, with most (66%) using it for up to half of their clinic appointments. Although only 14% of clinicians reported having shorter clinic visits, 28% reported having less time to discuss sexual health; 69% reported no change; and 3% said they had more time. Forty-one percent reported sexual health was less of a priority; 55% reported no change; and 3% said it was more of a priority. Thirty-five percent reported telehealth was less conducive to discussing sexual health; 59% reported no change; and 7% reported more conducive. Qualitative analysis revealed key issues underlying the perceived impact of the pandemic on discussions of sexual health including heightened clinician discomfort discussing such issues via telehealth, the less personal nature and privacy issues in telehealth visits, increased concerns about risk of COVID-19 infection and other health concerns (e.g., missing recurrence, mental health) taking priority, and clinician-perceived patient factors (e.g., discomfort, decreased priority) in discussing sexual concerns. Pandemic-related changes in breast cancer clinicians' practice could be exacerbating challenges to discussing sexual health. Methods for integrating sexual health into cancer care are needed, regardless of the mode of delivery.","Reese, El-Jawahri, Sorice, Cruz, Bober, Daly, Zimmaro, Beach, Wittenberg, Wolff, Handorf, Lepore","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-022-07003-8","20220330","Breast neoplasms; COVID-19; Health communication; Sexual health; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29311,""

"Weight stigma in the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review","Weight stigma is a phenomenon associated with adverse behavioural and psychological consequences. Although experts suggest that its increase during the COVID-19 pandemic may be associated with worse health outcomes for people with obesity, a thorough analysis of the main findings and gaps is still needed when relating to this subject. We aim to answer three questions: (1) How does weight stigma manifest in the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) How can weight stigma affect people with overweight or obesity in times of COVID-19? (3) What are the perceptions and experiences of weight stigma during the pandemic in individuals who experience overweight or obesity? We conducted a scoping review of studies addressing weight stigma and the COVID-19 pandemic in electronic databases (Medline/PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, PsycInfo, BVS/Lilacs, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and OpenGrey) published until 10th August 2021. All relevant studies were reviewed in full by two researchers. In addition, a narrative synthesis of the data was performed. The results included 35 studies out of 8,090 records and identified 13 original research publications, 14 text and opinion papers, and 6 narrative reviews. The results revealed the presence of weight stigma in the media, healthcare settings, interpersonal relationships, and public campaigns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The evidence of increasing weight stigma in the COVID-19 outbreak is limited, though. Many weight discrimination consequences were described during this time, such as impairment in accessing healthcare, worst COVID-19 outcomes, and maladaptive eating. However, only maladaptive behaviours and decline in mental health outcomes were demonstrated empirically in all age groups. This effect occurred regardless of body mass index, but people with high body weight were more likely to experience weight stigma. For some people with obesity, weight stigma in the pandemic has made activities of daily routine difficult. The results suggest that weight stigma in the COVID-19 pandemic occurs in several settings; moreover, although weight discrimination impacts mental health, whether before or during the pandemic, this influence between the pandemic and pre-pandemic scenario is still unclear. Therefore, more research is required in this field while the pandemic lasts, especially with people with obesity. Overall, people with overweight or obesity are more vulnerable to weight stigma than individuals without overweight. In addition, weight stigma refers to discrimination or prejudice based on a person's weight and relates to several consequences, for instance, poor healthcare treatment and mental health problems. In the COVID-19 outbreak, these weight stigma effects tend to become even more critical because they may be associated with unfavourable COVID-19 outcomes and eating disorder risks. Thus, it is crucial to investigate how weight stigma occurs during the pandemic and its impact on health, mainly for the most affected people. We investigated 35 studies published between 2019 and 2021 to map and explore how weight stigma was manifested and the related consequences for people with overweight or obesity in the COVID-19 pandemic. Only about a third of them were quantitative or qualitative, limiting the evidence of weight stigma in the COVID-19 context. The available evidence suggests that weight stigma manifests in several settings such as media, healthcare, public campaigns, and is more common in people with excess weight. However, weight discrimination experiences before or during the pandemic were associated with adverse psychological and behavioural consequences across all age groups, regardless of body weight. For some people with obesity, for instance, weight stigma made it difficult to accomplish their activities of daily routine. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether weight stigma has increased in the pandemic, thus, more studies are required, especially about people with overweight or obesity.","de MacÃƒÂªdo, Nepomuceno, Dos Santos, Queiroz, Pereira, Leal, Santos, Nascimento, Martins, de Santana","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00563-4","20220330","Feeding and eating disorders; Quarantine; Weight prejudice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29313,""
"The perceived effects of COVID-19 pandemic on female genital mutilation/cutting and child or forced marriages in Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Senegal","The effects of COVID-19 on harmful traditional practices such Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C) and Child or Forced Marriages (CFM) have not been well documented. We examined respondents' perceptions on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected FGM/C and CFM in Kenya, Uganda, Senegal, and Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study design with a mixed methods approach was used. Data collection on participants' perceptions on the effects of COVID-19 on FGM/C and CFM took place between October-December 2020. Household surveys targeting women and men aged 15-49 years in Kenya (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°312), Uganda (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°278), Ethiopia (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°251), and Senegal (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°208) were conducted. Thirty-eight key informant interviews with programme implementers and policymakers were carried out in Kenya (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17), Uganda (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9), Ethiopia (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8), and Senegal (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°4). In Kenya, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the increase in both FGM/C and CFM cases. Minimal increase of FGM/C cases was reported in Uganda and a significant increase in CFM cases. In Ethiopia, the COVID-19 pandemic had a limited perceived effect on changes in FGM/C and CFM. In Senegal, there were minimal perceived effects of COVID-19 on the number of FGM/C and CFM cases. The pandemic negatively affected implementation of interventions by the justice and legal system, the health system, and civil societies. The pandemic has had varied perceived effects on FGM/C and CFM across the four countries. Generally, the pandemic has negatively affected implementation of interventions by the various sectors that are responsible for preventing and responding to FGM/C and CFM. This calls for innovative approaches in intervening in the various communities to ensure that women and girls at risk of FGM/C and CFM or in need of services are reached during the pandemic. Evidence on how effective alternative approaches such as the use of call centres, radio talk shows and the use of local champions as part of risk communication in preventing and responding to FGM/C and CFM amid COVID-19 is urgently required.","Esho, Matanda, Abuya, Abebe, Hailu, Camara, Mouhammed, Kapsandui, Kamanzi, Wabwire, Kagurusi, Nankanja, Gitimu, Kawai, Kogada, Ondigo, Osur","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13043-w","20220330","COVID-19; Child or forced marriage; Female genital mutilation/cutting; Perceived effects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29314,""
"The UK stand together trial: protocol for a multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of KiVa to reduce bullying in primary schools","Reducing bullying is a public health priority. KiVa, a school-based anti-bullying programme, is effective in reducing bullying in Finland and requires rigorous testing in other countries, including the UK. This trial aims to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of KiVa in reducing child reported bullying in UK schools compared to usual practice. The trial is currently on-going. Recruitment commenced in October 2019, however due to COVID-19 pandemic and resulting school closures was re-started in October 2020. Design: Two-arm pragmatic multicentre cluster randomised controlled trial with an embedded process and cost-effectiveness evaluation. 116 primary schools from four areas; North Wales, West Midlands, South East and South West England. Outcomes will be assessed at student level (ages 7-11Ã¢â‚¬â€°years; nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â approximately 13,000 students). KiVa is a whole school programme with universal actions that places a strong emphasis on changing bystander behaviour alongside indicated actions that provide consistent strategies for dealing with incidents of bullying. KiVa will be implemented over one academic year. Usual practice.

"Relationship Between Physical Activity, Parental Psychological Control, Basic Psychological Needs, Anxiety, and Mental Health in Chinese Engineering College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The issue of mental health among college students is of increasing concern during the COVID-19 outbreak. Since course characteristics of engineering college students determine the particularities of their mental health, the specific objectives of this study were: (1) to analyze the relationship between physical activity, parental psychological control, basic psychological needs, anxiety, and mental health in Chinese engineering college students during COVID-19 pandemic; and (2) to examine the mediation effect of anxiety between the relationship of basic psychological needs and mental health. A cross-sectional study was conducted among several universities in Shandong Province, China. We randomly selected 254 Chinese engineering college students from these colleges. Participants who were given questionnaires completed the Physical Activity Rating Scale (PARS-3), Basic Needs Satisfaction in General Scale (BNSG-S), Parental psychological control Questionnaire, the Beck anxiety inventory (BAI), and the Kessler 10 (K10) scale. The mediation model was conducted to assess the mediation effect of anxiety between the relationship of basic psychological needs and mental health. Among 254 Chinese college students majoring in engineering, the results showed that their mental health was in the mid-level range. Besides, physical activity and basic psychological needs is positively correlated with mental health, respectively, while parental psychological control is not correlated with mental health. Anxiety is negatively associated with mental health. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety played a mediation role in the relationship between basic psychological needs and mental health. In conclusion, mental health of Chinese engineering college students deserves extensive attention during the COVID-19 pandemic. Proper intervention on physical activity, basic psychological needs, and anxiety may be beneficial to improve their mental health. In addition, meeting basic psychological needs is beneficial to reduce anxiety and improve mental health further.","Liu, Li, Ren, Zhu, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.802477","20220330","anxiety; basic psychological needs; mental health; parental psychological control; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29316,""
"Lessons from experiences of accessing healthcare during the pandemic for remobilizing rheumatology services: a national mixed methods study","To understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on access to healthcare services for patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Three established cohorts that included individuals with axial SpA, psoriatic arthritis and MSK pain completed a questionnaire between July and December 2020. In parallel, a subset of individuals participated in semistructured interviews. A total of 1054 people (45% female, median age 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) were included in the quantitative analyses. Qualitative data included 447 free-text questionnaire responses and 23 interviews. A total of 57% of respondents had tried to access care since the start of the UK national lockdown. More than a quarter reported being unable to book any type of healthcare appointment. General practice appointments were less likely to be delayed or cancelled compared with hospital appointments. Younger age, unemployment/health-related retirement, DMARD therapy, anxiety or depression and being extremely clinically vulnerable were associated with a greater likelihood of attempting to access healthcare. People not in work, those reporting anxiety or depression and poorer quality of life were less likely to be satisfied with remotely delivered healthcare. Participants valued clear, timely and transparent care pathways across primary care and specialist services. While remote consultations were convenient for some, in-person appointments enabled physical assessment and facilitated the development and maintenance of clinical relationships with care providers. We identified patient factors that predict access to and satisfaction with care and aspects of care that patients value. This is important to inform remobilisation of rheumatology services to better meet the needs of patients.","Morton, Stelfox, Beasley, Jones, Macfarlane, Murchie, Paton, Hollick","https://doi.org/10.1093/rap/rkac013","20220330","COVID-19; PsA; axial spondyloarthritis; healthcare; pain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29317,""
"Pregnant women's coping strategies, participation roles and social support in the online community during the COVID-19","Pregnant women are experiencing enormous physical changes and suffering pregnancy-related losses, which may lead to depression symptoms during pregnancy. Given that the onslaught of COVID-19 had exacerbated pregnant women's anxiety because of disruptions in antenatal care and concerns regarding safe delivery, it is worth exploring how they obtain social support to cope with stress during COVID-19. Although many works have explored the impact of coping resources that people have on coping strategies, few studies have been done on the relationship between people's coping strategies and their acquisition of coping resources such as social support. To fill this gap, based on the stress and coping theory (SCT) and social penetration theory (SPT), this study investigates the impacts of pregnant women's different coping strategies on the acquisition of social support and the moderating role of the adverse impacts of COVID-19 and their online participation roles (support providers vs. support seekers) using the data of 814 pregnant women's online behavior from a parenting community in China. Our study indicates that both women's superficial level disclosure and personal level disclosure positively affect online social support received. Moreover, self-disclosure about the adverse impacts of COVID-19 negatively moderates the relationship between personal level disclosure and social support received. Participation role positively moderates the relationship between personal level disclosure and social support received, but negatively moderates the relationship between superficial level disclosure and social support received. This paper makes theoretical contributions to the literature of SCT, SPT and the literature about social support in online communities.","Lei, Wu, Ye","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2022.102932","20220330","Online social networks; Pregnant women; Self-disclosure; Social penetration theory; Social support; Stress and coping theory","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29318,""
"Acute symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 positive adolescents aged 15-18 years - Results from a Danish national cross-sectional survey study","The purpose of this study was to investigate prevalence of self-reported symptom burden during the acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated factors including sex differences. All Danish adolescents aged 15-18 years with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection between January 2020 and July 2021 were invited to participate. A survey covered the initial four weeks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and included questions regarding 17 symptoms associated with acute COVID-19, symptom burden and medical history. Statistical analyses included descriptive statistics and logistic regression. A total of 24,315 adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection were invited and 6630 (27.3%) completed the questionnaire. The median age was 17.6 years, and 58.4% (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3873) were female. No symptoms were reported by 33.8% (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2241), mild perceived symptom burden by 57.2%(<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 3775), and severe symptom burden by 9.0 % (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 594). Two thirds (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 2999) of the symptomatic participants reported a symptom duration of 1-10 days.

"Impacts of Stress Response and Negative Emotion on Mental Health of College Students During the COVID-19 Outbreak","In this study, we aimed to explore the influences of stress responses and negative emotion on mental health of college students during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China. A nationally representative sample of 1,351 college students, aged 18-23 years, took part in an online survey during the COVID-19 outbreak. The ANOVA, correlation coefficients, structural equation modeling (path analysis), and other statistical analysis methods were used for data analysis. (1) The Chinese college students' epidemic panic and cognitive evaluation were found to be moderate (3.73 Ã‚Â± 0.74, 3.76 Ã‚Â± 0.62), while their defensive response was higher (4.61 Ã‚Â± 0.55). Their mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak was found to be good (3.75 Ã‚Â± 0.76). (2) The quality of their mental health was significantly and negatively associated with epidemic panic, and the quality of their mental health was significantly and positively associated with defensive response. (3) The quality of their mental health was significantly and negatively associated with negative emotion. (4) College students' epidemic panic and defensive response to the COVID-19 had a directly predictive effect on their mental health. College students' negative emotion played a partial mediating role in the relationship between epidemic panic and mental health. College students' negative emotion played a complete mediating role in the relationship between cognitive appraisal and mental health.","Xu, Huang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.784661","20220330","COVID-19; epidemic panic; epidemic stress response; mental health; negative emotion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29320,""
"Longitudinal Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Older Adults' Wellbeing","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major stressful life event. This pandemic is causing significant changes in older adults' daily life affecting their physical and mental health. Psychological wellbeing is a protective variable when facing adverse circumstances, like the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on older adults' psychological wellbeing (personal growth and purpose in life) over time. One hundred ninety-two people over 60 years old participated in a longitudinal study. Data were collected in three time points: during the lockdown on March 2020, when the lockdown finished (4 months after baseline), and during the third wave (10 months after baseline). We used latent growth curve models to assess the linear longitudinal trajectories of psychological wellbeing. Older adults did not show worse psychological wellbeing over time. Age has a positive impact on purpose in life. Furthermore, being a male, worrying about adverse effects of COVID-19, family functioning, resilience, personal growth, and acceptance associated with purpose in life. These results suggest that despite the difficult circumstances experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have used protective variables for their psychological wellbeing.","LÃƒÂ³pez, PÃƒÂ©rez-Rojo, Noriega, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Huertas, Velasco","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.837533","20220330","longitudinal study; older adults; personal growth; personal strengths; purpose in life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29321,""

"Resilience in railway workers: Exploring what has challenged and protected railway keyworker's mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic","Railway workers are reportedly at risk of developing traumatic stress-related conditions, yet little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of railway workers. The study consisted of a cross-sectional online survey exploring the effects of COVID-19 on the mental wellbeing of railway workers (n=906) in the UK. The aim was to explore whether protective factors (adaptive resilience, team resilience and help-seeking intentions) mediated the relationship between COVID-19 risk factors (stress, risk perception and burnout) and railway workersâ€™ mental wellbeing. Responses to psychometrically valid measures were analysed using multiple regression and parallel mediation analyses. Free text data exploring railway workersâ€™ views on the impact of COVID-19 on their mental wellbeing, were analysed using content analysis. Protective factors significantly mediated the relationship between mental wellbeing and COVID-19 risk factors. Railway workers reported that they experienced mental health decline throughout the pandemic, loss of workplace supports, increased need for psychological support, and concerns for the future. Work-based supports and access to psychological input for railway workers who need it is highlighted. Building a resilient railway workforce moving forward requires attention to staff mental wellbeing and to ensuring that support systems are robust, safe and accessible.","Nicola Cogan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0056-F9B-5AB","20220331","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; mental wellbeing; covid-19; resilience; railway workers; coping","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-03-31","",29323,""
