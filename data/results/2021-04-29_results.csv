"Professionals' views on the mental health problems and vulnerability of children and young people during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic caused major disruptions to everyday life for children and young people. The aim of this study was to examine professionals' views on the mental health problems and vulnerabilities of children and young people during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a secondary analysis of an online survey completed by mental health professionals in the UK between 22 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. The final sample was N = 601 professionals who at least partly worked with children and young people. Quantitative and qualitative survey data showed that professionals were concerned about young people experiencing economic disadvantage and young people from minority ethnic groups, as pre-existing social inequalities resulted in increased risk of infection and reduced access to physical and mental health care. Professionals were concerned about young people with little family support and young people at risk of relapse or deterioration in mental health, reporting the exacerbation of pre-existing mental health difficulties and challenging behaviours. Further research, involving young people as researchers, is needed to explore the continued impact for children and young people, and their families, including in comparison to their experiences before the pandemic.","Julian Edbrooke-Childs; Angelika Labno; Melissa A.

"A Mobile Phone-Based Intervention to Reduce Mental Health Problems in Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic (PsyCovidApp): Randomized Controlled Trial","The global health emergency generated by the COVID-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented challenge to healthcare workers (HCWs), who are facing heavy workloads under psychologically difficult situations. Mental mobile Health (mHealth) interventions are now being widely deployed due to their attractive implementation features (low cost, high scalability), despite the lack of evidence about their efficacy in this specific population and context. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a psychoeducational, mindfulness-based mHealth intervention to reduce mental health problems in HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We carried out a blinded, parallel-group, controlled trial, in Spain. HCWs (any medical specialty and role) providing face-to-face healthcare to COVID-19 patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated randomization sequence to receive during two weeks the PsyCovidApp intervention (App targeting emotional skills, healthy lifestyle behavior, burnout, and social support) or a control App (general recommendations about mental healthcare). HCWs were blinded to group allocation. Data collection was conducted telephonically at baseline and after two weeks by trained health psychologists. The primary endpoint was a composite of depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS21 overall score). Secondary endpoints were insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index), burnout (Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Services Survey), posttraumatic stress (Davidson Trauma Scale), self-efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale), and depression, anxiety, and stress (DASS21 individual scale scores). Differences between groups were analyzed using general linear modeling (ANCOVA - adjusted by baseline score), according to an intention-to-treat protocol. Additionally, we measured the usability of the PsyCovidApp (System Usability Scale). Outcome data collectors and trial statisticians were unaware of treatment allocation. Between 14 May and 25 July 2020, 482 HCWs were recruited and randomly assigned to PsyCovidApp (n=248) or the control App (n=234). At two weeks, complete outcome data were available for 436 (90.5%) HCWs. No significant differences were observed between the groups at two weeks in the primary outcome (standardized mean difference -0.04;95% CI -0.11 to 0.04; P =.15) and in the rest of the outcomes. In our prespecified subgroup analyses, we observed significant improvements among HCWs consuming psychotropic medications (n=79) in the primary outcome (-0.29; 95% CI-0.48 to -0.09; P=.004), and in posttraumatic stress, insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Similarly, among HCWs receiving psychotherapy (n=43), we observed improvements in the primary outcome (-0.25;95% CI -0.49 to -0.02; P=.02), and in insomnia, anxiety, and stress. Mean (SD) usability score of PsyCovidApp was 87.21/100 (12.65), indicating high usability. After the trial, 208 of 221 (94.1%) HCWs in the intervention group requested to regain access to PsyCovidApp, indicating high acceptability. In HCWs assisting COVID-19 patients in Spain, PsyCovidApp, compared with a control App, reduced mental health problems at two weeks only among HCWs receiving psychotherapy or psychotropic medications.

"Black Adolescent Experiences with COVID-19 and Mental Health Services Utilization","COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting communities of color. Black adolescents are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19, have high mental health service needs, and have low mental health services utilization. During this time of great physical threat due to COVID-19, it is equally important to understand and support the mental health of Black adolescents. This study collected open-ended survey item responses from adolescents (12-17 years old) that identified as Black, living in a city in the Southeastern United States (n = 33). Grounded theory was used to analyze the data, revealing details of the lived experience of these Black adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Black adolescents reported that COVID-19 has been both positive and negative for them. Family is of utmost importance to them, as are their peers, whom they do not get to interact with due to changes in the operation of schools. Despite experiencing stress, adaptive responses to COVID-19 are reported. Black adolescents continue to cite issues with mental health services and providers. Financial issues were a common theme for these youth, blocking access to services and causing issues in the home environment. Mental health service providers must address the service access and quality issues repeatedly reported by Black adolescents. Direct action must be taken to facilitate an increase in Black adolescents mental health services utilization and satisfaction. Changes are needed at the individual and macro levels to alter the experience of one of our most vulnerable groups.","Banks","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01049-w","20210428","Adolescence; COVID; Mental health service","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13257,""
"Quantitative Evaluation of Aerosol Generation from Non-contact Tonometry and its Correlation with Tear Film Characteristics","Ophthalmologists are inevitably exposed to tears and ocular discharge during ophthalmologic examinations and are at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To understand the role of aerosols in disease transmission, we adopted a prospective cross-sectional study design and investigated the count and size distribution of aerosols generated by a non-contact tonometer and its correlation with individual tear film characteristics. This study constituted two parts. The study population included outpatients who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in an intraocular pressure examination room (Part I) and 20 participants who underwent an intraocular pressure examination in a laboratory (Part II). The following main outcomes were measured: aerosol counts at 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200Ã‚Â cm from the non-contact tonometer (Part I); aerosol counts after each participant underwent non-contact tonometry, and lipid layer thickness score and tear film break-up time (Part II). The aerosol count decreased with increasing distance from the tonometer. The aerosol count at 0Ã‚Â cm had the highest value compared to that at other distances. For aerosols of diameters 0.25-0.5Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼m and 0.5-1.0Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼m, the count decreased at 50Ã‚Â cm and remained stable at further distances. For aerosols of diameters 1.0-2.5Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼m andÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.5Ã‚Â ÃŽÂ¼m, the count dropped progressively at all five distances. The aerosol count from each tonometer correlated positively with the lipid layer thickness score (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.490, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.028), whereas the aerosol count correlated negatively with the tear film break-up time (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.675, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Aerosols tended to coagulate during diffusion. A 50-cm distance from the tonometer could confer safety from aerosols withÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.0-ÃŽÂ¼m diameter. Aerosols generated during non-contact tonometry could contain a lipid layer component. Moreover, tear film stability could affect aerosol generation. Protective eyewear is recommended for reducing infection risk from aerosols. Individual tear film characteristics should be considered during non-contact tonometry.","Hao, Wu, Zhao, Liang, Yu, Cao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12325-021-01740-8","20210428","Aerosols; COVID-19; Non-contact tonometry; Ophthalmology; SARS-CoV-2; Tear film","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13258,""
"Pandemic Birthing: Childbirth Satisfaction, Perceived Health Care Bias, and Postpartum Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on birth satisfaction and perceived health care discrimination during childbirth, and in turn, the influence of these birth experiences on postpartum health. We conducted a cross-sectional, bilingual web survey of 237 women who gave birth at two hospitals in New York City and assessed patient-reported experience and outcomes following the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the New York region. We ascertained SARS-CoV-2 status at delivery from the electronic medical record using participant-reported name and date of birth. We compared birth experience during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020-May 11, 2020) to a pre-pandemic response period (January 1, 2020-March 14, 2020). We estimated risk ratios for associations between birth experience and anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, birth-related PTSD, emergency department visits, timely postpartum visit, and exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariable models adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, insurance, education, parity, BMI, previous experience of maltreatment/abuse and cesarean delivery. Women who gave birth during the peak of the pandemic response, and those that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, Black, and Latina, had lower birth satisfaction and higher perceived health care discrimination. Women with lower birth satisfaction were more likely to report higher postpartum anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and lower exclusive breastfeeding. Experiencing one or more incident of health care discrimination was associated with higher levels of postpartum stress and birth-related PTSD. Hospitals and policy-makers should institute measures to safeguard against a negative birth experience during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among birthing people of color.","Janevic, Maru, Nowlin, McCarthy, Bergink, Stone, Dias, Wu, Howell","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-021-03158-8","20210428","Birth experience; Breastfeeding; COVID-19; Ethnicity; Health care discrimination; Postpartum mental health; Race; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13259,""

"The association between high risk of sleep apnea, comorbidities, and risk of COVID-19: a population-based international harmonized study","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may increase the risk of severe COVID-19; however, the level of potential modulation has not yet been established. The objective of the study was to determine the association between high risk of OSA, comorbidities, and increased risk for COVID-19, hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. We conducted a cross-sectional population-based web survey in adults in 14 countries/regions. The survey included sociodemographic variables and comorbidities. Participants were asked questions about COVID-19, hospitalization, and ICU treatment. Standardized questionnaire (STOP questionnaire for high risk of OSA) was included. Multivariable logistic regression was conducted adjusting for various factors. Out of 26,539 respondents, 20,598 (35.4% male) completed the survey. Mean age and BMI of participants were 41.5 Ã‚Â± 16.0 years and 24.0 Ã‚Â± 5.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed OSA was 4.1% and high risk of OSA was 9.5%. We found that high risk of OSA (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.72, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20, 2.47) and diabetes (aOR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23, 3.48) were associated with reporting of a COVID-19 diagnosis. High risk for OSA (aOR 2.11, 95% CI: 1.10-4.01), being male (aOR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.55-5.12), having diabetes (aOR: 3.93, 95% CI: 1.70-9.12), and having depression (aOR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.15-4.77) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization or ICU treatment.

"Changes in the Psychological State of Medical Personnel in the Department of Radiotherapy at a Tertiary Care Teaching Hospital in China during the Epidemic","The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the psychological state of medical personnel in the Department of Radiotherapy during the COVID-19 epidemic. Psychological state was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). All three questionnaires were first completed by medical personnel on 17-18 February 2020 and were repeated every 3 months thereafter until 17-18 August. The number and intentions of patients receiving radiotherapy (RT) in our department were also collected. Twenty medical personnel participated in the present study. The global PSQI score recorded in August was significantly lower than that recorded in February (P = 0.045). Among the seven components of the PSQI, sleep quality (P = 0.048) and daytime dysfunction (P = 0.006) in August were significantly improved compared with February, whereas SDS and SAS did not significantly differ among the three different time points. The proportion of patients who received palliative radiotherapy was significantly higher on 18 May than on 17 February (P = 0.005). Medical personnel in the Department of Radiotherapy experienced a significantly elevated incidence of sleeping problems during the early COVID-19 outbreak period. Multiple combinations of protective measures to avoid infection could improve sleep quality and ensure the safe delivery of RT to cancer patients.","Chen, Zhan, Xu, Wu, Jia, Liang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1093/annweh/wxab015","20210428","COVID-19; medical personnel; mental health; radiotherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13262,""
"Adverse and Benevolent Childhood Experiences Predict Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with poorer adult mental health, and benevolent childhood experiences (BCEs) are associated with better adult mental health. This study aims to test whether ACEs and BCEs predict adult mental health above and beyond current stress and social support during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyzed data from undergraduate and graduate students (<i>N</i> = 502) at an urban private university in the Western United States. An online survey was conducted to assess ACEs and BCEs, current stress and social support, depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and loneliness in May 2020. Higher levels of ACEs were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = 0.45, <i>p</i> = 0.002. Higher levels of BCEs were associated with lower depressive symptoms, <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.39, <i>p</i> = 0.03; lower perceived stress, <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.002; and less loneliness, <i>ÃŽÂ²</i> = -0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.04. These associations held while controlling for current stress, social support, and socioeconomic status. Childhood experiences are associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. BCEs should be considered an important promotive factor, independent of ACEs, for psychological well-being during a global public health crisis. BCEs should be included along with ACEs in future research, assessment, and screening with distressed and vulnerable populations.","Doom, Seok, Narayan, Fox","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42844-021-00038-6","20210428","Adverse childhood experiences; Benevolent childhood experiences; COVID-19; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13263,""
"Psychiatric disorders among hospitalized patients deceased with COVID-19 in Italy","there is concern about the increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 severe outcomes and disparity of care among patients with a psychiatric disorder (PD). Based on the Italian COVID-19 death surveillance, which collects data from all the hospitals throughout the country, we aimed to describe clinical features and care pathway of patients dying with COVID-19 and a preceding diagnosis of a PD. in this cross-sectional study, the characteristics of a representative sample of patients, who have died with COVID-19 in Italian hospitals between February 21st and August 3rd 2020, were drawn from medical charts, described and analysed by multinomial logistic regression according to the recorded psychiatric diagnosis: no PD, severe PD (SPD) (i.e. schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders), common mental disorder (CMD) (i.e. depression without psychotic features, anxiety disorders). the 4020 COVID-19 deaths included in the study took place in 365 hospitals across Italy. Out of the 4020 deceased patients, 84 (2Ã¢â‚¬Â¢1%) had a previous SPD, 177 (4.4%) a CMD. The mean age at death was 78.0 (95%CI 77.6-78.3) years among patients without a PD, 71.8 (95%CI 69.3-72.0) among those with an SPD, 79.5 (95%CI 78.0-81.1) in individuals with a CMD. 2253 (61.2%) patients without a PD, 62 (73.8%) with an SPD, and 136 (78.2%) with a CMD were diagnosed with three or more non-psychiatric comorbidities.When we adjusted for clinically relevant variables, including hospital of death, we found that SPD patients died at a younger age than those without a PD (adjusted OR per 1 year increment 0.96; 95% CI 0.94-0.98). Women were significantly more represented among CMD patients compared to patients without previous psychiatric history (aOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.05-2.32). Hospital admission from long-term care facilities (LTCFs) was strongly associated with having an SPD (aOR 9.02; 95% CI 4.99-16.3) or a CMD (aOR 2.09; 95% CI 1.19-3.66). Comorbidity burden, fever, admission to intensive careÃ‚Â and time from symptoms' onset to nasopharyngeal swab did not result significantly associated with an SPD or with a CMD in comparison to those without any PD. even where equal treatment is in place, the vulnerability of patients with a PD may reduce their chance of recovering from COVID-19. The promotion of personalised therapeutic projects aimed at including people with PD in the community rather than in non-psychiatric LTCFs should be prioritised.","Lega, NisticÃƒÂ², Palmieri, Caroppo, Lo Noce, Donfrancesco, Vanacore, Scattoni, Picardi, Gigantesco, Brusaferro, Onder","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2021.100854","20210428","COVID-19; Death; Hospital; Psychiatric disorders; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13264,""
"A Perfect Storm? Health Anxiety, Contamination Fears, and COVID-19: Lessons Learned from Past Pandemics and Current Challenges","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread, becoming a global pandemic with significant health, economic, and social impacts. COVID-19 has caused widespread anxiety, which at healthy levels leads to adaptive, protective behavioral changes. For some individuals, a pandemic outbreak can lead to excessive, maladaptive levels of anxiety, particularly among those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and health anxiety. In the present paper, we review past research studies that examined anxiety in response to other disease outbreaks (including Swine Flu, Zika, and Ebola) to serve as a guide for expectable responses to COVID-19. Our review focused on the role of belief-based cognitive variables (obsessive beliefs, contamination cognitions), transdiagnostic processes (disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, an intolerance of uncertainty), social factors, and environmental/situational variables as contributing factors to excessive concerns about past pandemics. These factors in combination with unique characteristics of the virus (disease, behavioral, social and economic factors) and media consumption might enhance vulnerability to excessive anxiety about COVID-19, in line with a diathesis-stress model. COVID-19 is also unique from past pandemics due to its severity, easy transmissibility, and the nature of prescribed behavioral responses (i.e., hand washing and social distancing). We therefore discuss the ways in which COVID-19 may disproportionately affect individuals with OCD and health anxiety. We conclude with important topics for clinical and research attention to help mental health professionals respond in this time of crisis.","Dennis, Radnitz, Wheaton","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41811-021-00109-7","20210428","COVID-19; Contamination; Health anxiety; OCD; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-29","",13265,""

Results show that about 88% of students experienced moderate to severe stress, with 44% of students showing moderate to severe anxiety and 36% of students having moderate to severe depression. In particular, female, rural, low-income, and academically underperforming students were more vulnerable to these mental health issues.

"Trait mindfulness is negatively associated with distress related to COVID-19","Research suggests that mindfulness is associated with psychological health including a healthier response to stressors. This research tested associations between trait mindfulness and mental health factors related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). Two studies (Study 1Ã‚Â <i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 248 college students; Study 2Ã‚Â <i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 300Ã‚Â U.S adults) assessed trait mindfulness, perceived stress and anxiety, worry about the coronavirus, and anticipated negative affect of a coronavirus diagnosis. Additionally, Study 2 assessed depressive symptoms and coping with the coronavirus. In both studies, findings indicated that individuals higher in trait mindfulness reported less stress and anxiety. Higher mindfulness in both studies was also associated with less worry about the virus and anticipating less negative affect if one gets the virus. In Study 2, trait mindfulness was negatively related to depression, and numerous associations between mindfulness and coping emerged, showing higher trait mindfulness was associated with healthier strategies in coping with coronavirus. These data are consistent with research that has revealed that those who think and act more mindfully are less stressed and anxious.
