"Intergroup Contact, COVID-19 News Consumption, and the Moderating Role of Digital Media Trust on Prejudice toward Asians in the US: A Cross-Sectional Study","BACKGROUND: The perceived threat of a highly contagious virus may lead people to be distrustful of immigrants and outgroups  Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the salient politicized discourses of blaming Chinese people for spreading the virus have fueled over 2,000 reports of anti-Asian racial incidents and hate crimes in the U S   OBJECTIVE: The study aims to investigate the relationships between news consumption, trust, intergroup contact, and prejudicial attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans residing in the U S  during the COVID-19 pandemic  We compare how traditional news, social media use, and biased news exposure cultivate racial attitudes  The moderating role of media use and trust on prejudice against Asians is examined  METHODS: A cross-sectional study was completed in May 2020  A total of 430 U S  adults (mean age 36 75, SD 11 49;60% male) participated in an online survey through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform  Respondents answered questions related to traditional news exposure, social media use, perceived trust, and their top three news channels for staying informed about the novel coronavirus  In addition, intergroup contact and racial attitudes toward Asians were assessed  We performed hierarchical regression analyses to test the associations  Moderation effects were estimated using simple slopes testing with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval approach  RESULTS: Participants who identified as conservatives (ÃŸ= 08, P= 02), had personal infection history (ÃŸ= 10, P= 004), and interacted with Asian people frequently in their daily lives (ÃŸ= 46, P&lt; 001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians after controlling for sociodemographic variables  Relying more on traditional news media (ÃŸ= 08, P= 04) and higher levels of trust in social media (ÃŸ= 13, P= 007) were positively associated with prejudice against Asians  In contrast, consuming news from left-leaning outlets (ÃŸ=- 15, P= 001) and neutral outlets (ÃŸ=- 13, P= 003) was linked to less prejudicial attitudes toward Asians  Among those who had high trust in social media, exposure had a strong negative relationship with prejudice  At high levels of trust in digital websites and apps, frequent use was related to less unfavorable attitudes toward Asians  CONCLUSIONS: Experiencing racial prejudice among the Asian population during a challenging pandemic can cause poor psychological outcomes and exacerbate health disparities  The results suggest that conservative ideology, personal infection history, frequency of intergroup contact, traditional news exposure, and trust in social media emerge as positive predictors of prejudice against Asians/Asians Americans, whereas people who get COVID news from left-leaning and balanced outlets show less prejudice  For those who trust more in social media and digital news, frequent use of these two sources is associated with lower levels of prejudice  Our findings highlight the need to reshape traditional news discourses and utilize social media/mobile news apps to develop credible messages for combating racial prejudice against Asians  CLINICALTRIAL: None","","https://doi.org/10.2196/22767","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4839,""
"Homebirthing in the United Kingdom during COVID-19","COVID-19 has significantly impacted all aspects of maternity services in the United Kingdom, exacerbating the fact that choice is insufficiently centred within the maternity regime  In this article, we focus on the restrictions placed on homebirthing services by some National Health Service Trusts in response to the virus  In March 2020, around a third of Trusts implemented blanket policies suspending their entire homebirth service  We argue that the failure to protect choice about place of birth during the pandemic may not only be harmful to birthing people?s physical and mental health, but also that it is legally problematic as it may, in some instances, breach human rights obligations  We also voice concerns about the possibility that in the absence of available homebirthing services people might choose to freebirth  While freebirthing (birthing absent any medical or midwifery support) is not innately problematic, it is concerning that people may feel forced to opt for this","","https://doi.org/10.1177/0968533220955224","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Medical Law International;2020.; Publication details: Medical Law International;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4840,""
"Planetary Silicon Valley: Deconstructing New Yorkâ€™s innovation complex","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital platforms and software for operating remotely and encouraged employers to reshape the workplace for social distancing  But it is not at all clear what these arrangements will mean for cities that have spent the past decade building an ?innovation complex? around physical density, digital technology and real estate development  On the one hand, many parts of the tech ecosystem that relied on face-to-face interaction ? such as coworking spaces, hackathons and venture capitalists? mentoring of start-up founders ? have already moved online  On the other hand, cutting tech ecosystems loose from place-based offices, labour markets and institutional networks puts cities? economic future at risk  This could drastically weaken the value of the city?s fixed capital of buildings and land, its social capital of institutional networks and communities, and its human capital of workers with tech skills  Yet partnering with tech leaders to ?reimagine? the city could advance the power of Big Tech  To try to understand which parts of the urban tech ecosystem will likely survive the pandemic, I take a critical look at how the discursive, organisational and geographical spaces of a planetary Silicon Valley culture became embedded in New York between 2010 and 2020","","https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098020951421","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Urban Studies;2020.; Publication details: Urban Studies;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4841,""

"Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences","Intro When confronted with major threats, people often experience decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying change of well-being in times of threat, using the example of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on appraisals of the pandemic and affective states, stress, as well as mindfulness in daily life. METHODS: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. We worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as 7189 observations from the diary phase. RESULTS: Results showed that deterioration in mental health symptoms across the duration of the study was associated with (a) change towards less fortunate appraisals of the pandemic and (b), more negative affect and less mindfulness in daily life. Furthermore, appraisals of the pandemic at pretest predicted experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and highlight the role of experiences in daily life in changes in well-being.","Brose, Blanke, Schmiedek, Kramer, Schmidt, Neubauer","https://doi.org/10.1111/jopy.12592","20200916","COVID-19; affect; ambulatory assessment; mental health; mindfulness; stress; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4853,""
"Natural Language Processing Reveals Vulnerable Mental Health Support Groups and Heightened Health Anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19: An Observational Study","The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a &quot;guns&quot; semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories &quot;economic stress&quot;, &quot;isolation&quot;, and &quot;home&quot; while others such as &quot;motion&quot; significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (ÃÂ = -0.96, P&lt;.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.","Low, Rumker, Talker, Torous, Cecchi, Ghosh","https://doi.org/10.2196/22635","20200916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4854,""
"Associations between COVID-19 specific information exposure, mental health and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures: evidence from a cross-sectional study at the initial phase of work resumption following the COVID-19 outbreak in China","Risk and crisis communication plays an essential role in public health emergency response. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered spontaneous and intensive media attention, which affects both the public's adoption of personal preventive measures and mental health. This study investigated the associations between exposure to COVID-19 specific information and mental health (depression and sleep quality) and self-reported compliance with personal preventive measures (facemask wearing and hand sanitizing); and tested whether such associations were moderated by thoughtful consideration of the veracity of exposed information. A cross-sectional closed online survey was conducted among a sample of factory workers at the beginning of work resumption in Shenzhen, China. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling design was used for recruitment. A total of 3,035 factory workers that had resumed work completed an online self-administered questionnaire. Multivariate linear and logistic regression models were used for analyses. The prevalence of probable moderate-to-severe depression and good/excellent sleep quality was 5.6% (n=170) and 69.5% (n=2,110), respectively. The prevalence of self-reported consistent facemask wearing in any public places and sanitizing hands every time after returning from public spaces or touching installations was 95.7% (n=2,903) and 70.9% (n=2,151), respectively. Around 33.3-54.0% reported a daily exposure to COVID-19 specific information through online media and television for more than one hour. After controlling for significant background variables, higher information exposure via television and newspaper/magazines were associated with better sleep quality (adjusted B=0.05 &amp; 0.07, P&lt;.001) and higher self-reported compliance with hand sanitizing (adjusted odds ratios [AOR]=1.18 &amp; 1.21, P&lt;.001). Higher exposure via online unofficial media was associated with better self-reported compliance with hand sanitizing (AOR=1.08, P=.037) but also higher depressive symptoms (adjusted B=0.20, P=.001). In contrast, higher exposure through face-to-face communication was associated with higher depressive symptoms (adjusted B=0.45, P&lt;.001), worse sleep quality (adjusted B=-0.04, P=.012), and poorer self-reported compliance with hand sanitizing (AOR=0.91, P=.020). Exposure to information about COVID-19 patients' positive outcomes, development of vaccines/effective treatment and heroic stories about frontline healthcare workers were associated with both better mental health and higher self-reported compliance with preventive measures. Higher overall information exposure was associated with higher depressive symptoms among participants who were less likely to carefully consider the veracity of exposed information, while also associated with better sleep quality among those with more thoughtful consideration of exposed information. This study provides empirical evidence on how amount, sources, and contents of information exposure influenced mental health and compliance with personal preventive measures at the initial phase of work resumption in China; and thoughtful consideration of information quality played an important moderating role. Our findings may inform strategic risk communication used by government and public health authorities during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pan, Xin, Zhang, Dong, Fang, Wu, Li, Pang, Zheng, Wang, Yuan, He","https://doi.org/10.2196/22596","20200916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4855,""
"The Resurgence of Cyber-Racism COVID-19 Pandemic and its After Effects","With the increasing number of patients of COVID-19 all over the world, a particular section of the world population has been blaming China and World Health Organization for the spread of this disease.

With Donald Trump using the term Chinese Virus, this cause has gained momentum and Ethnic Asians are now being targeted. The online situation also looks the same where certain segment of people are posting hateful comments and posts. The research study has been done to analyze the increasing racism online during COVID-19. This research aims to analyze the emotions and sentiments that have been associated with the terms like Chinese Virus, Wuhan Virus and Chinese Corona Virus. 16,000 tweets ranging from 11th April 2020 to 16th April 2020 were analyzed to find out the sentiments and emotions associated with the posts. This research has been done on R. Twitter API and SentimentR package were used for the collection of the tweets and then evaluating the sentiments respectively. This results suggested that majority of the tweets were of negative sentiments and carried emotions of fear, sadness, anger and disgust. There were a high usage of slurs and profane words. Also, terms like China LieD People Died, Wuhan Health Organization, Kung Flu, China Must Pay and CCP is Terrorist were used a lot in these tweets. This study gives an insight of the rising hatred and cyber racism on Twitter. This study has analyzed the twitter posts and concludes that there are a majority of people who are tweeting with mostly negative sentiments for ethnic Asian, China and WHO.","Dubey","https://doi.org/10.2196/19833","20200916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4856,""

"COVID-19: Preliminary Data on the Impact of Social Distancing on Loneliness and Mental Health","The COVID-19 pandemic and its need for social distancing as a response have the potential to increase the experience of loneliness in the population, with an associated increase in symptoms of mental disorders. As the world has largely adapted to remote platforms for employment, socializing, and health service delivery, the degree to which virtual opportunities for social engagement may offset the impact of limited in-person interactions on mental health functioning is unknown. This column offers preliminary data from an ongoing experience sampling study of the prevalence, course, and impact of loneliness on mental health in a community adult sample living under social distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Initial findings aggregated across all experience sampling reports showed negative associations between virtual social contact (via text, phone, or videoconferencing) and feelings of loneliness, while in-person interactions appeared to have no impact on loneliness. In addition, respondents reported frequent instances of negative effects on physical and mental health, including disruptions in sleep and recurring suicidal ideation. While further analyses are needed, these findings are consistent with similar emerging reports showing increased rates of mental health concerns during periods of social distancing. Possible avenues for addressing these concerns using remote interventions are explored.","Lewis","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000488","20200916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4858,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological and behavioral responses to the shutdown of the beauty industry","During the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia implemented widespread closure of beauty and cosmetic services to control the virus spread. The effect of these restrictions is unknown, given that beauty services are widely used for stress relief or to enhance confidence. The current study explored the relationship between engagement in appearance-focused behaviors and distress regarding beauty service closure. Participants with high and low levels of dysmorphic concern were compared to determine whether COVID-19 restrictions may affect these groups differently. An online survey was completed by 216 participants living in Australia. Questions addressed engagement in appearance-focused behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic and attitudes toward beauty service closure. The Dysmorphic Concern Questionnaire (DCQ) was used to group participants by low and high dysmorphic concern. Appearance-focused behaviors decreased in the low DCQ group (n = 163) during the COVID-19 pandemic, while such behaviors in the high DCQ group (n = 53) remained unchanged. Individuals who were living alone, younger, reported higher dysmorphic concern and greater distress over beauty service closure engaged in more frequent appearance-focused behaviors (R<sup>2</sup> = .57, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The high DCQ group reported greater distress over beauty service closure and increased desire to obtain future beauty treatments. While COVID-19 restrictions may have provided a break from societal appearance pressure for those with low dysmorphic concern, appearance-focused behaviors persisted in individuals with high dysmorphic concern. A greater understanding of the long-term impacts on appearance-related distress is needed to determine mental health priorities emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pikoos, Buzwell, Sharp, Rossell","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23385","20200916","COVID-19; Coronavirus; appearance; body dysmorphic disorder; body image; cosmetic surgery; cosmetic treatment; dysmorphic concern; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4859,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of patients with inherited bleeding disorders in Germany","The worldwide pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2 can lead to either respiratory infection or containment-associated isolation with possible higher impact on chronic diseases such as inherited bleeding disorders (IBD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on patients and caregivers of IBD patients regarding their concerns and worries related to own health, access to treatment and availability of factor concentrates and their experiences related to medical care. Multicentre, cross-sectional study evaluating the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of IBD patients. An ad hoc questionnaire was developed and sent to 586 patients/caregivers with haemophilia A, haemophilia B and VWD type III. The survey included information on demographic and clinical data, needs, concerns and experiences regarding medical care during COVID-19 pandemic. In total, 355 of the IBD-Group (200 patients, 155 caregivers) completed the survey (61.7% response rate). Most patients suffered from haemophilia A (73.8%) and were severely affected (64.7%). Eleven patients were in quarantine due to suspected COVID-19; none had symptoms. One quarter worried (very) strongly about getting the coronavirus, 71.3% asked themselves what will happen to them when they will get COVID-19, 40.1% felt unchanged, and 18.9% worried about delivery difficulties of their IBD treatment product. In 52.8%, medical appointments were postponed. Significant differences between caregivers and patients were found in most aspects. The IBD patients affected by a chronic disorder have particular thoughts and worries regarding COVID-19. Haemophilia specialists should be committed to address these concerns and guarantee treatment despite containment strategies.","von Mackensen, Halimeh, Siebert, Wermes, Hassenpflug, Holstein, Olivieri","https://doi.org/10.1111/hae.14130","20200916","COVID-19; bleeding disorder; mental health; patient survey; worries and concerns","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4860,""
"Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak in Urban Settings in China","The COVID-19 outbreak in China was devastating, and spread throughout the country before being contained. Stringent physical distancing recommendations and shelter-in-place were first introduced in the hardest-hit provinces, and by March, these recommendations were uniform throughout the country. In the presence of an evolving and deadly pandemic, we sought to investigate the impact of this pandemic on individual well-being and prevention practices among Chinese urban residents. From March 2-11, 2020, 4,607 individuals were recruited from 11 provinces with varying numbers of COVID-19 casers using the social networking app WeChat to complete a brief, anonymous, online survey. The analytical sample was restricted to 2,551 urban residents. Standardized scales measured generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the primary outcome. Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify correlates of GAD alongside assessment of community practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, recommended public health practices significantly <i>(p</i> &lt;0.001) increased, including wearing facial mask, practicing physical distancing, handwashing, decreased public spitting, and going outside in urban communities. Overall, 40.3% of participants met screening criteria for GAD and 49.3%, 62.6%, and 55.4% reported that their work, social life, and family life were interrupted by anxious feelings, respectively. Independent correlates of having anxiety symptoms included being a healthcare provider (aOR=1.58, <i>p</i> &lt;0.01), living in regions with a higher density of COVID-19 cases (aOR=2.13, <i>p</i> &lt;0.01), having completed college (aOR=1.38, <i>p</i> =0.03), meeting screening criteria for depression (aOR=6.03, <i>p</i> &lt;0.01) and poorer perceived health status (aOR=1.54, <i>p</i> &lt;0.01). COVID-19 had a profound impact on the health of urban dwellers throughout China. Not only did they markedly increase their self- and community-protective behaviors, but they also experienced high levels of anxiety associated with a heightened vulnerability like depression, having poor perceived health, and the potential of increased exposure to COVID-19 such as living closer to the epicenter of the pandemic.","Ni, Lebowitz, Zou, Wang, Liu, Shrestha, Zhang, Hu, Yang, Xu, Wu, Altice","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-71833/v1","20200916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4861,""
"How mu-Opioid Receptor Recognizes Fentanyl","The opioid crisis has escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the overdose-related deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, crystal structures of mOR complexed with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine H297, which has been shown to modulate mOR's ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when H297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding mOR activation by fentanyl analogs that are emerging at a rapid pace and assisting the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.","Vo, Mahinthichaichan, Shen, Ellis","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-67888/v1","20200916","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4862,""
"Molecular neuro-biological and systemic health benefits of achieving dopamine homeostasis in the face of a catastrophic pandemic (COVID- 19): A mechanistic exploration","In the face of the global pandemic of COVID 19, approaching 1.75 Million infected worldwide (4/12/2020) and associated mortality (over 108, 000 as of 4/12/2020) as well-as other catastrophic events including the opioid crisis, a focus on brain health seems prudent [1] (https://www.coronavirus.gov). This manuscript reports on the systemic benefits of restoring and achieving dopamine homeostasis to reverse and normalize thoughts and behaviors of Reward Deficiency Syndrome (RDS) dysfunctional conditions and their effects on behavioral physiology; function of reward genes; and focuses on digestive, immune, eye health, and the constellation of symptomatic behaviors. The role of nutrigenomic interventions on restoring normal brain functions and its benefits on these systems will be discussed. We demonstrate that modulation of dopamine homeostasis using nutrigenomic dopamine agonists, instead of pharmaceutical interventions, is achievable. The allied interlinking with diverse chronic diseases and disorders, roles of free radicals and incidence of anaerobic events have been extensively highlighted. In conjunction, the role of dopamine in aspects of sleep, rapid eye movement and waking are extensively discussed. The integral aspects of food indulgence, the influence of taste sensations, and gut-brain signaling are also discussed along with a special emphasis on ocular health. The detailed mechanistic insight of dopamine, immune competence and the allied aspects of autoimmune disorders are also highlighted. Finally, the integration of dopamine homeostasis utilizing a patented gene test and a research-validated nutrigenomic intervention are presented. Overall, a cutting-edge nutrigenomic intervention could prove to be a technological paradigm shift in our understanding of the extent to which achieving dopamine homeostasis will benefit overall health.","Downs, Blum, Bagchi, Kushner, Bagchi, Galvin, Lewis, Siwicki, Brewer, Boyett, Baron, Giordano, Badgaiyan","https://doi.org/10.15761/JSIN.1000228","20200916","anaerobic; dopamine; dopamine homeostasis; hypoxic; neurotrophic; reward deficiency syndrome","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4863,""
"Mental health in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: cross-sectional analyses from a community cohort study","Previous pandemics have resulted in significant consequences for mental health. Here, we report the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK cohort and examine modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with mental health outcomes. We focus on the first wave of data collection, which examined short-term consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced. Cross-sectional online survey. Community cohort study. N=3097 adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years were recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. The cohort was predominantly female (n=2618); mean age 44 years; 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic groups; 50% (n=1559) described themselves as key workers and 20% (n=649) identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19. Depression, anxiety and stress scores. Mean scores for depression ([Formula: see text] =7.69, SD=6.0), stress ([Formula: see text] =6.48, SD=3.3) and anxiety ([Formula: see text] = 6.48, SD=3.3) significantly exceeded population norms (all p&lt;0.0001). Analysis of non-modifiable factors hypothesised to be associated with mental health outcomes indicated that being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group were associated with increased stress, anxiety and depression, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7%-14% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54%-57% of total variance. Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK sample and found to be more common in younger people, women and in individuals who identified as being in recognised COVID-19 risk groups. Public health and mental health interventions able to ameliorate perceptions of risk of COVID-19, worry about COVID-19 loneliness and boost positive mood may be effective.","Jia, Ayling, Chalder, Massey, Broadbent, Coupland, Vedhara","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040620","20200916","mental health; psychiatry; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4864,""

"Suddenly Becoming a &quot;Virtual Doctor&quot;: Experiences of Psychiatrists Transitioning to Telemedicine During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many psychiatrists have rapidly transitioned to telemedicine. This qualitative study sought to understand how this dramatic change in delivery has affected mental health care, including modes of telemedicine psychiatrists used, barriers encountered, and future plans. The aim was to inform the ongoing COVID-19 response and pass on lessons learned to psychiatrists who are starting to offer telemedicine. From March 31 to April 9, 2020, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 outpatient psychiatrists practicing in five U.S. states with significant early COVID-19 activity. Inductive and deductive approaches were used to develop interview summaries, and a matrix analysis was conducted to identify and refine themes. At the time of the interviews, all 20 psychiatrists had been using telemedicine for 2-4 weeks. Telemedicine encompassed video visits, phone visits, or both. Although many continued to prefer in-person care and planned to return to it after the pandemic, psychiatrists largely perceived the transition positively. However, several noted challenges affecting the quality of provider-patient interactions, such as decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and increased distractions in the patient's home setting. Several psychiatrists noted that their disadvantaged patients lacked reliable access to a smartphone, computer, or the Internet. Participants identified several strategies that helped them improve telemedicine visit quality. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven a dramatic shift in how psychiatrists deliver care. Findings highlight that although psychiatrists expressed some concerns about the quality of these encounters, the transition has been largely positive for both patients and physicians.","Uscher-Pines, Sousa, Raja, Mehrotra, Barnett, Huskamp","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000250","20200916","COVID-19; Health care delivery; Telehealth; Telemedicine; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4867,""
"The COVID-19 cannabis health study: Results from an epidemiologic assessment of adults who use cannabis for medicinal reasons in the United States","Clinical indications for medicinal cannabis include chronic conditions; thus users (MCUs) are at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19). The study aimed to provide data on cannabis use and self-reported behavioral changes among MCUs with preexisting chronic conditions in response to the pandemic. An internet-based questionnaire was administered to adults Ã¢â€°Â¥18 who self-reported medicinal cannabis use within the past year. Data are from respondents between March 21 and April 23, 2020; response rate was 83.3%. Health conditions and cannabis frequency, route, and patterns of use were assessed via the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Questionnaire (Vidot et al. 2020). Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1202) were predominantly non-Hispanic white (82.5%) and 52.0% male (mean age 47.2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years).

Two percent (2.1%) have been tested for COVID-19 with only 1 positive test result. Some MCUs (16%) changed their route of cannabis administration, switching to nonsmoking forms. The majority of MCUs reported at least one preexisting chronic health condition. Over half report fear of COVID-19 diagnosis and giving the virus to someone else; yet only some switched from smoking to nonsmoking forms of cannabis.

This cross-sectional survey collected data from 821 respondents, using an anonymous online questionnaire designed by the Yonsei Global Health Center, from 23 March to 20 April 2020, which included socio-demographic questions, knowledge and perceptions of COVID-19, preventative practices, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scale to assess mental health. High proportions of respondents showed good knowledge of the transmission pathways and information related to COVID-19. Contact history as well as concerns about family members and the disease showed statistically significant distinctions by nationality and gender. On the whole, all participants reported good levels of preventative practices. The Chinese group reported the highest preventative practice scores; and females scored higher than males. Moreover, the Japanese group showed the most severe depressive states; overall, females experienced more severe depression than males.

"Psychological Impact of COVID-19 Confinement and Its Relationship with Meditation","The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychological impact of confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic, considering any protective factors, such as the practice of meditation or self-compassion, and their relationship with different lifestyles and circumstances of adults residing in Spain. A cross-sectional study was done using an anonymous online survey in which 412 participants filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-2; the Impact of Events Scale; and the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form, reporting severe symptomatology of posttraumatic stress and mild anxiety and depression. Quality of cohabitation and age were found to be key variables in the psychological impact of confinement.

"Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on OCD symptoms among university students: a prospective survey","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with common mental health problems. Evidence of the association between fear of COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is limited. This study aimed to examine if fear of negative events affects the score of Yale-Brown obsessive compulsive scale (Y-BOCS) in a COVID-19-fear-invoke environment. All participants were medical university students and voluntarily completed three surveys via smart-phone or computer. Survey 1 was conducted on Feb. 8, 2020 after two-week quarantine without online courses, Survey 2 was conducted on March 25, 2020 when participants had been taking online courses for two weeks, and Survey 3 on April 28, 2020 when no new case had been reported for two weeks. We used a battery of questionnaire in Surveys, including basic information (age, gender, having sibling, enrollment year, major), knowledge on COVID-19 (0 for 'do not know' and 3 for 'very knowledgeable', The fear (0 for 'no fear' and 9 for 'extreme fear'), Y-BOCS, and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Survey 1 showed that 1519 of 13478 (11.3%) participants scored Ã¢â€°Â¥16 on Y-BOCS, defined as possible OCD. Survey 2 and Survey 3 demonstrated 3.6% (305 of 8162) and 3.5% (305 of 8511), respectively. The Y-BOCS score, anxiety level, quarantine level, and intensity of fear were significantly lower at Surveys 2 and 3 than that at Survey 1 (P&lt;.001 for all). Compared to those with a lower Y-BOCS score (&lt;16), participants with possible OCD had higher intensity of fear and SAS standard score (P&lt;.001). The regression linear analysis indicated that the intensity of fear was positively correlated to the rate of possible OCD and the average total scores for Y-BOCS in each survey (P&lt;.001 for all). Multiple regressions indicated that those with higher intensity of fear, higher anxiety level, are male, have sibling(s), and majored in non-medicine predicted higher Y-BOCS score in all surveys. These results were re-demonstrated in 5827 matched participants of Survey 1 and Survey 2 and in 4006 matched participants from three surveys. Furthermore, in matched participants, the Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated to the changes of the intensity of fear (r=0.63 for Survey 2 and 0.74 for Survey 3, P&lt;.01). Our findings indicated that the fear of COVID-19 was associated with the increase of Y-BOCS score, suggesting that environment x psychology interaction might be involved in OCD and that a fear of negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD.","Ji, Yue, Li, Shi, Ma, He, Zhou, Zhao, Lou, Cheng, Yang, Wei, Hu","https://doi.org/10.2196/21915","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4872,""
"Mental Health Practitioners' Immediate Practical Response during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress, signaling the need for increased mental health services in the context of stay-at-home policies. Objectives. The present study aimed to characterize how mental health practitioners have changed their practices during the pandemic. The authors hypothesized that mental health practitioners would increase tele-mental health services and that certain provider types would be better able to adapt to tele-mental health than others. Methods. The study surveyed 903 practitioners, primarily psychologists/doctoral-level (Psych/DL) providers, social workers/master's-level (SW/ML) providers, and neuropsychologists employed in academic medical centers or private practices. Differences among providers were examined using Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and one-way Bonferroni-adjusted ANCOVAs. Results. Mental health practitioners rapidly adjusted their practices, predominantly by shifting to tele-mental health appointments (80.80%). Whereas 80.44% were not using tele-mental health in December 2019, only 22.07% were not by late March/early April 2020. Only 2.11% reported no COVID-19-related practice adjustments. Two-thirds (67.10%) reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns. Neuropsychologists were less likely, and Psych/DL providers and SW/ML providers were more likely than expected to transition to tele-mental health (p &lt; .001). Trainees saw fewer patients (p = .012) and worked remotely more than licensed providers (p = .026). Despite lower rates of IT service access (p &lt; .001), private practice providers reported less difficulty implementing tele-mental health than providers in other settings (p &lt; .001). Overall, the majority (59.6%) were interested in continuing to provide tele-mental health services in the future. Conclusions. The vast majority of mental health providers in this study made practice adjustments in response to COVID-19, predominantly by rapidly transitioning to tele-mental health services. Although the majority reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns, only a small subset endorsed offering such services to medical providers. This has implications for future practical directions, as frontline workers may begin to seek mental health treatment related to the pandemic. Despite differences in tele-mental health uptake based on provider characteristics, the majority was interested in continuing to provide such services in the future. This may help to expand clinical services to those in need via tele-mental health beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reilly, Zane, McCuddy, Soulliard, Scarisbrick, Miller, Mahoney Iii","https://doi.org/10.2196/21237","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4873,""
"The Impact of Social Distancing on People with Borderline Personality Disorder: The Views of Dialectical Behavioural Therapists","Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) is an evidence-based treatment for borderline personality disorder and other problems associated with emotional dysregulation. It has traditionally been deployed as a face-to-face programme comprised of attendance at group skills training, individual therapy and phone coaching. Social distancing measures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic led to a cessation of therapeutic programmes in many places. This survey of DBT clinicians in a regional State mental health service in Australia explored the impact of the cessation of DBT programmes in the region and obstacles to engaging with people via online platforms. Clinicians have been able to engage in DBT informed care, but it was perceived that many people have experienced a clinical deterioration or have increased their use of crisis services, which is entirely appropriate, as group skills programmes have ceased. Movement to online platforms of delivery poses problems, as some people do not have the access to internet or privacy in their home environments to engage in online therapy. Ideally, clinicians need to be supported through education, supervision and coaching in the use of telehealth interventions. Social distancing requirements has enabled an opportunity to carefully consider how programmes can be adapted to enable the extension of these programmes to those who have traditionally been unable to access them.","Lakeman, Crighton","https://doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1817208","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4874,""

"Adaptations and Innovations to Minimize Service Disruption for Patients with Severe Mental Illness during COVID-19: Perspectives and Reflections from an Assertive Community Psychiatry Program","Changes to community psychiatry during COVID-19 are unprecedented and without clear guidelines. Minimizing disruption, ensuring quality care to the already vulnerable people with serious mental illness is crucial. We describe and reflect our adaptations and innovations at one community psychiatry program, based on three key principles. In (i) Defining and maintaining essential services while limiting risk of contagion, we discuss such strategies and ways to assess risks, implement infection control, and other creative solutions. In (ii) Promoting health and mitigating physical and mental health impacts, we reflect on prioritizing vulnerable patients, dealing with loss of community resources, adapting group programs, and providing psychoeducation, among others. In (iii) Promoting staff resilience and wellness, we describe building on strength of the staff early, addressing staff morale and avoiding moral injury, and valuing responsive leadership. We also identify limitations and potential further improvements, mindful that COVID-19 and similar crises are likely recurring realities.","Guan, Kirwan, Beder, Levy, Law","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00710-8","20200915","Assertive community treatment team; COVID-19 pandemic; Disaster preparedness; Pandemic preparedness; Severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4876,""
"Changes in network centrality of psychopathology symptoms between the COVID-19 outbreak and after peak","The current study investigated the mechanism and changes in psychopathology symptoms throughout the COVID-19 outbreak and after peak. Two studies were conducted separately in China during outbreak and the after peak stages, with 2540 participants were recruited from February 6 to 16, 2020, and 2543 participants were recruited from April 25 to May 5, 2020. The network models were created to explore the relationship between psychopathology symptoms both within and across anxiety and depression, with anxiety measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and depression measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Symptom network analysis was conducted to evaluate network and bridge centrality, and the network properties were compared between the outbreak and after peak. Noticeably, psychomotor symptoms such as impaired motor skills, restlessness, and inability to relax exhibited high centrality during the outbreak, which still relatively high but showed substantial remission during after peak stage (in terms of strength, betweenness, or bridge centrality). Meanwhile, symptoms of irritability (strength, betweenness, or bridge centrality) and loss of energy (bridge centrality) played an important role in the network after the peak of the pandemic. This study provides novel insights into the changes in central features during the different COVID-19 stages and highlights motor-related symptoms as bridge symptoms, which could activate the connection between anxiety and depression. The results revealed that restrictions on movement were associated with worsen in psychomotor symptoms, indicating that future psychological interventions should target motor-related symptoms as priority.","Wang, Hu, Feng, Wilson, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-00881-6","20200915","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4877,""

"Psychological correlates of COVID-19 pandemic in the Austrian population","COVID-19 poses the greatest challenge for the entire world since the Second World War. Governments are forced to define strict measures to avoid the spreading of the virus, which may further impose psychological burden for the majority of the population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychological distress in Austria during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. From 25 March to 3 April 2020, an anonymous online survey was conducted. Target group included all members of the Austrian population older than 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. The survey addressed the following areas (1) and sociodemographic data, (2) physical and mental health; (3) knowledge and concerns about COVID-19; (4) contact with infected people; (5) prevention efforts; (6) need for further information. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) were used to assess mental health. Analyses were based on 4126 individuals (74% female, age: MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°38.68, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.36). 43.3% rated the psychological impact as moderate (5.6%) or severe (37.7%). 26.5% reported moderate (13.3%) to severe (13.2%) depression; 20.3% moderate (8.9%) to severe (11.4%) anxiety and 21.2% reported to suffer from moderate (10.5%) or severe stress (10.7%). Being female, higher age, lower levels of education, concern about family members, internet as main source of information, student or pupil status, poor self-rated health, and downplaying the seriousness of the problem were significantly associated with higher psychological burden. Protective factors were the possibility to work in home office, frequent (indirect) contact with family or friends, the availability of virus-specific information, confidence in the diagnosis capability, and physical activity during the crisis. This study is among the first in Europe on the psychological correlates of the COVID-19 pandemic. 37.7% of the Austrian study population reported a severe psychological impact on the event and 1 in 10 is considered to suffer from severe depression, anxiety or stress. The present findings inform about the identification of protective factors, psychologically vulnerable groups and may guide the development of psychological interventions.","TraunmÃƒÂ¼ller, Stefitz, Gaisbachgrabner, Schwerdtfeger","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09489-5","20200915","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Psychological status; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4879,""

"Positive and negative mental health outcomes and internal resources among the general population in Greece: A nation-wide survey amid COVID-19 lockdown","Scarce and inconclusive evidence exists on the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown. This study examined the impact (positive and negative) of the lockdown, levels of resilience and use of coping strategies, and identified high-risk groups during the lockdown in Greece (05/04/2020 - 30/04/2020). A sample of 1661 participants (mean age of 39.5Â±12.2 years; 75.5% females) completed a google-forms questionnaire, which was distributed through social networking sites, webpages, and personal contacts. It was found that different population subgroups suffer disproportionately the impact of the lockdown. Healthcare workers, females, younger, less educated, and those living alone reported higher rates of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Females achieved more posttraumatic growth and were using more coping strategies than men. Men, older, healthcare workers, and those with a partner were more resilient. Interventions need to be developed to target personal resources, protect vulnerable populations, facilitate posttraumatic growth, and ameliorate wellbeing and quality of life.","Argyroula Kalaitzaki","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B4-1A4-FED","20200917","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; mental health; posttraumatic outcomes; morbidity; covid-19 outbreak; posttraumatic stress disorder; adaptive and maladaptive coping responses; psychosocial impact; coronavirus","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4881,""
"Cross-Cultural comparisons of psychosocial distress in the USA, South Korea, France, and Hong Kong during the initial phase of COVID-19","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in the worldwide disruption of everyday life but the impact and response to the pandemic have not been uniform. Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the COVID-19; others did not. Whilst social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus, it is also important to examine unintended psychiatric consequences of social isolation. We examined psychological distress in four countries with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental illness. From March to July June 2020, an online survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and increased loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome, although the magnitudes of the effects were not uniform among the four countries. We also observed notable differences in psychological distress; Hong Kong, with the strictest lockdown mandate, suffered the most drastic worsening of mental health outcome. To explain differential exacerbations of psychological distress around the globe during the pandemic, contributions of social unrest, economic uncertainty, and disruption to regular routine should be considered.","Derek Dean et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613D-EF3-CA3","20200916","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; depression; global mental health; social isolation; covid-19; loneliness; anxiety","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-17","",4882,""
