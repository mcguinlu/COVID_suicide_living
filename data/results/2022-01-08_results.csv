"The impact of COVID-19 on addiction treatment in New Zealand","COVID-19 public health measures, including lockdowns, have disrupted psychological service delivery for substance use and behavioural addictions. This study aimed to examine how addictions treatment had been affected by COVID-19 related factors from the perspective of addiction and mental health service providers. Participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 93) were experienced service managers and clinicians in New Zealand who completed an online survey. Clinicians reported increased presentations for problems related to internet gambling (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 57, 61%), gaming (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 53, 57%), social media use (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 52, 56%), and pornography (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 28, 30%). A qualitative analysis of responses generated six themes. Themes included service management and increased administrative burden, and service delivery reconfiguration. Access improved for some clients because of convenience and reduced structural barriers. However, online service delivery was problematic for those with unstable or no internet access and devices that could not support video conferencing and/or lack of safe, confidential or private spaces at home. Increased client complexity and restricted in-person care prompted changes to focus, and content of clinical interventions, and some respondents offered more frequent but shorter appointments. Clinicians who provided services by phone or email, rather than video conferencing, reported treatment was less effective, with reduced rapport and engagement a contributing factor. The New Zealand addictions sector has responded to COVID-19 by increasing treatment access through distance-based options. Maintaining multifaceted models of care that are agile to rapidly changing environments presents unique challenges but is critical to addressing the needs of people impacted by addiction.","Rodda, Park, Wilkinson-Meyers, King","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2021.107230","20220107","Addiction; COVID-19; E-health; Gambling; Substance use; Treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25023,""
"Does perceived post-traumatic growth predict better psychological adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic? Results from a national longitudinal survey in the USA","Perceiving that one has grown in positive ways following highly stressful experiences (perceived posttraumatic growth; PPTG) is common and sometimes--but not always--related to psychological wellbeing. However, PPTG is typically studied cross-sectionally and well after the stressful experience has passed; how PPTG might relate to wellbeing over time in an unprecedented, ongoing worldwide disaster such as the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown. Thus, the current study sought to answer whether, in the midst of the pandemic, PPTG relates to subsequent wellbeing, broadly defined. Participants were NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1544 MTurk workers who completed a five-wave (T1-T5) six-month longitudinal study. Current analyses focused on T2-T5 (nsÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 860-712). At each time point, participants completed self-report measures of PPTG and wellbeing (depression, anxiety, stress, positive states of mind, alcohol use, posttraumatic stress). In cross-lagged panel models, PPTG was largely unrelated to subsequent wellbeing. Somewhat more evidence was found that increasing distress led to increases in PPTG, suggesting perceptions of growth may serve as a coping mechanism. PPTG does not appear to benefit adjustment to the COVID-19 pandemic and may simply reflect efforts to manage distress.","Park, Wilt, Russell, Fendrich","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.12.040","20220107","Adjustment; COVID-19; Coping; Distress: posttraumatic growth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25024,""
"Network analysis of depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents during and after the COVID-19 outbreak peak","This study examined the extent to which the network structure of anxiety and depression among adolescents identified during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic could be cross-validated in a sample of adolescents assessed after the COVID-19 peak. Two cross-sectional surveys were conducted between February 20 and 27, 2020 and between April 11 and 19, 2020, respectively. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using 20-item the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder, respectively. Anxiety-depression networks of the first and second assessments were estimated separately using a sparse Graphical Gaussian Model combined with the graphical least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method. A Network Comparison Test was conducted to assess differences between the two networks. The most central symptoms in the first and second survey networks were Depressed affect and Nervousness. Compared with connections in the first survey network, connections in the second survey network analysis between Relax- Nervousness-Depressive affect-Interpersonal problems (diff, contrast: second survey-first survey. diff=-0.04, P=0.04; diff=-0.03, P=0.03; diff=-0.03, P=0.04), and Irritability-Somatic complaints (diff=-0.04, P=0.02) were weaker while connections of Somatic complaints-Nervousness (diff=0.05, P&lt;0.001), Somatic complaints-Depressive affect (diff=0.03, P=0.009), and Irritability-Control worry-Restlessness (diff=0.02, P=0.03; diff=0.05, P=0.02) were stronger. Depressed affect emerged as a robust central symptom and bridge symptom across Anxiety-Depression networks. Considering the negative impact of depression and anxiety on daily life, timely interventions targeting depressed affect should be implemented to reduce the co-occurrence of anxious and depressed symptoms among adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Chen, Qi, Feng, Su, Cheung, Jackson, Lei, Zhang, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.137","20220107","Adolescent; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Network analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25025,""
"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ideation in a representative Australian population sample: longitudinal cohort study","The direct and indirect mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are considerable. However, it is unclear how suicidal ideation was affected in communities during the acute lockdown phase of the pandemic, and over the longer-term. This study provides longitudinal data on the prevalence of, and risk factors for, suicidal ideation in the Australian national population, during the pandemic. The Australian National COVID-19 Mental Health and Risk Communication Survey assessed a nationally representative sample of Australian adults (NÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1296) fortnightly for 12 weeks from late-March to June 2020 (7 waves), and again in March 2021 (wave 8). Cox proportional hazards models examined demographic and pandemic-related risk factors for suicidal ideation over time. Prevalence of suicidal ideation was high but steady at Ã¢Ë†Â¼18% across the acute lockdown phase of the pandemic, and 16.2% in March 2021. People who had direct experience with COVID-19 (tested, diagnosed, or contact with someone who was diagnosed) had increased risk for suicidal ideation. Higher pandemic-related work and social impairment, recent adversity, loneliness, and being younger were also associated with increased risk of suicidal ideation over time. Both the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 were associated with increased risk for suicidal ideation over time, although prevalence did not vary over time. The high prevalence of suicidal ideation in our sample flag a critical need for accessible mental health support, and provide insight into the factors placing people at risk during the pandemic.","Batterham, Calear, Shou, Farrer, Gulliver, McCallum, Dawel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.01.022","20220107","COVID-19; social support; suicidal ideation; suicide","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25026,""
"Will 'the feeling of abandonment' remain? Persisting impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on rheumatology patients and clinicians","To better understand rheumatology patient and clinician pandemic-related experiences, medical relationships and behaviours in order to help identify the persisting impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, and inform efforts to ameliorate the negative impacts and build-upon the positive ones. Rheumatology patients and clinicians completed surveys (Patients NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1,543, Clinicians NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°111) and interviews (Patients NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41, Clinicians NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32) between April 2021 and August 2021. A cohort (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°139) of systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease patients was also followed-up from March 2020 to April 2021. Analyses used sequential mixed methods. Pre-specified outcome measures included the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental wellbeing score (WEMWBS), satisfaction with care, and healthcare-behaviours. We identified multiple ongoing pandemic-induced/increased barriers to receiving care. The percentage of patients agreeing they were medically supported reduced from 74.4% pre-pandemic to 39.7% during-pandemic. Ratings for medical support, medical-security and trust were significantly (p&lt; 0.001) positively correlated with patient WEMWBS and healthcare-behaviours, and decreased during the pandemic. Healthcare-seeking was reduced, potentially long-term, including from patients feeling 'abandoned' by clinicians, and a 'burden' from Government messaging to protect the NHS. Blame and distrust were frequent, particularly between primary and secondary care, and towards the UK Government, whom &lt;10% of clinicians felt had supported clinicians during the pandemic. Clinicians' efforts were reported to be impeded by inefficient administration systems, and chronic understaffing, suggestive of the pandemic having exposed and exacerbated existing healthcare-system weaknesses. Without concerted action-such as rebuilding trust, improved administrative systems, and more support for clinicians-barriers to care and negative impacts of the pandemic on trust, medical relationships, medical-security and patient help-seeking may persist longer-term. This study is part of a pre-registered longitudinal multi-stage trial, the LISTEN study (ISRCTN-14966097), with later Covid-related additions registered in March 2021, including a pre-registered statistical analysis plan.","Sloan, Harwood, Gordon, Bosley, Lever, Modi, Blane, Brimicombe, Barrere, Holloway, Sutton, D'Cruz","https://doi.org/10.1093/rheumatology/keab937","20220107","Covid-19 pandemic; Healthcare-systems; NHS; Rheumatology; chronic diseases; healthcare behaviours; medical security; mental health; patient-clinician interactions; telemedicine; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25027,""
"Mental health status of informal waste workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh","The deadliest coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is taking thousands of lives worldwide and presents an extraordinary challenge to mental resilience. This study assesses mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among informal waste workers in Bangladesh. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020 among 176 informal waste workers selected from nine municipalities and one city corporation in Bangladesh. General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to assess respondents' mental health. The study found that 80.6% of the individuals were suffering from psychological distress; 67.6% reported anxiety and depression, 92.6% reported social dysfunction, and 19.9% reported loss of confidence. The likelihood of psychological distress (Risk ratio [RR]: 1.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.48) was significantly higher for female than male. Multiple COVID-19 symptoms of the family members (RR: 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.41), unawareness about COVID-19 infected neighbor (RR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.04-1.41), income reduction (RR: 1.60, 95% CI: 1.06-2.41) and daily household meal reduction (RR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.03-1.73) were also found to be associated with psychological distress. These identified factors should be considered in policy-making and support programs for the informal waste workers to manage the pandemic situation as well as combating COVID-19 related psychological challenges.","Haque, Khan, Rahman, Rahman, Begum","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262141","20220107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25028,""
"Viability of an Early Sleep Intervention to Mitigate Poor Sleep and Improve Well-being in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial","The COVID-19 Pandemic led to drastic increases in the prevalence and severity of insomnia symptoms. These increases in insomnia complaints have been paralleled by significant decreases in well-being, including increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and suicidality and decreased quality of life. However, the efficacy and impact of early treatment of insomnia symptoms on future sleep and well-being remains unknown. Here, we present the framework and protocol for a novel feasibility, pilot study that aims to investigate whether a brief telehealth insomnia intervention targeting new insomnia that developed during the pandemic prevents deterioration of well-being, including symptoms of insomnia, depression, anxiety, suicidality, and quality of life. The protocol details a two-arm randomized controlled feasibility trial to investigate the efficacy of a brief, telehealth-delivered, early treatment of insomnia and evaluate its potential to prevent a deterioration of well-being. Participants with clinically significant insomnia symptoms that began during the pandemic are randomized to either a treatment group or a 28-week waitlist control group. Treatment consists of 4 telehealth sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) delivered over 5 weeks. All participants will complete assessments of insomnia symptom severity, well-being, and daily habits checklist at baseline (week 0), and at weeks 1-6, 12, 28, and 56. The trial began enrollment June 3, 2020 and closed enrollment June 17, 2021. As of October 2021, 49 participants have been randomized to either immediate treatment or a 28-week waitlist. 23 participants are still active in the protocol. To our knowledge, this protocol would represent the first study to test an early sleep intervention for improving insomnia that emerged during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The findings of this feasibility study could provide information about the utility of CBT-I for symptoms that emerge in the context of other stressors before they develop a chronic course and deepen understanding of the relationship between sleep and well-being.

"Mental health impact of COVID-19 pandemic among physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers, in the province of Alberta","During the COVID-19 pandemic, threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are evident, particularly among the first responders and the healthcare staff. This study aimed to examine the prevalence and the potential predictors of the likely stress, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder among healthcare workers (HCWs). A cross-sectional survey was used through a survey link sent to gather demographic information and responses on several self-report scales, including the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) among HCWs subscribed to the Text4Hope program. The result from this study suggests that during the COVID-19 pandemic, HCWs reported high likelihood of moderate/high stress (n=840, 81.2%), moderate/severe anxiety (n=369, 38.6%), and depression (n=317, 32.7%) symptoms. Nurses and other HCWs were significantly more likely to report depressive symptoms, compared to physicians, (F (2, 159.47) =15.89, 95% CI= (-5.05) -(-2.04). Younger age groups of HCWs (Ã¢â€°Â¤30 y) were more prone to report likely stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, compared to HCWs 41-50y and &gt;50y (Odd's ratio range: 1.82- 3.03). Similarly, females and those who reported a lack of social support (separated/divorced and single) among HCWs, had a higher likelihood to report likely stress and depressive symptoms, respectively (OR=1.8 and 1.6). This cross-sectional study explored a high level of mental health burdens during the COVID-19 pandemic among HCWs in Alberta. Levels of psychological symptoms were more noticeable in the female gender and the nursing profession.

"Wearable Cortisol Aptasensor for Simple and Rapid Real-Time Monitoring","The necessity of managing stress levels is becoming increasingly apparent as the world suffers from different kinds of stresses including the extent of pandemic, the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Cortisol, a clinically confirmed stress hormone related to depression and anxiety, affects individuals mentally and physically. However, current cortisol monitoring methods require expert personnel, large and complex machines, and long time for data analysis. Here, we present a flexible and wearable cortisol aptasensor for simple and rapid cortisol real-time monitoring. The sensing channel was produced by electrospinning conducting polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers (NFs) and subsequent vapor deposition of carboxylated poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). The conjugation of the cortisol aptamer on the PEDOT-PAN NFs provided the critical sensing mechanism for the target molecule. The sensing test was performed with a liquid-ion gated field-effect transistor (FET) on a polyester (polyethylene terepthalate). The sensor performance showed a detection limit of 10 pM (&lt;5 s) and high selectivity in the presence of interference materials at 100 times higher concentrations. The practical usage and real-time monitoring of the cortisol aptasensor with a liquid-ion gated FET system was demonstrated by successful transfer to the swab and the skin. In addition, the real-time monitoring of actual sweat by applying the cortisol aptasensor was also successful since the aptasensor was able to detect cortisol approximately 1 nM from actual sweat in a few minutes. This wearable biosensor platform supports the possibility of further application and on-site monitoring for changes of other numerous biomarkers.","An, Kim, Park, Seo, Kim, Ha, Bae, Kwon","https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.1c01734","20220107","aptasensor; biosensor; cortisol; flexible; swappable; wearable","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25031,""
"Feasibility of a remotely supervised home-based group eHealth Fitness and Mobility Exercise program for stroke: French-Canadian version preliminary study","The numerous barriers to community-based physical activity programs have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially among individuals with disabilities. eHealth programs may provide an alternative approach to address the physical activity needs of stroke survivors, but little is known about their feasibility or acceptance. The aims of this study were to 1) evaluate the feasibility of a remotely supervised home-based group eHealth program called Fitness and Mobility Exercise (FAME@home); 2) explore the influence of FAME@home on physical condition, mobility, self-efficacy, depression and anxiety; and 3) describe participants' satisfaction and experiences. A pre-post pilot study was used to recruit stroke survivors (&gt;1 y post stroke) to complete a 12-week (2Ã‚Â days/week) eHealth program in small groups (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3). Feasibility indicators were assessed for process (e.g. inclusion criteria), resources (e.g. ability to use technology), management (e.g. major challenges), and treatment (e.g. influence on clinical outcomes and adverse events). Nine participants were recruited with a mean (SD) of 60 (13) years of age and 7 (4) years post-stroke; eight completed the program. FAME@home was feasible for indicators of process, management, and treatment. Minor considerations to improve resources were suggested (i.e. support for technology use). There were statistically significant improvements in mobility after completion of FAME@home and 100% of the participants reported satisfaction. No adverse events occurred. FAME@home was feasible to deliver as a remotely supervised group exercise program to community-dwelling stroke survivors, with high levels of retention and adherence. FAME@home improved accessibility to exercise and facilitated engagement by having a class schedule and social interaction.","Gagnon, SÃƒÂ¨biyo Batcho, Bird, LabbÃƒÂ©, Best","https://doi.org/10.1080/10749357.2021.2012008","20220107","Physical activity; eHealth; mobility; stroke","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25032,""
"Potential joint effects of perceptions related to COVID-19 and future social development on depressive symptoms: a Chinese population-based study","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant negative socio-political, economic, and psychological consequences. To investigate the impact of individual-level (illness representations of COVID-19) and structurally derived (anticipated social-political development in the economy, security, and social harmony in the next year) factors, and their potential moderation effects on depressive symptoms. An anonymous population-based telephone survey was conducted among the general public of Hong Kong, China during 3-10 April 2020 (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°300, response rate 56%). Depressive symptoms were assessed by the validated Chinese version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Of the participants, 8.7% showed probable moderate-to-severe depression. Hierarchical linear regression models showed that illness representations of personal/treatment control and emotional responses and anticipated deterioration in social harmony were independently and significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Anticipated deterioration in security significantly moderated the associations between perceived consequence/treatment control of COVID-19 and depressive symptoms, such that the associations were stronger among people who anticipated a strong deterioration in security. The findings suggested that perceptions of COVID-19 and future social-political development jointly and interactively contributed to depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.

To determine the impact of the pandemic on HCWs, and the relationship between HCW mental health and demographics, occupational factors, and COVID-19 concerns. Cross-sectional survey in an urban medical center (September-November 2020) in Baltimore, MD, in the United States. A total of 605 HCWs (physicians, nurse practitioners, nurses, physician assistants, patient care technicians, respiratory therapists, social workers, mental health therapists, and case managers). Measures of mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire-2, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, PROMIS Sleep Disturbance 4a, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Maslach Burnout Inventory-2 item, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale-2 item), demographics, occupational factors, and COVID-19 related concerns. Fifty-two percent of 1198 HCWs responded to the survey and 14.2% reported depression, 43.1% mild or higher anxiety, 31.6% sleep disturbance, 22.3% posttraumatic stress symptoms, 21.6% depersonalization, 46.0% emotional exhaustion, and 23.1% lower resilience. Relative to HCWs providing in-person care to COVID-19 infected patients none of their working days, those doing so all or most days were more likely to experience worse depression (adjusted odds ratio, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.3-11.7), anxiety (aOR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.3), possible PTSD symptoms (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8), and higher burnout (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.1-6.0).

"""Mourning the Experience of What Should Have Been"": Experiences of Peripartum Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may significantly affect the peripartum experience; however, little is known about the perceptions of women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the purpose of our study was to describe the peripartum experiences of women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Using a cross-sectional design, we collected survey data from a convenience sample of postpartum women recruited through social media. Participants were 18Ã‚Â years of age or older, lived in the United States, gave birth after February 1, 2020, and could read English. This study was part of the COVID-19 Maternal Attachment, Mood, Ability, and Support study, which was a larger study that collected survey data describing maternal mental health and breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper presents findings from the two free-text items describing peripartum experiences. Using the constant comparative method, responses were thematically analyzed to identify and collate major and minor themes. 371 participants responded to at least one free-text item. Five major themes emerged: (1) Heightened emotional distress; (2) Adverse breastfeeding experiences; (3) Unanticipated hospital policy changes shifted birthing plans; (4) Expectation vs. reality: ""mourning what the experience should have been;"" and (5) Surprising benefits of the COVID-19 pandemic to the delivery and postpartum experience.

"Spirituality, Personality, and Emotional Distress During COVID-19 Pandemic in Croatia","This study examined the association between spiritual quality of life (QoL), spiritual coping, emotional distress, and personality during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in a convenience sample of Croatian adults (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,860, 80.6% women). Participants completed an online questionnaire that collected information on sociodemographic characteristics, distress (the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale 21), spiritual coping and spiritual QoL (the WHO Quality of Life-Spirituality, Religiousness, and Personal Beliefs), and personality (the International Personality Item Pool). The hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that personality traits, especially emotional stability, were the most significant predictors of mental health outcomes. Spiritual coping styles were a predictor of worse, while spiritual QoL of better psychological outcomes. Results demonstrate the complex relations between different aspects of spirituality/religiosity with personality and emotional outcomes and suggest that distress motivates the engagement of spiritual coping in times of disaster.","MargetiÃ„â€¡, Peraica, StojanoviÃ„â€¡, Ivanec","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01473-6","20220107","COVID-19 pandemic; Croatia; Emotional distress; Spiritual QoL; Spiritual coping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25036,""
"Changes in Mental Health Among People with HIV During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative and Quantitative Perspectives","People with HIV (PWH) are at risk for adverse mental health outcomes, which could be elevated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study describes reasons for changes in mental health among PWH during the pandemic. Data come from closed- and open-ended questions about mental health changes from a follow-up to a cohort study on PWH in Florida during part of the COVID-19 pandemic (May 2020-March 2021). Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Among the total sample of 227 PWH (mean age 50.0, 49.7% men, 69.2% Black/African American, 14.1% Hispanic/Latino), 30.4% reported worsened mental health, 8.4% reported improved mental health, and 61.2% reported no change. The primary reasons for worsened mental health were concerns about COVID-19, social isolation, and anxiety/stress; reasons for improved mental health included increased focus on individual wellness. Nearly one-third of the sample experienced worsened mental health. These results provide support for increased mental health assessments in HIV treatment settings.","Parisi, Varma, Wang, Vaddiparti, IbaÃƒÂ±ez, Cruz, Cook","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03547-8","20220107","COVID-19; HIV; Mental health; People with HIV (PWH)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25037,""
"Anxiety and depression in patients with advanced cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cancer patients are at increased risk for psychological difficulties and COVID-19. We sought to analyze anxiety and depression levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and the association between sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological factors in patients with advanced cancer. A prospective, multicenter cohort of 401 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, advanced cancer completed the Brief Symptom Inventory, Michel Uncertainty in Illness Scale, Herth Hope Index, and Cancer Worry Scale between February 2020 and May 2021.Ã‚Â Linear regression analyses explored the effects of uncertainty, hopelessness, and cancer worry on anxiety and depression, adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical variables. The incidence of anxiety and depression was 36% and 35%, respectively. Emotional distress was greater among women, patientsÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°65Ã‚Â years of age, and those with an estimated survival ofÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â months. Linear regression analysis revealed that being female, preoccupation about cancer, and hopelessness were associated with increased levels of anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and younger age was associated with a higher risk of anxiety. No differences in anxiety or depression levels were found in relation to marital status, children, educational level, cancer type, histology, stage, or type of treatment. Patients with advanced cancer who initiated treatment during the pandemic experienced high levels of depression and anxiety. Early diagnosis and the development of intervention strategies are necessary, especially for specific patient subgroups, such as young women with long survival times.","Obispo-Portero, Cruz-Castellanos, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Fonseca, Rogado, Hernandez, Castillo-Trujillo, Asensio-MartÃƒÂ­nez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Moya, Carmona-Bayonas, Calderon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06789-3","20220107","Advanced cancer; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Hopelessness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25038,""
"Envisioning Post-pandemic Digital Neurological, Psychiatric and Mental Health Care","The SARS-Cov-2 pandemic placed a dramatic burden on managed healthcare and perhaps nowhere as evident as in neurological and psychiatric disease care. This said, the duration of the pandemic mandated adaptability of the entire care system and the oft-vaunted benefits of telehealth and telemedicine were subjected to deep scrutiny at scale. Positive experiences were reported by both patients and providers from routine check-ups, to use of cognitive behavioral therapy associated with mental disorders, and management of complex diseases such as multiple sclerosis and other neurological and psychiatric conditions. Integration into standard care looks likely in the post pandemic era with many healthcare systems moving to expand reimbursement categories and develop equitable incentive models for developers and providers. In this commentary we share perspective on how the future of care may evolve through hybrid delivery models, and the advent of new therapeutic approaches which can address pain points identified during the pandemic.","Khanna, Jones","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.803315","20220107","COVID telehealth; PTSD; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; multiple sclerosis; neurological disease; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25039,""

"Prevalence and predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder in patients with cured coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) one month post-discharge","<b>Background</b>: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can place an immense psychological strain on the infected patient. The psychological distress can linger after the initial recovery from the infection. <b>Objective</b>: This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and predictors of provisional post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in patients with cured COVID-2019. <b>Methods</b>: The baseline survey was conducted from 10 to 25 February 2020 in patients with COVID-19 in a designated hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics were acquired, and depression and anxiety levels were assessed, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire and 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, respectively. A follow-up survey was conducted 1Ã‚Â month post-discharge. PTSD symptoms were measured by the Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6) and patients' perception of supportive care during hospitalization was investigated using a self-developed questionnaire. <b>Results</b>: In total, 114 patients completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 41 (36.0%) met the cut-off score for provisional PTSD diagnosis according to the IES-6. Female gender [odds ratio (OR)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54-14.37], educational level of high school or below (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 15.49, 95% CI 1.13-212.71), higher anxiety levels (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.34, 95% CI 1.12-1.61) and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.96) predicted a higher risk for provisional PTSD. <b>Conclusions</b>: PTSD is commonly seen in patients with COVID-19 1Ã‚Â month post-discharge. Female patients, and patients with lower educational levels, higher anxiety levels and lower perceptions of emotional support during hospitalization may be more likely to develop PTSD in the near future. Enhancing emotional support during hospitalization could help to prevent PTSD in patients with COVID-19. <b>Antecedentes:</b> El COVID-19 ha supuesto una inmensa carga psicolÃƒÂ³gica para el paciente infectado. El malestar psicolÃƒÂ³gico puede persistir aÃƒÂºn despuÃƒÂ©s de la recuperaciÃƒÂ³n inicial de la infecciÃƒÂ³n.<b>Objetivos:</b> Este estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar la prevalencia y los factores predictores del trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico (TEPT) provisional en pacientes recuperados de COVID-2019.<b>MÃƒÂ©todos:</b> El cuestionario inicial se realizÃƒÂ³ en pacientes con el COVID-19 desde el 10 de febrero del 2020 hasta el 25 de febrero del 2020 en un hospital designado. Se consideraron las variables demogrÃƒÂ¡ficas y clÃƒÂ­nicas, ademÃƒÂ¡s, se evaluaron los niveles de depresiÃƒÂ³n y ansiedad mediante el cuestionario de salud del paciente de 9 elementos y el cuestionario del trastorno de ansiedad generalizada de 7 elementos, respectivamente. Un cuestionario de seguimiento fue realizado un mes despuÃƒÂ©s del alta. Los sÃƒÂ­ntomas de TEPT fueron medidos por el Cuestionario de Eventos de Impacto 6 (IES-6 por sus siglas en ingles) y el nivel de percepciÃƒÂ³n de los pacientes sobre el cuidado de soporte durante la hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n fue investigado utilizando un cuestionario auto-administrado.<b>Resultados:</b> Ciento catorce pacientes completaron tanto el cuestionario inicial como el de seguimiento. Cuarenta y un (36.0%) pacientes cumplieron con el punto de corte para el diagnÃƒÂ³stico provisional de TEPT segÃƒÂºn el IES-6. El sexo femenino (OR = 4.69, 95% CI: 1.54-14.37), un nivel de educaciÃƒÂ³n secundaria o inferior (OR = 15.49, 95% CI: 1.13-212.71), niveles elevados de ansiedad (OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.12-1.61) y una menor percepciÃƒÂ³n de soporte emocional durante la hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n (OR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.17-0.96) fueron factores predictores de riesgo elevado para el desarrollo provisional de TEPT.<b>Conclusiones:</b> El TEPT es observado con frecuencia en pacientes con COVID-19 un mes despuÃƒÂ©s del alta. Las pacientes de sexo femenino, los pacientes con un nivel de educaciÃƒÂ³n bajo, los pacientes con un nivel elevado de ansiedad y una menor percepciÃƒÂ³n de apoyo emocional durante la hospitalizaciÃƒÂ³n podrÃƒÂ­an tener mayor probabilidad de desarrollar TEPT en el futuro cercano.

"Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Parenting Stress Across Asian Countries: A Cross-National Study","<b>Background:</b> In a previous study, we demonstrated that the accumulation of parenting stress during prolonged school closures and restrictions on daily activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan indicates the need for mental health intervention for parents at higher risk of parenting stress. However, few studies have focused on parenting stress in other Asian countries, although they have experienced higher numbers of infections. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether parenting stress among caregivers increased across Asia due to school closures and restrictions on activities during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine whether there were any country-specific, cross-country, or cross-regional risk factors for increased parenting stress. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted an online survey immediately after the number of new cases in India significantly increased (September-November 2020). We measured parenting stress, anxiety, and fear associated with the COVID-19 crisis, as evaluated by the Parenting Stress Index, Short-Form (PSI-SF), and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS), across three Asian countries-India (<i>n</i> = 142), Malaysia (<i>n</i> = 69), and Japan (<i>n</i> = 182)-in addition to the United States (<i>n</i> = 203). We also investigated whether respondents had adverse childhood experiences (ACE) as a risk factor for parenting stress. <b>Results:</b> For all countries, we found significant increases in participants' current parenting stress levels, compared to what they recalled regarding their lives before COVID-19-related restrictions and school closures were enacted. Textual analysis qualitatively identified common terms related to parenting stress across all countries. We also found a statistical model that indicated ACE in parents was a critical risk factor for higher parenting stress <i>via</i> increasing anxiety and fear related to the pandemic. <b>Conclusion:</b> These results indicate the need to improve the mental health of caregivers who are at risk for higher levels of parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Asian countries as well as Western countries. These results indicate that there is a need to improve the mental health of caregivers who are at risk for higher levels of parenting stress during the COVID-19 pandemic globally.","Kurata, Hiraoka, Ahmad Adlan, Jayanath, Hamzah, Ahmad-Fauzi, Fujisawa, Nishitani, Tomoda","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.782298","20220107","Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE); COVID-19; Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS); Parenting Stress Index (PSI); parenting stress; school closure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25042,""
"Comparison of General-Social Health and Corona-Induced Anxiety Between Active and Inactive Students in the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> General health includes physical and mental health and their interactions, and physical activity can improve people's mental and social health. The present study has compared general-social health and COVID-19-induced anxiety between active and inactive students during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> A causal-comparative research design was used in this study. The statistical population consisted of all students of the Farhangian University of Mashhad (2,500 students) in 2020, out of whom 752 students were randomly selected (323 men and 429 women). Subjects were assessed for general health, social health, and COVID-19-induced anxiety. Data normality was investigated by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and data were analyzed statistically using independent <i>t</i>-test and Pearson correlation coefficient test. <b>Results:</b> The results of the present study showed that there was a significant difference between general health and COVID-19-induced anxiety of active and inactive students (<i>p</i> = 0.001), but no significant difference was observed between these two groups in social health (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.05). Results obtained regarding the correlation indicated that there was a significant correlation between general and social health in both active and inactive students (<i>p</i> = 0.001). However, there was no significant correlation between COVID-19-induced anxiety and general-social health (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> According to the results of the present study, it can be said that an active lifestyle and physical activity are important factors to improve general health and reduce anxiety, especially in specific conditions of the COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, it is recommended that students have a regular exercise program to reduce their anxiety and increase the level of their physical health.","Ahmadabadi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.798947","20220107","COVID-19; anxiety; exercise; health; social health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25043,""
"Look After Yourself: Students Consistently Showing High Resilience Engaged in More Self-Care and Proved More Resilient During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted severe restrictions on everyday life to curb the spread of infections. For example, teaching at universities has been switched to an online format, reducing students' opportunities for exchange, and social interaction. Consequently, their self-reported mental health has significantly decreased and there is a pressing need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms-ideally considering not only data collected during the pandemic, but also before. One hundred seventeen German university students aged 18-27 were assessed for known resilience factors (optimism, self-care, social support, generalized self-efficacy) and subsequently completed surveys on stress experiences and mental health every 3 months over a period of 9 months before the outbreak of the pandemic and once during the first lockdown in Germany. For each timepoint before the pandemic, we regressed participants' mental health against the reported stressor load, such that the resulting residuals denote better or worse than expected outcomes, i.e., the degree of resilient functioning. We then tested whether different expressions in the resilience factors were predictive of distinct resilient functioning trajectories, which were identified through latent class growth analysis. Finally, we investigated whether trajectory class, resilience factors, and perceived stress predicted resilience during the pandemic. Results show rather stable resilient functioning trajectories, with classes differing mainly according to degree rather than change over time. More self-care was associated with a higher resilient functioning trajectory, which in turn was linked with the most favorable pandemic response (i.e., lower perceived stress and more self-care). Although findings should be interpreted with caution given the rather small sample size, they represent a rare examination of established resilience factors in relation to resilience over an extended period and highlight the relevance of self-care in coping with real-life stressors such as the pandemic.","Meine, StrÃƒÂ¶mer, SchÃƒÂ¶nfelder, Eckhardt, Bergmann, Wessa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.784381","20220107","COVID-19 pandemic; latent class growth analysis; mental health; resilience; self-care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25044,""

Data were collected from 13 July to 19 August 2020. The participants generally reported moderate CS and BO and low CF. Overall prevalence of mild-to-extremely-severe stress, anxiety and depression was 24.5%, 39.6% and 31.2%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression revealed that moderate-to-high BO and CF correlated with increased risks of mild-to-extremely-severe stress (OR = 4.17 and 2.23, respectively), anxiety (OR = 4.86 and 2.81, respectively) and depression (OR = 5.83 and 3.01, respectively), while moderate-to-high CS correlated with reduced risks of stress (OR = 0.53) and depression (OR = 0.45) only. There were CS and BO differences in groups categorized by marital status and profession. Anxiety increased linearly by seniority &lt;10, 10-19 and Ã¢â€°Â¥20 years (p for trend &lt;0.05). In conclusion, the subscales of ProQOL, BO and CF appeared to be associated with increased risks of stress, anxiety and depression among hospital personnel during the COVID-19 epidemic. A long-term contingency program may be needed to adjust work context variables and support emotional well-being of these workers.","Su, Lo, Wang, Yang, Chang, Huang, Huang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S330533","20220107","Anxiety and Stress Scale; COVID-19; DASS-21; ProQoL; depression; hospital personnel; professional quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25045,""
"Erectile dysfunction among patients and health care providers during COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review","COVID-19 pandemic is associated with devastating effects on social, psychological, and economical aspects of survivors. We assume that erectile function (EF) is affected as well. We performed a systematic review of the published articles about the change in EF among patients and health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed and Cochrane databases for English literature using a combination of medical subject headings (MeSH) terms and keywords. We extracted data of erectile dysfunction (ED) rate, international index of erectile function (IIEF), changes related to exposure to the pandemic (Primary objectives), and factors affecting these differences (Secondary objectives). Twenty articles were included in the screening phase. Only 3 articles were eligible for primary objectives, and 2 articles were included for the secondary objective. Three articles revealed an increase in ED cases and a reduction in IIEF-5 scores during the pandemic. Rates of ED have ranged from 32% to 87% of the study populations. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were associated with increased ED rates. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased rates of ED. Anxiety and depression augment this increase. Health care providers are at higher risk for PTSD, which increases the risk of ED.","Bakr, El-Sakka","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41443-021-00504-w","20220107","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25046,""
"Effectiveness and feasibility of telerehabilitation in patients with COVID-19: a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis","Respiratory rehabilitation is the use of exercise, education, and behavioural interventions to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. Recent studies highlight that respiratory rehabilitation is effective and safe for patients with COVID-19. We aim to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of respiratory telerehabilitation on patients infected with COVID-19 by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases will be searched from inception to the end of November 2021. Randomised controlled trials investigating the effectiveness of telerehabilitation in the management of COVID-19 will be included. The primary outcomes will be functional capacity, cardiopulmonary exercise tests and quality of life. Secondary outcomes will include anxiety/depression level, sleep quality, mortality rate, completion rate, reason for withdrawal, adverse events, service satisfaction, cost-effectiveness and other potential factors. Two reviewers will independently screen and extract data and perform quality assessment of included studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool will be used to assess risk of bias. Review Manager V.5.4 (Cochrane Collaboration) software will be used for statistical analysis. Heterogeneity will be analysed using IÃ‚Â² statistics. Mean difference or standardised mean difference with 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI and p value will be used to calculate treatment effect for outcome variables. Ethical approval is not required because this systematic review and meta-analysis is based on previously published data.

"Risk Factors for COVID-19 in College Students Identified by Physical, Mental, and Social Health Reported During the Fall 2020 Semester: An Observational Study Using the Roadmap app and Fitbit Wearable Sensors","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic triggered a seismic shift in education, to online learning. With nearly 20 million students enrolled in colleges across the U.S., the long-simmering mental health crisis in college students was likely further exacerbated by the pandemic. This study leveraged mobile health (mHealth) technology and sought to: i) characterize self-reported outcomes of physical, mental, and social health by COVID-19 status; ii) assess physical activity through consumer-grade wearable sensors (FitbitÃ‚Â®); and iii) identify risk factors associated with COVID-19 positivity in a population of college students prior to release of the vaccine. Detailed methods were previously published in JMIR Res Protocols (Cislo et al). After completing a baseline assessment (i.e., Time 0 [T0]) of demographics, mental, and social health constructs through the Roadmap 2.0 app, participants were instructed to use the app freely, to wear the FitbitÃ‚Â®, and complete subsequent assessments at T1, T2 and T3, followed by a COVID-19 assessment of history and timing of COVID-19 testing and diagnosis (T4: ~14 days after T3). Continuous measures were described using means (M) and standard deviations (SD), while categorical measures were summarized using frequencies and proportions. Formal comparisons were made based on COVID-19 status. The multivariate model was determined by entering all statistically significant variables (P&lt;.05) in univariable associations at once and then removing one variable at a time by backward selection until the optimal model was obtained. During the fall 2020 semester, 1,997 participants consented, enrolled, and met criteria for data analyses. There was a high prevalence of anxiety, as assessed by the State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI), with moderate and severe levels in N=465 (24%) and N=970 (49%) students, respectively. Approximately, one-third of students reported having a mental health disorder (N=656, 33%). The average daily steps recorded in this student population was approximately 6500 (M=6474, SD=3371). Neither reported mental health nor step count were significant based on COVID-19 status (P=.52). Our analyses revealed significant associations of COVID-positivity with use of marijuana and alcohol (P =.020 and .046, respectively) and lower belief in public health measures (P=.003). In addition, graduate students were less likely and those with Ã¢â€°Â¥20 roommates were more likely to report a COVID-19 diagnosis (P=.009). Mental health problems were common in this student population. Several factors, including substance use, were associated with risk of COVID-19. These data highlight important areas for further attention, such as prioritizing innovative strategies that address health and well-being, considering the potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on college students.

"Mental health status of COVID-19 survivors: a cross sectional study","Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a communicable disease caused by a virus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pandemics are associated with the high level of mental stress. In many countries, general people reported the high level of depression, anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic stress disorder during recent a pandemic. This study aims to investigate the mental health status of people who survived through this alarming situation of COVID-19. In this study, seventy individuals (either gender) between the age of 18-60Ã‚Â years, who contracted COVID-19 previously and then recovered as indicated by negative PCR results, were included. Data was collected by using three tools: impact of event scale (IES-R), patient health questionnaire-9(PHQ-9) and corona anxiety scale (CAS). People with other systemic/mental disorders, ongoing malignancies, upper/lower motor disorders and inability to give consent were excluded from the study. Mean age of participants was 26.29Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.79. All the 70 responders suffered from COVID-19. Among these 23 (32.9%) were asymptomatic and 47(67.1%) had common symptoms related to COVID-19 53 (75.7%) responders also had symptoms post-recovery. Most of the people who suffered COVID-19 had mild depression. Twenty-nine participants (41.4%) reported the highest impact of this traumatic event on their mental health. After suffering from COVID-19, 74.3% reported no anxiety as measured through corona anxiety scale (CAS). High level of post-traumatic stress was seen among participants who recovered from COVID-19, especially those patients who were symptomatic. Mild depression and anxiety were also noted among them.","Jafri, Zaheer, Fatima, Saleem, Sohail","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-021-01729-3","20220107","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25049,""
"The new frontline: exploring the links between moral distress, moral resilience and mental health in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, confront healthcare workers (HCW) with increased exposure to potentially morally distressing events. The pandemic has provided an opportunity to explore the links between moral distress, moral resilience, and emergence of mental health symptoms in HCWs. A total of 962 Canadian healthcare workers (88.4% female, 44.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) completed an online survey during the first COVID-19 wave in Canada (between April 3rd and September 3rd, 2020). Respondents completed a series of validated scales assessing moral distress, perceived stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, and moral resilience. Respondents were grouped based on exposure to patients who tested positive for COVID-19. In addition to descriptive statistics and analyses of covariance, multiple linear regression was used to evaluate if moral resilience moderates the association between exposure to morally distressing events and moral distress. Factors associated with moral resilience were also assessed. Respondents working with patients with COVID-19 showed significantly more severe moral distress, anxiety, and depression symptoms (FÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â 5.5, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .020), and a higher proportion screened positive for mental disorders (Chi-squared &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.1, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002), compared to healthcare workers who were not. Moral resilience moderated the relationship between exposure to potentially morally distressing events and moral distress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001); compared to those with higher moral resilience, the subgroup with the lowest moral resilience had a steeper cross-sectional worsening in moral distress as the frequency of potentially morally distressing events increased. Moral resilience also correlated with lower stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms (rÃ‚Â &gt;Ã‚Â .27, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Factors independently associated with stronger moral resilience included: being male, older age, no mental disorder diagnosis, sleeping more, and higher support from employers and colleagues (B [0.02, |-0.26|]. Elevated moral distress and mental health symptoms in healthcare workers facing a global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic call for the development of interventions promoting moral resilience as a protective measure against moral adversities.","Spilg, Rushton, Phillips, Kendzerska, Saad, Gifford, Gautam, Bhatla, Edwards, Quilty, Leveille, Robillard","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03637-w","20220107","Anxiety; Depression; Global crisis; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Moral distress; Moral resilience; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25050,""
"Association of Covid-19 pandemic-related stress and depressive symptoms among international medical students","The outbreak of Covid-19 had negative impacts on the mental stress and induced psychological distress among university students worldwide. This study proposed a moderated mediation model, and hypothesized that the Covid-19 pandemic-related stress was positively related to depressive symptoms among international medical students. An online survey on stress and depressive symptoms of international students was conducted in a medical university. Questions on Covid-19 pandemic-related stress, Patient Health Quesionnaire-9, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire and the Perceived Social Support Scale were used as measurements, and model analyses were conducted using Hayes' PROCESS macro for SPSS. It was found that 9.83%, 3.08% and 2.12% students had mild, moderate and severe depressive symptoms, respectively, and the positive association between Covid-19 pandemic-related stress and depressive symptoms was significant (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.27, tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.87, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Negative coping was also significantly correlated to depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26, tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.60, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), and partially mediated the association between Covid-19 pandemic-related stress and depressive symptoms. Perceived social support had a negative association with depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²=-0.26, t=-6.25, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), played a negative moderating role in the relationship between negative coping and depressive symptoms, and moderated the indirect effect of Covid-19 pandemic-related stress on depressive symptoms via negative coping. Results of the study suggested that under the background of continuing pandemic, intervention or prevention of mental health problem is urgently needed for the international students, and depression may be alleviated through reducing negative coping and increasing perceived social support.","Lu, Wang, Wang, Guo, Pan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-021-03671-8","20220107","Coping style; Covid-19; Depressive symptoms; Perceived social support; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25051,""
"Emerging Opportunities to Improve Treatment Access for Substance Use Disorders and Other Comorbid Health Issues Among Women Enrolled in WIC","Women living in underserved communities are at an increased risk for substance use disorders and other comorbid health issues, a public health concern that was exacerbated as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. In response to the challenges the pandemic presented, services delivered by the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) adapted nimbly, including WIC nutrition managers' and counselors' efforts to provide reactive referrals of clients raising concern about substance misuse and related consequences. This adaptation signaled an opportunity to consider integrating more proactive, evidence-based strategies for substance use disorders such as standardized brief assessments, advice, and referral procedures (i.e., Screening, Brief Interventions, and Referral to Treatment [SBIRT]), as part of routine WIC operations. Integration of such routine practice would improve the quality of care WIC provides to their clients and families, while addressing a major gap in public health by connecting clients at high risk for substance use disorders and substance-related problems to much needed services. Given the adaptability of WIC to reactively manage the wide array of psychosocial and mental health problems that increased during the pandemic, opportunities exist for future research to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of proactive implementation of brief screening, advice, and treatment referral to reduce substance-related harm among women living in underserved communities.","Washio, Collins, Kilby","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399211069094","20220107","COVID-19; SBIRT; WIC; comorbid health; substance use disorders; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25052,""
"Behavioral Health Diagnoses and Health Care Use Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emerging evidence has suggested a population-wide worsening of psychiatric symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among individuals with preexisting mental health conditions. The authors investigated whether reported behavioral health problems are being identified and treated. This observational cohort study retrospectively compared Medicaid data of patients from the first year of the pandemic (2020) in the United States (N=1,589,111 patients) with the corresponding data from the year before (2019; N=1,715,872 patients). Outcome measures included several behavioral health diagnoses and health care utilization. During the pandemic period examined, the numbers of patients served, adults receiving a new diagnosis of anxiety, and children receiving a new diagnosis of depression all increased. Across all age groups, nonbehavioral health emergency department visits significantly decreased. These findings support reports of increases in psychiatric morbidity but do not provide evidence for increased demand for health care services.","Valdes, Gorman, Ren, Bowling, Steiner, Bethea, Aamar, Andel, Reist","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100133","20220107","Anxiety disorders; Behavioral health; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-01-08","",25053,""
