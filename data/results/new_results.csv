"Depression, Anxiety and Depression-anxiety comorbidity amid COVID-19 Pandemic: An online survey conducted during lockdown in Nepal","Background: Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health status during the lock-down period. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety. Awareness interventions to promote mental well-being need to be integrated into the response interventions. Community mental health care should be made accessible to at-risk groups.","Sigdel, A.; Bista, A.; Bhattarai, N.; Poon, B.

"Three CoViD-19 Mortality Indicators for Temporal and International Comparisons","In response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) pandemic, national and local institutions have issued public-health orders to slow the spread of the disease. Comparing CoViD-19 trends over time and place may thus provide important public health insights about the impact of different strategies. To aid these comparisons, we illustrate the properties of three comparative indicators of CoViD-19 mortality using estimates and projections for the world most affected areas. We first demonstrate how a Crude CoViD-19 Death Rate (CCDR) incorporates the temporal dimension of CoViD-19 mortality. We also show how the advantage of the indirectly age-standardized Comparative CoViD-19 Mortality Ratio (CCMR). Finally, we calculate declines in life expectancy at birth that translate CoViD-19 mortality projections into an easily interpretable metric. Projections used to illustrate this yields a .3 of a year decline in life expectancy at birth for the U.S.A., for instance, which would be comparable to the decline in life expectancy at birth between 1992 and 1993 (AIDS mortality) and between 2014 and 2017 (opioid-overdose mortality). Data about the pandemic are changing too rapidly to draw any conclusion from the current values of the indicators, however, and there are multiple reasons to expect upward revisions of these projections.","Heuveline, P.; Tzen, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20085506v1?rss=1""","20200505",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health Status of the General Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional National Survey in Japan","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have detrimental mental health consequences. However, as yet, there is limited understanding of its impact on the mental health of the general population. The aim of this study is to examine the mental health of the Japanese general population by conducting the first systematic survey during the pandemic (N=1,000), with a particular focus on identifying the most vulnerable groups. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that the mental health of young and middle-aged individuals was significantly worse than that of older individuals during the pandemic. There was also some indication that individuals who were not currently working were significantly more likely to report a high level of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Part-time and temporary contract-based workers were also more likely to suffer from anxiety disorder. Our results highlight that monitoring the mental health of younger and economically vulnerable individuals may be especially important. In addition, they also indicate that population mental health might not only be affected by the direct health consequences of COVID-19, but also by the economic ramifications of the pandemic.","Ueda, M.; Stickley, A.; Sueki, H.; Matsubayashi, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082453v1?rss=1""","20200503",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Simulating a community mental health service during the COVID-19 pandemic: effects of clinician-clinician encounters, clinician-patient-family encounters, symptom-triggered protective behaviour, and household clustering","Background. Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing ""external"" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","Cardinal, R. N.; Meiser-Stedman, C.

"Psychological Stress and Gender Differences during COVID-19 Pandemic in Chinese Population","Background The COVID-19 disease has been spreading for more than four months in China and been pronounced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As an urgent public health crisis, it has severe physical and psychological impacts on human. The related experience and mental health on individuals and society during the pandemic can be devastating and has lasting impact. Objective To investigate the psychological stress and gender difference responding to the threat of COVID-19 and relevant factors. Methods A cross-sectional population-based study using online questionnaires via a social media software, WeChat, from 20th to 27th Feb, 2020. Psychological stress was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). The relevant factors included demographics, the epidemic and living status characteristics related to COVID-19, psychological status, the needs of psychological support services, and psychological resilience. Psychological responses to depression, anxiety were also measured. Results Total 3088 questionnaires from 32 provinces in China were collected online. The average score of psychological stress was 3.4. The risk factors related to psychological stress included: female, [&le;]45 years old, higher education, farmer/worker/clerical and business/service, unemployed, more diseases, uncertainty local epidemic status, close contact or completed a medical observation, higher desire for knowledge about the COVID-19, the diseases, psychological, economic difficulties during the epidemic. The protect factors included: frequently contacting with colleagues, calm mood, and high psychological resilience. There were gender differences on stress, the adaption to current living/working status, the coping strategy for heating, and the psychological support service needs. Conclusion The stress, anxiety and depression were mainly related to gender, age, education, and occupation during the epidemic of COVID-19. It suggested that we should make appropriate control measures and provide different psychological supports according to different population characteristics.","Song, K.; Li, T.; Luo, D.; Hou, F.; Bi, F.; Stratton, T.

"When the storm is the strongest: The health conditions and job satisfaction of Healthcare staff and their associated predictors during the epidemic peak of COVID-19","This study reports the physical health, mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, and job satisfaction of healthcare staff in Iran when the country faced its highest number of total active COVID-19 cases. In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China. This study helps to identify the healthcare staff in need to enable more targeted help as healthcare staff in many countries are facing peaks in their COVID-19 cases.","Zhang, S.

"Mental Health of Clinical Staff Working in High-Risk Epidemic and Pandemic Health Emergencies: A Rapid Review of the Evidence and Meta-Analysis","The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","Bell, V.; Wade, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082669v1?rss=1""","20200502",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions","Although some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on individual mental health is still nascent. This study uses typhoon eye theory to offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during COVID-19 outbreak. We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan. The distance of individual adults to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001). Our results that well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, our results indicate the practitioners should be cautious of using typhoon eye effect for individuals who were older or had a larger family size.","Tang, P. M.; Zhang, S. X.; Li, C.

"Coronavirus Infection and PARP Expression Dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: A Potentially Actionable Component of Innate Immunity","SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV) and cause of COVID-19, which is much more lethal in older people and those with comorbid conditions for unknown reasons. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.

Impact statementSpecific disturbances in the NAD gene set, NAD metabolome and PARP activity were discovered as a defining feature of coronavirus infection that may lead to methods to boost innate immunity.","Heer, C.

"COVID-19 News Exposure as a Modifiable Risk Factor of Psychological Symptoms: Can an Official WhatsApp Channel Help?","BACKGROUND: In a global pandemic, digital technology offers innovative methods to disseminate public health messages  As an example, the messenger application WhatsApp was adopted by both the World Health Organization and government agencies to provide updates on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)  During a time when rumours and excessive news threaten psychological well-being, these services allow for rapid transmission of information and may boost resilience  OBJECTIVE: In this study, we sought to: (1) assess well-being during the pandemic;(2) replicate prior findings linking exposure to COVID-19 news with psychological distress;and (3) examine whether subscription to an official WhatsApp channel can mitigate this risk  METHODS: Across 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak (7 March - 21 April 2020), we conducted a survey of 1145 adults in Singapore  As the primary outcome measure, participants completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21)  As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news;(2) their use of the Singapore government's WhatsApp channel;and (3) their demographics  RESULTS: Within the sample, 7 9% of participants had severe or extremely severe symptoms on at least one DASS-21 subscale  Depression scores were associated with increased duration spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b = - 07, t(863) = -2 04, P = 0 04)  Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumours, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government's WhatsApp messages (b = - 05, t(863) = -2 13, P = 0 03)  Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the duration spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use  CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium to disseminate pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly  In turn, this use may promote public well-being amidst an 'infodemic'  CLINICALTRIAL: ClinicalTrials gov NCT04305574","Liu, Jean Cj; Tong, Eddie Mw","https://doi.org/10.2196/22142",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: 1.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Most patients preferred to resume treatment given the chance regardless of background characteristics;higher self-mastery and greater perceived social support were associated with lower distress, while feeling helpless was associated with higher distress  WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Infertility diagnosis and treatment frequently result in significant psychological distress  Recently published data has shown that clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a sharp increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among infertile patients undergoing IVF and was perceived as an uncontrollable and stressful event  Personal resources play an important protective role in times of crisis, helping reduce levels of distress  STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional questionnaire study included patients whose fertility treatment was suspended following the COVID-19 pandemic, in a tertiary hospital  The survey was delivered to 297 patients within 12 days at the beginning of April 2020  PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The self-administered questionnaire included items addressing: 1  patients' demographic characteristics, 2  anxiety related to COVID-19 infection risk and level of social support, 3  patients' perceptions of the new guidelines and description of subsequently related emotions, and 4  two validated scales assessing levels of emotional distress and self-mastery  Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess factors alleviating or increasing emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic  MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: There were 168 patients who completed the survey, giving a response rate of 57%  Study variables in the regression model explained 38 9% of the variance in psychological distress experienced by patients during treatment suspension  None of the background characteristics (e g  age, marital status, parity, economic level or duration of treatments) had a significant contribution  Feeling helpless following the suspension of treatments was associated with higher distress (P &lt; 0 01)  Higher self-mastery and greater perceived social support were associated with lower distress (p &lt; 0 01)  Despite the ministry of health's decision, 72% of patients wished to resume treatment at the time of survey  LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This was a cross-sectional study, thus information about patients' characteristics prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was not available  The length and implications of this pandemic are unknown  Therefore, the ability to draw conclusions about the psychological consequences of the crisis is limited at this point of time  WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Personal resources play an important protective role in times of crisis, helping to reduce levels of distress  Study <U+FB01>ndings suggest that attention should be paid to strengthening and empowering patients' personal resources together with directly confronting and containing feelings of helplessness  In line with the ESHRE guidelines, especially at this time of high levels of distress, it is imperative to offer emotional support to reduce stress and concerns  Furthermore, as the pandemic is stabilising, resumption of treatment should be considered as soon as appropriate according to local conditions  STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This study was funded by the IVF unit of the Shamir Medical Center  All authors declare no conflicts of interest","Ben-Kimhy, Reut; Youngster, Michal; Medina-Artom, Tamar R.; Avraham, Sarit; Gat, Itai; Haham, Lilach Marom; Hourvitz, Ariel; Kedem, Alon","https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deaa248",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: 1.

"STRESS AND SYMPTOM BURDEN IN ONCOLOGY PATIENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","Context No information is available on oncology patients’ level of stress and symptom burden during the COVID-19 pandemic  We evaluated for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, levels of social isolation and loneliness, and the occurrence and severity of common symptoms between oncology patients with low versus high levels of COVID-19 and cancer-related stress  In addition, we determined which of these characteristics were associated with membership in the high stressed group  Methods – Patients were &gt;18 years of age;had a diagnosis of cancer;and were able to complete an online survey  Results Of the 187 patients in this study, 31 6% were categorized in the stressed group (Impact of Event Scale –Revised (IES-R score of &gt;24))  Stressed group’s IES-R score exceeds previous benchmarks in oncology patients and equates with probable PTSD  In this stressed group, patients reported occurrence rates for depression (71 2%), anxiety (78 0%), sleep disturbance (78 0%), evening fatigue (55 9%), cognitive impairment (91 5%), and pain (75 9%)  Symptom severity scores equate with clinically meaningful levels for each symptom  Conclusions – We identified alarmingly high rates of stress and an extraordinarily high symptom burden among cancer patients, exceeding those previously benchmarked in this population and on par with non-cancer patients with PTSD  Given that the COVID19 pandemic will likely impact cancer care for an indefinite period of time, clinicians must exhibit increased vigilance in their assessments of patients’ level of stress and symptom burden  Moreover, an increase in referrals to appropriate supportive care resources must be prioritized for high risk patients","Miaskowski, Christine; Paul, Steven M.; Snowberg, Karin; Abbott, Maura; Borno, Hala; Chang, Susan; Chen, Lee May; Cohen, Bevin; Hammer, Marilyn J.; Kenfield, Stacey A.; Kober, Kord M.; Levine, Jon D.; Pozzar, Rachel; Rhoads, Kim F.; Van Blarigan, Erin L.; Van Loon, Katherine","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2020.08.037",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: 1.

"COVID-19 anxiety among front-line nurses: Predictive role of organisational support, personal resilience and social support","AIM: This study examines the relative influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety in front-line nurses. BACKGROUND: Anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses' well-being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus-related anxiety among front-line nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety among nurses. METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardized scales. RESULTS: Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support (ß = -0.142, p = .011), personal resilience (ß = -0.151, p = .008) and organisational support (ß = -0.127, p = .023) predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID-19. IMPLICATION FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: COVID-19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience-promoting and stress management interventions.","Labrague, Leodoro J; De Los Santos, Janet Alexis A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13121",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Nurs Manag;2020 Aug 08.; Publication details: J Nurs Manag;2020 Aug 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Drinking to Cope During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of External and Internal Factors in Coping Motive Pathways to Alcohol Use, Solitary Drinking, and Alcohol Problems","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life  Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms  Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions  This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic  METHODS: Participants (N = 320;54 7% male;mean age of 32 years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period beginning within 1 month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response  RESULTS: The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively)  Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives  Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported  CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic","Wardell, Jeffrey D.; Kempe, Tyler; Rapinda, Karli K.; Single, Alanna; Bilevicius, Elena; Frohlich, Jona R.; Hendershot, Christian S.; Keough, Matthew T.","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14425",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research;2020.; Publication details: Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Future perspective: high-throughput construction of new ultrasensitive cytokine and virion liquid chips for high-throughput screening (HTS) of anti-inflammatory drugs or clinical diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases","Pathogen-host cell interactions play an important role in many human infectious and inflammatory diseases  Several pathogens, including Escherichia coli (E  coli), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M  tb), and even the recent 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), can cause serious breathing and brain disorders, tissue injury and inflammation, leading to high rates of mortality and resulting in great loss to human physical and mental health as well as the global economy  These infectious diseases exploit the microbial and host factors to induce serious inflammatory and immunological symptoms  Thus the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting bacterial/viral infection is an urgent need  In previous studies, YojI-IFNAR2, YojI-IL10RA, YojI-NRP1,YojI-SIGLEC7, and YojI-MC4R membrane-protein interactions were found to mediate E  coli invasion of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which activated the downstream anti-inflammatory proteins NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2(NLRP2), using a proteomic chip conjugated with cell immunofluorescence labeling  However, the studies of pathogen (bacteria/virus)-host cell interactions mediated by membrane protein interactions did not extend their principles to broad biomedical applications such as 2019-nCoV infectious disease therapy  The first part of this feature article presents in-depth analysis of the cross-talk of cellular anti-inflammatory transduction signaling among interferon membrane protein receptor II (IFNAR2), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10RA), NLRP2 and [Ca(2+)]-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2G5), based on experimental results and important published studies, which lays a theoretical foundation for the high-throughput construction of the cytokine and virion solution chip  The paper then moves on to the construction of the novel GPCR recombinant herpes virion chip and virion nano-oscillators for profiling membrane protein functions, which drove the idea of constructing the new recombinant virion and cytokine liquid chips for HTS of leading drugs  Due to the different structural properties of GPCR, IFNAR2, ACE2 and Spike of 2019-nCoV, their ligands will either bind the extracellular domain of IFNAR2/ACE2/Spike or the specific loops of the GPCR on the envelope of the recombinant herpes virions to induce dynamic charge distribution changes that lead to the variable electron transition for detection  Taken together, the combined overview of two of the most innovative and exciting developments in the immunoinflammatory field provides new insight into high-throughput construction of ultrasensitive cytokine and virion liquid chips for HTS of anti-inflammatory drugs or clinical diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases including infectious diseases, acute or chronic inflammation (acute gouty arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, atheromatosis, diabetes, obesity, tissue injury and tumors  It has significant value in the prevention and treatment of these serious and painful diseases  Graphical abstract","Feng, Yingzhu; Huang, Jiuhong; Qu, Chuanhua; Huang, Mengjun; Chen, Zhencong; Tang, Dianyong; Xu, Zhigang; Wang, Bochu; Chen, Zhongzhu","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-020-02894-0",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry;2020.; Publication details: Analytical and bioanalytical chemistry;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Symptoms of Anxiety, Depression and Peritraumatic Dissociation in Critical Care Clinicians Managing COVID-19 Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study","RATIONALE: Frontline healthcare providers (HCPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic are at high risk of mental morbidity  OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation in HCPs  METHODS: Cross-sectional study in 21 ICUs in France between April 20 and May 21, 2020  The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used  Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified  MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Response rate was 67%, with 1058 respondents (median age 33 y, 71% women, 68% nursing staff)  The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50 4%, 30 4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses  By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (Odds Ratio of 0 58(0 42-0 79), 0 57(0 39-0 82) and 0 49(0 34-0 72), respectively  HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation  Importantly, we identified six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions  CONCLUSIONS: HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 epidemic  Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms  This article is open access and distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives License 4 0 (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4 0/)","Azoulay, Elie; Cariou, Alain; Bruneel, Fabrice; Demoule, Alexandre; Kouatchet, Achille; Reuter, Danielle; Souppart, Virginie; Combes, Alain; Klouche, Kada; Argaud, Laurent; Barbier, François, Jourdain; Mercé, Reignier, Jean; Papazian, Laurent; Guidet, Bertrand; Géri, Guillaume; Resche-Rigon, Matthieu; Guisset, Olivier; Labbé, Vincent, Mégarbane, Bruno; Van Der Meersch, Guillaume; Guitton, Christophe; Friedman, Diane; Pochard, Frederic; Darmon, Michael; Kentish-Barnes, Nancy","https://doi.org/10.1164/rccm.202006-2568OC",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;2020.; Publication details: American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Ethical perspectives on the management of COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on mental health","As an essential component of medical work throughout history, Ethics becomes even more prominent in public health emergency situations  After presenting the fundamental ethical principles, and emphasizing their value in the medical care of every human being, the inevitable tensions that their application generates in the diverse contexts of the doctor-patient relationship, are examined  Particular attention must be paid to the distinctions between ethical perspectives of individual cases and those related to public health situations such as the massive emergency triggered by the COVID-1 pandemic  On the basis of recent national and international documents, the unavoidable upcoming of new ethical norms that must include socio-cultural, psychological and legal aspects of a highly significant clinical impact, is discussed","Alarcón-Guzmán, R.

0 01)  The rates of high and very high suicide risk, severe sleep problems, severe or extremely severe anxiety, and severe or extremely severe depression were also significantly higher in the case group (9 57%, 12 23%, 4 79% and 7 98%, respectively) than in the control group (3 79%, 1 80%, 0 80% and 1 80%, respectively;P &lt; 0 01)  <U+2461>The total scores of suicide risk, PSQI, SAS, and SDS and the factor scores of PSQI were all higher in the case group than in the control group (P &lt; 0 01)  <U+2462>The total scores of suicide risk, SAS, SDS, PSQI and the factor scores of PSQI were all positively correlated in COVID-19 patients, and the total score of suicide risk was also positively correlated with age  <U+2463>Sleep problems, anxiety, depression and age entered the regression equation with suicide risk as dependent variables  Conclusion Patients with COVID-19 have severe sleep and psychological problems, which contribute to a high suicide risk of the patients  Age, anxiety, depression and poor sleep quality were all risk factors for a high suicide risk in COVID-19 patients, and among them poor sleep quality was the most significant risk factor;

"The Investigation and Analysis of 14034 College Students on COVID-19 and its Countermeasures and Suggestions; 14034<U+540D><U+5927><U+5B66><U+751F><U+5BF9><U+65B0><U+51A0><U+80BA><U+708E><U+77E5><U+4FE1><U+884C><U+8C03><U+67E5><U+5206><U+6790><U+53CA><U+5BF9><U+7B56><U+5EFA><U+8BAE>","Objective: To understand the current situation of college students' knowledge, cognitive attitude and behavior (KAP)towards the prevention and control of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Corona Virus Disease 2019, COVID-19) during the epidemic, so as to provide theoretical basis for college students' resumption of study and campus prevention and control  Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted among 16,410 college students by using the convenient sampling method of, One-Way ANOVA and Logistic regression analysis of the survey data  Results: The total awareness rate of college students on COVID-19 was 85%, the average knowledge score was (70 4±10 0), and the proportion of high cognition was 74 5%  The average attitude score of college students was (3 78±0 55), and only 3 9% of them held a positive attitude  The average score of college students' protective behaviors was (19 35±1 69), and 48 8% of them took good protective behaviors  Binary logistic regression analysis showed that the proportion of students with high cognition who adopt good protective behaviors is higher than that of students with low cognition (95%CI: 0 621-0 752)  The proportion of students with a positive attitude to adopt good behaviors was higher than that with a negative attitude (95%CI: 1 398-2 009), Spearman rank correlation analysis results showed that there was a weak positive correlation between cognition and attitude (r=0 056,P &lt; 0 05), and a weak positive correlation between cognition and behavior (r=0 118,P &lt; 0 05), and a weak positive correlation between attitude and behavior (r=0 038,P &lt; 0 05)  Conclusion: College students have a good overall cognition of COVID-19, but their attitudes and protective behaviors need to be further improved  Therefore, knowledge education, behavioral intervention and psychological counseling on COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control among college students should be strengthened to improve their prevention and control ability and physical quality;

"Potentially inappropriate medication and associated factors such as depression and dementia: An analysis of middle-aged and elderly people; Prevalência de medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados e fatores associados, como depressão e demência: uma análise de pessoas de meia-idade e idosos","AIMS: To establish the frequency potentially inappropriate medications use and the associated factors, such as signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit among middle-aged and elderly people. METHODS: A cross-sectional population study was performed with 2,350 people, aged between 55-103 years, registered in the primary health care. Potentially inappropriate medications were defined by updated 2019 Beers criteria. Studied variables were sociodemographic, lifestyle and health, and signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit. Multinomial regression analysis was executed. RESULTS: The frequency of potentially inappropriate medications use was 65.4%. Former and current smokers, regular self-perception of health, polypharmacy, and individuals with signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit were significantly associated with potentially inappropriate medications use. Antiarrhythmics, antihistamines and antiadrenergic agents were the highest potentially inappropriate medications classes used for individuals with signs and symptoms of depression and cognitive deficit. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of use of potentially inappropriate medications is high among middle-aged people, a population that was previously under-researched, as well as among elderly people. Cognitive impairment alone or together with depression symptoms were associated factor for a potentially inappropriate medications use. Knowledge of the pharmacoepidemiology of potentially inappropriate medications is an important for the promotion of the rational use of drugs in public health.; OBJETIVOS: Estabelecer a frequência de uso de medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados e fatores associados, tais como sinais e sintomas de depressão e déficit cognitivo, em indivíduos de meia-idade e idosos. MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal de base populacional com 2.350 indivíduos, de idade entre 55 e 103 anos, cadastrados na atenção primária à saúde. Medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados foram definidos pelos Critérios Beers atualizados em 2019. As variáveis estudadas foram sociodemográficas, estilo de vida, clínicas, bem como sinais e sintomas de depressão e déficit cognitivo. Foi realizada análise de regressão multinomial. RESULTADOS: A frequência de uso de medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados foi de 65,4%. O uso de medicações potencialmente inapropriadas foi significativamente associado a indivíduos ex-fumantes e fumantes atuais, com autopercepção de saúde regular, usuários de polifarmácia e com sinais e sintomas de depressão e déficit cognitivo. Antiarrítmicos, anti-histamínicos e antiadrenérgicos foram as classes de medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados mais utilizada pelos indivíduos com sinais e sintomas de depressão e déficit cognitivo. CONCLUSÕES: A frequência de utilização de medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados é alta em pessoas de meia-idade, faixa etária pouco pesquisada, bem como em idosos. O comprometimento cognitivo, isoladamente ou em conjunto com sintomas de depressão, foi um fator associado ao uso de medicações potencialmente inapropriadas. O conhecimento da farmacoepidemiologia de utilização de medicamentos potencialmente inapropriados é importante para a promoção do uso racional de medicamentos na saúde pública.","Sgnaolin , Vanessa; Engroff, Paula; Linkievicz, Natascha Melo; Gomes, Irenio; Cataldo Neto, Alfredo","https://revistaseletronicas.pucrs.br/ojs/index.php/scientiamedica/article/view/34478",NA,"Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Sci. med.

"Erweiterung des Verständnisses der Enkelkinderbetreuung auf Gefühle der Einsamkeit und Isolation im späteren Leben : Eine Literaturübersicht; Extending understanding of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness and isolation in later life : A literature review","The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents serious challenges across the world. Among these challenges are the possible negative implications for the mental health and well-being of older persons that ongoing social distancing measures may cause. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, a growing body of literature explored the associations between grandchild caregiving, loneliness and social isolation. We summarize the existing literature on this topic. An association between the provision of grandchild care and reduced feelings of loneliness was found in cross-sectional studies; however, a longitudinal study identified possible gender differences in the impact of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness, with the commencement of grandchild care linked to grandfathers feeling lonelier. At the conclusion of the summary, we highlight the need for further research in this field. Further research is of particular relevance given the drastic changes to the way families and older people interact socially, brought about by the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Quirke, Eleanor; König, Hans-Helmut; Hajek, André","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00391-020-01776-5",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2020 Aug 27.; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2020 Aug 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Ambient Air Pollution Increases the Risk of Cerebrovascular and Neuropsychiatric Disorders through Induction of Inflammation and Oxidative Stress","Exposure to ambient air pollution is a well-established determinant of health and disease. The Lancet Commission on pollution and health concludes that air pollution is the leading environmental cause of global disease and premature death. Indeed, there is a growing body of evidence that links air pollution not only to adverse cardiorespiratory effects but also to increased risk of cerebrovascular and neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite being a relatively new area of investigation, overall, there is mounting recent evidence showing that exposure to multiple air pollutants, in particular to fine particles, may affect the central nervous system (CNS) and brain health, thereby contributing to increased risk of stroke, dementia, Parkinson's disease, cognitive dysfunction, neurodevelopmental disorders, depression and other related conditions. The underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain largely elusive. However, emerging evidence suggests inflammation and oxidative stress to be crucial factors in the pathogenesis of air pollution-induced disorders, driven by the enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species in response to exposure to various air pollutants. From a public health perspective, mitigation measures are urgent to reduce the burden of disease and premature mortality from ambient air pollution.","Hahad, Omar; Lelieveld, Jos; Birklein, Frank; Lieb, Klaus; Daiber, Andreas; Münzel, Thomas","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijms21124306",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;21(12)2020 Jun 17.; Publication details: Int J Mol Sci;21(12)2020 Jun 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health Burden of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Germany: Predictors of Mental Health Impairment","INTRODUCTION: COVID-19 is causing an enormous psychological burden for most people. This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15 037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden. CONCLUSIONS: Our data revealed that there have been changes in mental health and health status at an individual level since the outbreak of COVID-19. In order to maintain mental health, the observed predictors should be addressed.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Steinbach, Jasmin; Schweda, Adam; Beckord, Jil; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Musche, Venja; Dörrie, Nora; Teufel, Martin; Skoda, Eva-Maria","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150132720953682",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Prim Care Community Health;11: 2150132720953682, 2020.; Publication details: J Prim Care Community Health;11: 2150132720953682, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Medical research during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  The virus has quickly spread to a large number of countries leading to a great number of deaths  Unfortunately, till today there is no specific treatment or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2  Most of the suggested treatment medications are based on in vitro laboratory investigations, experimental animal models, or previous clinical experience in treating similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 or other retroviral infections  The running of any clinical trial during a pandemic is affected at multiple levels  Reasons for this include patient hesitancy or inability to continue investigative treatments due to self-isolation/quarantine, or limited access to public places (including hospitals)  Additional barriers relate to health care professionals being committed to other critical tasks or quarantining themselves due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients  The best research approaches are those that adapt to such external unplanned obstacles  Ongoing clinical trials before COVID-19 pandemic have the potential for identifying important therapies in the long-term if they can be completed as planned  However, these clinical trials may require modifications due a pandemic such as this one to ensure the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants as well as medical staff involved in the conduction of clinical trials  Clinical trials initiated during the pandemic must be time-efficient and flexible due to high contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the significant number of reported deaths, and time constraints needed to perform high quality clinical trials, enrolling adequate sample sizes  Collaboration between different countries as well as implementation of innovative clinical trial designs are essential to successfully complete such initiatives during the current pandemic  Studies looking at the long term sequalae of COVID-19 are also of importance as recent publications describe multi-organ involvement  Long term follow-up of COVID-19 survivors is thus also important to identify possible physical and mental health sequellae","AlNaamani, K.; AlSinani, S.; Barkun, A.

"What COVID-19 can mean for people with hemophilia beyond the infection risk","INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis. To combat its effects, many governments have opted for strategies of social isolation that involve a radical change in people's behavior. AREAS COVERED: For patients with hemophilia, the negative consequences of these measures can be greater, given they modify aspects of health care and lifestyles needed to counteract the adverse effects of hemophilia. The long-term consequences of the pandemic on patients with hemophilia are not well known. The aim of this special report is to show what COVID-19 could mean for this population, beyond the risk of infection. EXPERT OPINION: Considerations of the clinical, care, therapeutic, physical, nutritional, mental health, pain, and disability aspects that might be affected are included. Strategies are also suggested to minimize the effects that these issues can have on patients' lives. Patients, health professionals, and society as a whole must work together to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on people with hemophilia.","De la Corte-Rodriguez, Hortensia; Alvarez-Roman, M Teresa; Rodriguez-Merchan, Emerito Carlos; Jimenez-Yuste, Víctor","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17474086.2020.1818066",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Expert Rev Hematol;2020 Aug 30.; Publication details: Expert Rev Hematol;2020 Aug 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Best Practices for Approaching Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents major challenges for mental health care providers. In particular, providers who treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are now tasked with determining whether to initiate trauma-focused therapy during the pandemic and, if so, whether and how to adapt treatment. The purpose of this communication is to identify and organize key considerations for whether and how to deliver commonly used evidence-supported therapy protocols for trauma treatment-specifically, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy-during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for adults who currently meet the criteria for PTSD. Based on relevant public health and clinical literature, we present a structured guide that can be used by treatment teams and individual providers to evaluate whether initiating CPT or PE is indicated given a particular patient-provider pair and system context amidst pandemic conditions. In addition, we suggest appropriate action steps, including problem-solving strategies, evidence-informed modifications to CPT and PE, and alternative intervention approaches.","Hagerty, Sarah L; Wielgosz, Joseph; Kraemer, Jaclyn; Nguyen, Hong V; Loew, Dorene; Kaysen, Debra","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jts.22583",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Trauma Stress;2020 Aug 31.; Publication details: J Trauma Stress;2020 Aug 31.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological Distress and Coronavirus Fears During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant health and economic crisis around the world  The U S  saw a rapid escalation in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths in March, 2020  The financial consequences of a virtual economic shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus are widespread and debilitating, with over 30 million Americans (about 20% of the labor force) filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March  During these unprecedented times, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress and overall fear associated with the virus  DATA: To gain an understanding of the overall levels and predictors of psychological distress experienced in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U S , a survey was administered online to over 2,000 individuals residing in the country  The survey instrument was administered between March 22-26, 2020, during which time the country was suffering through a period of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases and fatalities  It was administered via MTurk, a popular crowdsourcing platform increasingly used by social scientists to procure large samples over a brief period of time  A short, valid screening instrument to measure psychological distress in individuals, the Kessler 10 scale was developed in the U S  in the 1990s as an easy-to-administer symptom assessment  The first dependent variable is the respondents' summated Kessler 10 score  The second dependent variable is a 7-category measure of how afraid the subject is about the novel coronavirus  The final dependent variable is also a 7-category scale, this time measuring self-reported likelihood of contracting the coronavirus  A variety of socio-demographic variables and health status were collected to analyze factors associated with psychological distress and mental health  METHODS: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression was employed to analyze these data  RESULTS: We find that protective factors against psychological distress include age, gender (male), and physical health  Factors exacerbating psychological distress include Hispanic ethnicity and a previous mental illness diagnosis  Similar factors are significantly related to fear of the virus and self-assessed likelihood of contracting it  DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with high levels of psychological distress in the U S  The Kessler 10 mean value in our sample is 21 12, which falls in the likely to experience mild mental illness category, yet is considerably higher compared to one of the largest and earliest benchmark studies validating the scale  Psychological distress is one element of overall mental health status that could be influenced by the COVID-10 pandemic  Other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders could also be affected by the pandemic  We encourage researchers to examine these and other mental health disorders in future research on the COVID-19 pandemic  CONCLUSION: The relatively high mean score (21 12) for psychological distress during early stages of the pandemic suggests government officials, policy-makers, and public health advocates should act quickly to address emerging mental health problems","French, Michael T.; Mortensen, Karoline; Timming, Andrew R.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Distress+and+Coronavirus+Fears+During+the+Initial+Phase+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+the+United+States",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The journal of mental health policy and economics;23(3):93-100, 2020.; Publication details: The journal of mental health policy and economics;23(3):93-100, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Higher executive control network coherence buffers against puberty-related increases in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence;further, early-maturing youth exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events  School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youth, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties  The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts  Methods: We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state fMRI five years before the pandemic (at T1), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (N=85;49 F)  Results On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the three months prior to pandemic to the two most recent weeks during the pandemic  We found that early-maturing youth exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low;in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1  Conclusions These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty","Chahal, Rajpreet; Kirshenbaum, Jaclyn S.; Miller, Jonas G.; Ho, Tiffany C.; Gotlib, Ian H.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.08.010",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging;2020.; Publication details: Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Don't Walk So Close to Me: Physical Distancing and Adult Physical Activity in Canada","Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures have been implemented globally  Canadians have been instructed to stay at home, which has likely resulted in significant changes in their physical activity  Using data from a national physical activity tracking app (PAC app), we aimed to determine device-measured physical activity levels immediately prior to and following the implementation of physical distancing measures in Canada to provide evidence for the development of physical activity recommendations for future pandemics or second wave infections  Methods: Demographic and physical activity data were extracted from the ParticipACTION app (PAC app), using a 10-week (10 February to 19 April 2020) quasi-experimental design to determine changes in physical activity 4 weeks pre-pandemic and 6 weeks post-pandemic declaration  Weekly physical activity levels were monitored through wearable fitness trackers and health apps linked to the PAC app, to record moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), and steps  Repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine changes over time (mean ± SE)  Findings: A total of 2,338 Canadians who were mostly 35-44 years old (26 6%) and female (90 2%) were included in the analysis  MVPA, LPA, and steps significantly declined immediately following the declaration of the pandemic (MVPA: pre-pandemic: 194 2 ± 5 2 min, post-pandemic: 176 7 ± 5 0 min, p &lt; 0 001;LPA: pre-pandemic: 1,000 5 ± 17 0 min, post-pandemic: 874 1 ± 15 6 min, p &lt; 0 001;steps: pre-pandemic: 48,625 ± 745 steps, post-pandemic: 43,395 ± 705 steps, p &lt; 0 001)  However, 6 weeks following pandemic declaration, MVPA (week 6: 204 4 ± 5 4 min, p = 0 498) had returned to pre-pandemic levels  LPA (week 6: 732 0 ± 14 3 min, p = &lt; 0 001) and steps (week 6: 41,946 ± 763, p &lt; 0 001) remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels at week 6  Interpretation: Although MVPA returned to pre-pandemic levels, significant and sustained declines in incidental LPA and steps were observed  Attenuating the loss of incidental physical activity should be a public health priority in response to future pandemics or a second wave of a COVID-19 infection, as it may have significant long-term implications for the physical and mental health of Canadians","Di Sebastiano, Katie M.; Chulak-Bozzer, Tala; Vanderloo, Leigh M.; Faulkner, Guy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01895",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology;11:1895-1895, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in psychology;11:1895-1895, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Weight-related lifestyle behaviours and the COVID-19 crisis: An online survey study of UK adults during social lockdown","Background: The COVID-19 crisis is likely to have had wide-ranging consequences on lifestyle behaviours and may have affected weight management. The objective of the present study was to examine perceptions of how weight-related lifestyle changed in social lockdown among UK adults compared with before the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis. Methods: As part of an online cross-sectional survey conducted during social lockdown in the United Kingdom, 723 UK adults reported on the extent to which their eating (healthiness of diet, frequency of bingeing on food), physical activity, sleep and alcohol consumption had changed since the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis and completed measures of current psychological well-being. Results: Although both improvements and declines in weight gain protective behaviours were reported, 79% of participants reported a decline in one or more weight gain protective behaviours. Both participants with a diagnosis of psychiatric illness or obesity (body mass index [BMI] = 30) were most likely to report declines in weight gain protective behaviours and show an overall profile of weight management behaviours worsening. Participants experiencing high levels of stress also reported reductions in more weight gain protective behaviours. Conclusions: Lifestyle behaviours associated with weight gain are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Reductions to the perceived frequency by which people engage in behaviours usually associated with successful weight management appear to be common, and people living with obesity and mental health problems may be at increased risk.","Robinson, Eric; Gillespie, Steven; Jones, Andrew","https://doi.org/10.1002/osp4.442",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Obes.

"Impact on mental health care and on mental health service users of the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods survey of UK mental health care staff","PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. METHODS: We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. RESULTS: 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. CONCLUSION: This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","Johnson, Sonia; Dalton-Locke, Christian; Vera San Juan, Norha; Foye, Una; Oram, Sian; Papamichail, Alexandra; Landau, Sabine; Rowan Olive, Rachel; Jeynes, Tamar; Shah, Prisha; Sheridan Rains, Luke; Lloyd-Evans, Brynmor; Carr, Sarah; Killaspy, Helen; Gillard, Steve; Simpson, Alan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01927-4",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol;2020 Aug 28.; Publication details: Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol;2020 Aug 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

We summarize the existing literature on this topic. An association between the provision of grandchild care and reduced feelings of loneliness was found in cross-sectional studies; however, a longitudinal study identified possible gender differences in the impact of grandchild care on feelings of loneliness, with the commencement of grandchild care linked to grandfathers feeling lonelier. At the conclusion of the summary, we highlight the need for further research in this field. Further research is of particular relevance given the drastic changes to the way families and older people interact socially, brought about by the COVID-19 global pandemic.","Quirke, Eleanor; König, Hans-Helmut; Hajek, André","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00391-020-01776-5",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2020 Aug 27.; Publication details: Z Gerontol Geriatr;2020 Aug 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients included in a bariatric surgery program","PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has radically impacted the world lifestyle. Epidemics are well-known to cause mental distress, and patients with a current or past history of obesity are at increased risk for the common presence of psychological comorbidities. This study investigates the psychological impact of the current pandemic in patients participating in a bariatric surgery program. METHODS: Patients were consecutively enrolled during the Italian lockdown among those waiting for bariatric surgery or attending a post-bariatric follow-up, and were asked to complete through an online platform the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and a self-assessment questionnaire of 22 items evaluating the resilience, change in eating behavior and emotional responses referring to the ongoing pandemic. RESULTS: 59% of the 434 enrolled subjects reported of being worried about the pandemic, and 63% specifically reported of being worried about their or their relatives' health. 37% and 56% felt lonelier and more bored, respectively. 66% was hungrier with increased frequency of snacking (55%) and 39% reported more impulse to eat. Noteworthy, 49% felt unable to follow a recommended diet. No difference in terms of psychological profile was recorded among pre and post-bariatric subjects. Logistic regression analysis on post-bariatric patients showed a relationship between snacking, hunger, eating impulsivity, and anxiety, stress, and/or depression symptoms. CONCLUSION: The pandemic led to increased psychological distress in patients with a current or past history of obesity, reducing quality of life and affecting dietary compliance. Targeted psychological support is warranted in times of increased stress for fragile subjects such as pre- and post-bariatric patients.

"Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels and Related Factors Among Operating Theater Workers During the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","PURPOSE: Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on health care workers because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among health care professionals working in operating theaters (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. DESIGN: The universe of this descriptive study consisted of health care professionals working in operating theaters in various health care institutions in Turkey. METHODS: Data were collected online between April 9, 2020 and April 12, 2020 using a SurveyMonkey Questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) and health care workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. FINDINGS: A total of 702 health care professionals working in operating theaters participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4 ± 4.6 (min 0 to max 21) and 10.0 ± 4.5 (min 0 to max 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (P < .05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease, and those whose workload increased (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among health care professionals working in operating theaters. To reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of health care professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.","Koksal, Ersin; Dost, Burhan; Terzi, Özlem; Ustun, Yasemin B; Özdin, Selçuk; Bilgin, Sezgin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Perianesth Nurs;2020 Jun 19.; Publication details: J Perianesth Nurs;2020 Jun 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Getting back to the ""new normal"": Autonomy restoration during a global pandemic","We investigate the psychological recovery process of full-time employees during the 2-week period at the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Past research suggests that recovery processes start after stressors abate and can take months or years to unfold. In contrast, we build on autonomy restoration theory to suggest that recovery of impaired autonomy starts immediately even as a stressor is ongoing. Using growth curve modeling, we examined the temporal trajectories of two manifestations of impaired autonomy-powerlessness and (lack of) authenticity-to test whether recovery began as the pandemic unfolded. We tested our predictions using a unique experience-sampling dataset collected over a 2-week period beginning on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a ""global pandemic"" by the World Health Organization and a ""national emergency"" by the U.S. Government (March 16-27, 2020). Results suggest that autonomy restoration was activated even as the pandemic worsened. Employees reported decreasing powerlessness and increasing authenticity during this period, despite their subjective stress-levels not improving. Further, the trajectories of recovery for both powerlessness and authenticity were steeper for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism, a personality characteristic central to stress reactions. Importantly, these patterns do not emerge in a second experience-sampling study collected prior to the COVID-19 crisis (September 9-20, 2019), highlighting how the pandemic initially threatened employee autonomy, but also how employees began to recover their sense of autonomy almost immediately. The present research provides novel insights into employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests that psychological recovery can begin during a stressful experience.

"COVID-19: PTSD symptoms in Greek health care professionals","Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the emergence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in Greek health care professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey from April 10 until April 13, 2020. The survey included sociodemographic questions and the following psychometric tools: the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-8 questionnaire, the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire Depression scale, the Athens Insomnia Scale, and 3 questions about negative perceptions of COVID-19. The survey was distributed through social media and comprises part of a larger survey targeting the general population. Altogether, 270 health care professionals responded to the survey. Results: Health care professionals appeared to be moderately stressed from the COVID-19 crisis, with women scoring higher on all clinical scales and the difference between women and men being statistically significant. Criteria for a probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis were met by a total of 16.7% (21.7% of women; 5.1% of men). Negative emotion and threatened or physical tension are positive significant predictors of PTSS. Those suffering with higher levels of PTSS scored positively for insomnia and exhibited significantly higher peritraumatic distress. Conclusion: Health care professionals could benefit by being screened for PTSS and insomnia.

"Developing thinking around mental health science: the example of intrusive, emotional mental imagery after psychological trauma","INTRODUCTION: One route to advancing psychological treatments is to harness mental health science, a multidisciplinary approach including individuals with lived experience and end users (e.g., Holmes, E. A., Craske, M. G., & Graybiel, A. M. (2014). Psychological treatments: A call for mental-health science. Nature, 511(7509), 287-289. doi:10.1038/511287a). While early days, we here illustrate a line of research explored by our group-intrusive imagery-based memories after trauma. METHOD/RESULTS: We illustrate three possible approaches through which mental health science may stimulate thinking around psychological treatment innovation. First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be modified in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic). CONCLUSIONS: These three approaches suggest options for potential innovative avenues through which mental health science may be harnessed to recouple basic and applied research and transform treatment development.","Singh, Laura; Espinosa, Lisa; Ji, Julie L; Moulds, Michelle L; Holmes, Emily A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2020.1804845",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cogn Neuropsychiatry;: 1-16, 2020 Aug 26.; Publication details: Cogn Neuropsychiatry;: 1-16, 2020 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Epidemiological and clinical features of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha city, Hunan, China","In December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The present study was conducted to report the clinical characteristics of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, a city outside of Wuhan. All of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha City, the designated hospital for COVID-19 assigned by the Changsha City Government. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, data of laboratory, radiological picture, treatment, and outcomes records of 201 COVID-19 patients were collected using electronic medical records. This study population consisted of 201 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha by April 28, 2020. The median age of the patients was 45 years (IQR 34-59). About half (50.7%) of the patients were male, and most of the infected patients were staff (96 [47.8%]). Concerning the epidemiologic history, the number of patients linked to Wuhan was 92 (45.8%). The most common symptoms were fever (125 [62.2%]), dry cough (118 [58.7%]), fatigue (65 [32.3%]), and pharyngalgia (31 [15.4%]). One hundred and forty-four (71.6%) enrolled patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Fifty-four (26.9%) patients showed unilateral involvement, and three (1.5%) patients showed no abnormal signs or symptoms. The laboratory findings differed significantly between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had depressed white blood cell (WBC), neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, higher plasma levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (CREA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected in the ICU group. In this single-center study of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, 22.4% of patients were admitted to ICU. Based on our findings, we propose that the risk of cellular immune deficiency, hepatic injury, and kidney injury should be monitored. Previous reports focused on the clinical features of patients from Wuhan, China. With the global epidemic of COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan.","Zhou, Jian; Sun, Jingjing; Cao, Ziqin; Wang, Wanchun; Huang, Kang; Zheng, Fang; Xie, Yuanlin; Jiang, Dixuan; Zhou, Zhiguo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000021824",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Medicine (Baltimore);99(34): e21824, 2020 Aug 21.; Publication details: Medicine (Baltimore);99(34): e21824, 2020 Aug 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Factors affecting the anxiety levels of adolescents in home-quarantine during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","BACKGROUND: The long-term closing of schools and home-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic cause negative effects on the physical and mental health of young people. Studies evaluating the mental health of adolescents during the pandemic are limited in the literature. AIM: In our study, it was aimed to determine the results of home-quarantine measures taken for adolescents during the pandemic and the affecting factors. METHOD: This study was conducted as an online cross-sectional self-report questionnaire and included children aged between 12 and 18 years. The data were obtained from the children of volunteer families via Facebook family groups, and Google Forms questionnaires sent by the child psychiatry clinic to their smartphones. Sociodemographic form, State-Trait anxiety scale, and UCLA loneliness survey were used as data collection tools. RESULTS: We examined the data of 745 adolescents. The average age of the study group was 16.83 ± 1.66 years, and 69.5% were females. It was determined that 88.2% of the adolescents followed the developments in the COVID-19 process and obtained most information from the television. State anxiety was related to ""Former psychiatric referral"" by 4.39-fold, ""Having a COVID positive patient in the family or your surroundings"" by 3.81-fold, and ""The most common medium for obtaining COVID-related information"" by 2.41-fold.

"Demographic and health factors associated with pandemic anxiety in the context of COVID-19","OBJECTIVES: The mental health consequences of COVID-19 are predicted to have a disproportionate impact on certain groups. We aimed to develop a brief measure, the Pandemic Anxiety Scale, to capture the specific aspects of the pandemic that are provoking anxiety, and explore how these vary by health and demographic factors. DESIGN: Data were from a convenience sample of parents (N = 4,793) and adolescents (N = 698) recruited in the first 6 weeks of lockdown. METHODS: Factor analytic and IRT methods were used to validate the new measure in both parent and adolescent samples. Associations between scores on the new measure and age, gender, household income, and physical health status were explored using structural equation modelling (SEM). RESULTS: Two factors were identified in both samples: disease anxiety (e.g., catching, transmitting the virus) and consequence anxiety (e.g., impact on economic prospects); and unique associations with health and demographic factors were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Anxieties due to the COVID-19 are multifaceted, and the PAS is a short, reliable, and valid measure of these concerns. These anxieties are differentially associated with demographic, social, and health factors, which should be considered when developing strategies to mitigate the mental health impact of the pandemic.","McElroy, Eoin; Patalay, Praveetha; Moltrecht, Bettina; Shevlin, Mark; Shum, Adrienne; Creswell, Cathy; Waite, Polly","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12470",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Br J Health Psychol;2020 Aug 29.; Publication details: Br J Health Psychol;2020 Aug 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A rapid review of pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes","COVID-19 spread rapidly causing widescale loss of life and economic devastation. Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesise and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010-April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32,049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorised them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesised effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790",NA,"Country: AU; AUSTRÁLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain. BACKGROUND: Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop compassion fatigue or burnout, which puts them at risk for mental health problems. DESIGN: Cross-sectional online survey. METHODS: A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire (ProQoL), and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies. RESULTS: Physicians had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while nurses had higher compassion satisfaction scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while levels of compassion satisfaction and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of compassion fatigue and burnout have remained moderate/high. However, compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve compassion satisfaction and prevent burnout and compassion fatigue among professionals in the long term.","Ruiz-Fernández, María Dolores; Ramos-Pichardo, Juan Diego; Ibáñez-Masero, Olivia; Cabrera-Troya, José; Carmona-Rega, María Inés; Ortega-Galán, Ángela María","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15469",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Nurs;2020 Aug 28.; Publication details: J Clin Nurs;2020 Aug 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Exposure to health misinformation about COVID-19 and increased tobacco and alcohol use: a population-based survey in Hong Kong","INTRODUCTION: Health information about COVID-19 has been circulating in social networking sites, including unproven claims that smoking and alcohol drinking could protect against COVID-19. We examined if exposure to such claims was associated with changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, landline and mobile phone survey of 1501 randomly sampled adults aged 18 years or older (47.5% male) in Hong Kong in April 2020. Respondents reported if they had ever seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from popular social networking platforms. Current tobacco and alcohol users reported if they had increased or reduced their consumption since the outbreak. Prevalence data were weighted by sex, age and education of the general adult population. RESULTS: 19.0% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.4%) of all respondents reported having seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from social networking sites. Multinomial logistic regression showed that exposure to the claims was significantly associated with increased tobacco use (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.20) in current tobacco users (N=280) and increased alcohol use (OR 4.16, 95% CI 2.00 to 8.67) in current drinkers (N=722), adjusting for sex, age, education level, alcohol/tobacco use status, home isolation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and survey method. CONCLUSION: Our results first showed that exposure to health misinformation that smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19 was associated with self-reported increases in tobacco and alcohol consumption in Chinese during the pandemic.","Luk, Tzu Tsun; Zhao, Shengzhi; Weng, Xue; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Wu, Yongda Socrates; Ho, Sai Yin; Lam, Tai Hing; Wang, Man Ping","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2020-055960",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Tob Control;2020 Aug 27.; Publication details: Tob Control;2020 Aug 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Productivity Commission's Draft Report illustrates the benefits and risks of economic perspectives on mental healthcare","In 2018, the Australian Government instructed the Productivity Commission to examine the social and economic effects of poor mental health, as well as make recommendations on how they might be addressed. The resulting Draft Report demonstrates both the benefits and risks of an economic approach to these issues. Some of the broader systemic recommendations have merit such as the need for stepped care, coordinated crisis management and the important role of welfare, housing and the workplace in improving mental health. However, there are areas of concern, particularly for mental health services in the public sector. One is a disproportionate emphasis on prevention and intervention in the early years of life for strategies where evidence for effectiveness is limited. Another is the introduction of market-based approaches such as shadow billing or a commissioner/provider split to the funding of mental health services across Australia. Among the numerous problems of such market-driven approaches are the increased costs of additional bureaucracy and the lack of commissioner expertise in planning services or evidence-based practice. As a result, similar arrangements have been abandoned in other jurisdictions. The Commission's final recommendations and the Australian Government's response are awaited and the resulting changes to the mental health system, and beyond, may well be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, reform should be based on evidence and achieved without increasing administrative complexity.","Kisely, Steve; Looi, Jeffrey Cl","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0004867420951255",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Aust N Z J Psychiatry;: 4867420951255, 2020 Aug 27.; Publication details: Aust N Z J Psychiatry;: 4867420951255, 2020 Aug 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Nurses' ethical challenges caring for people with COVID-19: A qualitative study","BACKGROUND: Ethical challenges are common in clinical nursing practice, and an infectious environment could put nurses under ethical challenges more easily, which may cause nurses to submit to negative emotions and psychological pressure, damaging their mental health. PURPOSE: To examine the ethical challenges encountered by nurses caring for patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and to provide nurses with suggestions and support regarding promotion of their mental health. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD: A qualitative study was carried out using a qualitative content analysis. The participants were 18 nurses who agreed to attend an interview and describe their own experiences of providing care to COVID-19 patients in China. They were purposively sampled, and structured, in-depth interviews were performed. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed from February to March 2020. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Shandong University, China. FINDINGS: The findings revealed three main themes and 10 categories. The themes were the following: (1) ethical challenges (people with COVID-19, inequality, professional ethics, and job competency); (2) coping styles (active control and planning, seeking support as well as catharsis, and staying focused); and (3) impacts on career (specialized nursing skills, scientific research ability, and management skills). CONCLUSION: Nurses faced ethical challenges on multiple fronts in caring for COVID-19 patients. The results may help nurses with more safety, ethics, and humanistic care in nursing practice.","Jia, Yuxiu; Chen, Ou; Xiao, Zhiying; Xiao, Juan; Bian, Junping; Jia, Hongying","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0969733020944453",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Nurs Ethics;: 969733020944453, 2020 Aug 28.; Publication details: Nurs Ethics;: 969733020944453, 2020 Aug 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Coping style, social support and psychological distress in the general Chinese population in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological status of the general population in mainland China during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to explore the factors influencing psychological distress, in order to provide the basis for further psychological intervention programs. METHODS: We administered three questionnaires on-line to a convenience sample of the general population from different regions of mainland China from February 1 to February 4, 2020. We used the Mandarin versions of the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). We also collected demographic data and other information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing psychological distress. RESULTS: Of 1607 respondents, 1588 returned valid questionnaires and were included in the analysis. Nearly one quarter (22.8%) had high levels of psychological distress (K6 score &#8805; 13). Individuals with higher psychological distress were more likely to be unmarried, spend more than 6 h per day searching for information about COVID-19, more frequently adopt a passive coping style, and report less social support than those with lower psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 outbreak in China has a great impact on the mental health status of the general population. Active coping strategies and increased social support are significantly correlated with decreased psychological distress, and may serve as the basis for psychological interventions.","Yu, Hua; Li, Mingli; Li, Zhixiong; Xiang, Weiyi; Yuan, Yiwen; Liu, Yaya; Li, Zhe; Xiong, Zhenzhen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02826-3",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 426, 2020 Aug 27.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 426, 2020 Aug 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological distress and sleep problems when people are under interpersonal isolation during an epidemic: A nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND.: During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people are under the dual pressure of interpersonal isolation and concerns about infection. An evaluation of people's psychological status and risk factors is needed to conduct target interventions. METHODS.: This was a nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study using quota and snowball sampling methods during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Participants' characteristics and experiences were obtained by an online questionnaire and telephone review. Psychological distress and sleep problems were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Insomnia Severity Index. RESULTS.: A total of 23,500 participants were recruited, and 19,372 valid questionnaires were received from 11 centers. Overall, 11.0-13.3% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms, and 1.9-2.7% had severe symptoms. The prevalence of psychological and sleep problems has increased. Working as frontline medical staff (Odds Ratio OR = 3.406), living in Hubei Province (OR = 2.237), close contacts with COVID-19 (OR = 1.808), and age 35-49 years (OR = 1.310) were risk factors for anxiety symptoms; no outside activity for 2 weeks (OR = 2.167) and age 35-49 years (OR = 1.198) were risk factors for depression symptoms; and living in Hubei Province (OR = 2.376), no outside activity for 2 weeks (OR = 1.927), and age 35-49 years (OR = 1.262) were risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Only 1.9% of participants received counseling during the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS.: Psychological and sleep problems increased during interpersonal isolation due to COVID-19.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan, China","Fangcang shelter hospitals were established in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a countermeasure to stop the spread of the disease. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on mental health problems among patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and major influencing factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals. From February 23, 2020, to February 26, 2020, we obtained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information of COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital (Wuhan, China) and assessed their mental health status and sleep quality. Data were obtained with an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a set of items on demographic characteristics, a set of items on clinical characteristics, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Three hundred seven COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 18.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Poor sleep quality and having &#8805; two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms. Female sex, having a family member with confirmed COVID-19, and having &#8805; two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to be common among COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital, with some patients being at high risk.","Dai, Ling-Ling; Wang, Xi; Jiang, Tian-Ci; Li, Peng-Fei; Wang, Yu; Wu, Shu-Jun; Jia, Liu-Qun; Liu, Meng; An, Lin; Cheng, Zhe","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238416",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;15(8): e0238416, 2020.; Publication details: PLoS One;15(8): e0238416, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Dialectical behavior therapy-based psychological intervention for woman in late pregnancy and early postpartum suffering from COVID-19: a case report","At the end of 2019, a new form of pneumonia disease known as the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread throughout most provinces of China, and the total global number of COVID-19 cases has surpassed 500 000 by Mar. 27, 2020 (WHO, 2020). On Jan. 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global health emergency (WHO, 2020). COVID-19 causes most damage to the respiratory system, leading to pneumonia or breathing difficulties. The confirmed case fatality risk (cCFR) was estimated to be 5% to 8% (Jung et al., 2020). Besides physical pain, COVID-19 also induces psychological distress, with depression, anxiety, and stress affecting the general population, quarantined population, medical staff, and patients at different levels (Kang et al., 2020; Xiang et al., 2020). Previous research on patients in isolation wards highlighted the risk of depressed mood, fear, loneliness, frustration, excessive worries, and insomnia (Abad et al., 2010).","Huang, Jin-Wen; Zhou, Xiao-Yi; Lu, Shao-Jia; Xu, Yi; Hu, Jian-Bo; Huang, Man-Li; Wang, Hua-Fen; Hu, Chan-Chan; Li, Shu-Guang; Chen, Jing-Kai; Wang, Zhong; Hu, Shao-Hua; Wei, Ning","https://dx.doi.org/10.1631/jzus.B2010012",NA,"Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Zhejiang Univ Sci B;21(5): 394-399, 2020 May.; Publication details: J Zhejiang Univ Sci B;21(5): 394-399, 2020 May.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Coronavirus Infections/therapy; Dialectical Behavior Therapy; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Pneumonia, Viral/therapy; Adult; Anxiety/therapy; Betacoronavirus; China; Depression/therapy; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women/psychology; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Discriminating Metabolic Health Status in a Cohort of Nursing Students: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study","BACKGROUND: Obesity is currently a worldwide health crisis. Nurses are integral members of the primary health care team and have an important role in managing obesity and administering physical activity (PA) for patients. However, research shows that nurses tend to be overweight or obese, have poor metabolic health, and do not meet PA recommendations. This is problematic because PA is linked to both physiological and psychological well-being and may also influence how nurses counsel their patients. Nursing students are the next generation of nurses; however, there is limited research examining PA (among other lifestyle factors) and metabolic health in nursing students. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this research is to examine multiple lifestyle factors (including PA, nutrition, sleep, and stress) and determine whether these factors are associated with metabolic health in full-time undergraduate nursing students. METHODS: An estimated 320 nursing students (18 years of age and older) will be assessed for their metabolic health. Metabolic status will be determined by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage [skinfold measures (FitSystems Inc)], resting blood pressure [automated oscillatory (Omron Healthcare Inc)], and fasting blood glucose (glucometer). Lifestyle factors will also be measured, including PA and sleep [the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day accelerometry (wGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC)], nutrition [3-day diet log (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems)], and stress [the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, heart rate variability assessments, and salivary cortisol (ELISA, Eagle Biosciences)]. The association between metabolic status and PA, sleep quantity and quality, nutrition, and stress will be examined by linear regression analyses. Differences by year of study in metabolic health status, PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress will be examined by 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To determine the ability of PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress to discriminate prevalent overweight and obesity or poor metabolic status, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed. Statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC). RESULTS: Based on pilot data, we believe senior nursing students will have worse metabolic health (ie, higher BMI and WHR, increased body fat percentage, higher blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose) compared to first-year students. We hypothesize that poor PA participation, poor sleep quantity and quality, increased food intake, poor nutrition, and increased stress will be associated with worse metabolic health in full-time nursing students. The study received funding in February 2020. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, work on this study has been delayed. We are currently completing our application for institutional research ethics approval. Data collection is projected to begin in January 2021, with data collection and analyses expected to be completed by May 2022. CONCLUSIONS: This study will be the first published research to examine the relationship between lifestyle choices and metabolic status in nursing students attending a Canadian institution. More importantly, the results of this study will support the development of an informed intervention that will target the identified lifestyle factors, improving the physiological and mental health and well-being of nursing students.

"Perinatal distress during COVID-19: a thematic analysis of an online parenting forum","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual, population and system level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children and other family members. In addition, they are a vulnerable group, at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high risk external environment. OBJECTIVE: Examination of the public discourse of a perinatal cohort to understand unmet health information and support needs and impacts on mothering identity and social dynamics, in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to post-birth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from Jan 27 to May 12 2020 inclusive. Key search terms included: 'COVID', 'corona' and 'pandemic'. A three-phase analysis was conducted including: thematic analysis, sentiment analysis and word frequency calculations. RESULTS: The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. These were: 1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; 2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; 3) altered family and support relationships; 4) guilt tampered happiness; and, 5) family future postponed. Sentiment analysis revealed content was predominantly negative (very negative: 537 and moderately negative: 443 compared to very positive: 236 and moderately positive: 340). Negative words were frequently used with associated derivatives including 'worried' (19.9%); 'risk' (17.2%); 'anxiety' (11.8%); 'concerns' (8.8%) and 'stress' (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely and reassuring. Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort.","Chivers, Bonnie R; Garad, Rhonda M; Boyle, Jacqueline A; Skouteris, Helen; Teede, Helena J; Harrison, Cheryce L","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22002",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide: Biosynthesis, Consumption, and Therapeutic Role in Cardiac Diseases","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an abundant cofactor that plays crucial roles in several cellular processes. NAD can be synthesized de novo starting with tryptophan, or from salvage pathways starting with NAD precursors like nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), or nicotinamide riboside (NR), referred to as niacin/B3 vitamins, arising from dietary supply or from cellular NAD catabolism. Given the interconversion between its oxidized (NAD+ ) and reduced form (NADH), NAD participates in a wide range of reactions: regulation of cellular redox status, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Plus, NAD acts as a signaling molecule, being a co-substrate for several enzymes such as sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs), and some ectoenzymes like CD38, regulating critical biological processes like gene expression, DNA repair, calcium signaling, and circadian rhythms. Given the large number of mitochondria present in cardiac tissue, the heart has the highest NAD levels and is one of the most metabolically demanding organs. In several models of heart failure, myocardial NAD levels are depressed and this depression is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic remodeling, and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that regulating NAD homeostasis by NAD precursor supplementation has therapeutic efficiency in improving myocardial bioenergetics and function. This review provides an overview of the latest understanding of the different NAD biosynthesis pathways, as well as its role as a signaling molecule particularly in cardiac tissue.

"Mental health among head and neck surgeons in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national study","PURPOSE: Head and neck surgeons are among the highest risk for COVID-19 exposure, which also brings great risk to their mental wellbeing. In this study, we aim to evaluate mental health symptoms among head and neck surgeons in Brazil surrounding the time it was declared the epicenter of the virus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional, survey-based study evaluating burnout, anxiety, distress, and depression among head and neck surgeons in Brazil, assessed through the single-item Mini-Z burnout assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. RESULTS: 163 physicians completed the survey (74.2% males). Anxiety, distress, burnout, and depression symptoms were reported in 74 (45.5%), 43 (26.3%), 24 (14.7%), and 26 (16.0%) physicians, respectively. On multivariable analysis, female physicians were more likely to report a positive screening for burnout compared to males (OR 2.88, CI [1.07-7.74]). Physicians 45 years or older were less likely to experience anxiety symptoms than those younger than 45 years (OR 0.40, CI [0.20-0.81]). Physicians with no self-reported prior psychiatric conditions were less likely to have symptoms of distress compared to those with such history (OR 0.11, CI [0.33-0.38]). CONCLUSION: Head and neck surgeons in Brazil reported symptoms of burnout, anxiety, distress and depression during our study period within the COVID-19 pandemic. Institutions should monitor these symptoms throughout the pandemic. Further study is required to assess the long-term implications for physician wellness.","Civantos, Alyssa M; Bertelli, Antonio; Gonçalves, Antonio; Getzen, Emily; Chang, Changgee; Long, Qi; Rajasekaran, Karthik","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjoto.2020.102694",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Otolaryngol;41(6): 102694, 2020 Aug 21.; Publication details: Am J Otolaryngol;41(6): 102694, 2020 Aug 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Effectiveness and influencing factors of online education for caregivers of patients with eating disorders during COVID-19 pandemic in China","OBJECTIVE: The goals were twofold: To estimate the depression and anxiety levels among caregivers of patients with eating disorders (ED) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with a control group, and to assess whether an online education program was effective in decreasing the anxiety and depression of the caregivers of patients with ED, and associated factors. METHOD: Caregivers of patients with ED (n = 254) and a comparison group of non-ED caregivers (N = 254) were recruited at baseline. Additionally, caregivers of patients with ED were invited into a free 4-week online education program, with an additional online group as support. Depression and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. RESULTS: Caregivers of patients with ED showed significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than the comparison group of non-ED caregivers. The online education program showed no significant effect on decreasing depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of patients with ED overall. Caregivers who had older loved ones and not living with them were more likely to decrease their depression levels. Caregivers of patients with longer illness duration were less likely to decrease their anxiety levels. DISCUSSION: These results showed that caregivers of ED patients suffered more serious psychological distress during the pandemic. A more structured and intensive online intervention with a limited number of participants might be required to address caregivers' distress in post-COVID-19 China.","Guo, Lei; Wu, Mengting; Zhu, Zhuoying; Zhang, Lei; Peng, Sufang; Li, Wei; Chen, Han; Fernández-Aranda, Fernando; Chen, Jue","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/erv.2783",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Eat Disord Rev;2020 Aug 27.; Publication details: Eur Eat Disord Rev;2020 Aug 27.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Hemoglobin A1C is a Predictor of COVID-19 Severity in Patients with Diabetes","INTRODUCTION: Poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been linked to diabetes but its relation to pre-infection glycemic control is still unclear. METHODS: To address this question we report here the association between pre-infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services, Israel, between February 1 and April 30, 2020. Using the LHS integrated electronic medical records system we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socioeconomic status, weight, height, body mass index, A1C, prior diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure , smoking and chronic lung disease. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85 %) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socioeconomic background and had a higher baseline A1C. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was A1C&#8805;9%. CONCLUSION: Using pre-infection glycemic control data we identify A1C as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.

"Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic: Research Strategies Based on the Evolutionary and Molecular Characteristics of Coronaviruses","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing global health emergency, is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Emerging in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it spread widely across the world causing panic-worst ever economic depression is visibly predictable. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as a major public health concern having caused three zoonotic outbreaks; severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and currently this devastating COVID-19. Research strategies focused on understanding the evolutionary origin, transmission, and molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathogenesis need to be urgently formulated to manage the current and possible future coronaviral outbreaks. Current response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring/containment. Although frantic global efforts for developing safe and effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents are on, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists till date. In this review, research strategies for coping with COVID-19 based on evolutionary and molecular aspects of coronaviruses have been proposed.","Majid, Sabhiya; Farooq, Rabia; Khan, Mosin S; Rashid, Samia; Bhat, Showkat A; Wani, Hilal A; Qureshi, Waseem","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00457-z",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: SN Compr Clin Med;: 1-10, 2020 Aug 25.; Publication details: SN Compr Clin Med;: 1-10, 2020 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

It also aimed at identifying the determinants of depression and anxiety. A total of 476 university students living in Bangladesh participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey. A standardized e-questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media-Facebook. The information was analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI = 0.961-8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736-1.952). It is expected that both the government and universities could work together to fix the academic delays and financial problems to reduce depression and anxiety among university students.","Islam, Md Akhtarul; Barna, Sutapa Dey; Raihan, Hasin; Khan, Md Nafiul Alam; Hossain, Md Tanvir","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238162",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;15(8): e0238162, 2020.; Publication details: PLoS One;15(8): e0238162, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Impacts Mental Health Outcomes and Ability/Desire to Participate in Research Among Current Research Participants","OBJECTIVE: Examine COVID-19 impact on current research participants' mental health outcomes, ability to adhere to behavioral intervention recommendations, and desire to participate in research. METHODS: Quantitative/qualitative cross-sectional survey among adults currently enrolled in health-related research (n=250; 85% women; >50% currently enrolled in behavioral weight loss intervention). RESULTS: COVID-19 is perceived as a severe threat by most (62.3%). Related to COVID-19, 29.6% of participants reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety/depression and 68.4% reported moderate/severe PTSD symptomatology, with women more likely to demonstrate moderate/severe anxiety/depression (p=0.047) and PTSD symptomatology (p=0.028) relative to men. Those with moderate/severe levels of anxiety/depression (p=0.0154) and distress (p=0.0330) were more likely to report decreased desire to participate in research. Among those in behavioral interventions, individuals perceiving COVID-19 as a moderate/severe threat or experiencing moderate/severe depression or PTSD symptomatology were 4-19 times more likely to report COVID-19 affected their ability to adhere to behavioral recommendations. Qualitative analysis identified four themes describing COVID-19 impact on research experiences: transition; remote intervention delivery; ability to adhere to program goals; research participation interest.

"Physical activity and nutrition guidelines to help with the fight against COVID-19","As the world is witnessing the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019, emerging genetics and clinical pieces of evidence suggest a similar immunopathology to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus and consequently being largely inactive is associated with unintended consequences. These can actually enhance the infection risk and exacerbate poor health conditions including impaired immune function. Physical activity is a feasible way of improving health, particularly physical and mental health in a time of social isolation. However, people with certain health conditions in these circumstances may need a special physical activity programme in addition to any exercise they may already be performing via online programmes. This review aims to provide practical guidelines during the COVID-19 quarantine period. We suggest performing aerobic, resistance training, respiratory muscle training and yoga in the healthy, and in those with upper respiratory tract illness, patients with lower respiratory tract illness should be restricted to respiratory muscle training and yoga. In addition, vitamins D and C, omega-3 fatty acids, and regular consumption of fruit and vegetables might be considered as nutritional aids to support the immune system in those affected by COVID-19.","Khoramipour, Kayvan; Basereh, Aref; Hekmatikar, Amirhoseein Ahmadi; Castell, Lindy; Ruhee, Ruheea Taskin; Suzuki, Katsuhiko","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1807089",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Sports Sci;: 1-7, 2020 Aug 25.; Publication details: J Sports Sci;: 1-7, 2020 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Effect of Environmental Stressors on Tinnitus: A Prospective Longitudinal Study on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding sound, and the distress caused by it, is rarely a static phenomenon. It rather fluctuates over time depending on endogenous and exogenous factors. The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential environmental stressor that might influence the individually perceived tinnitus distress. Since not all people are affected by the pandemic in the same way, the situation allows one to identify environmental factors and personality traits that impact tinnitus distress differently. In our study, 122 tinnitus patients were included at two time points: in the year 2018 and during the German lockdown in April 2020. We assessed tinnitus-related distress, depressive symptoms, personality characteristics and the individual perception of the pandemic situation. On average, there was only a small increase of tinnitus distress with heterogeneous changes during the lockdown. People perceiving the situation as generally stressful with increased grief, frustration, stress and nervousness reported the worsening of tinnitus distress. People with high values in neuroticism also reported the worsening of tinnitus distress, while the personality traits extraversion, conscientiousness and openness seemed to be a protection factor. The study identifies factors that influence tinnitus distress change during a pandemic and spots those patients that need specific help in the pandemic situation.","Schlee, Winfried; Hølleland, Sondre; Bulla, Jan; Simoes, Jorge; Neff, Patrick; Schoisswohl, Stefan; Woelflick, Stella; Schecklmann, Martin; Schiller, Axel; Staudinger, Susanne; Probst, Thomas; Langguth, Berthold","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092756",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Med;9(9)2020 Aug 26.; Publication details: J Clin Med;9(9)2020 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Emotional and Cognitive Responses and Behavioral Coping of Chinese Medical Workers and General Population during the Pandemic of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) might affect the psychological health of population, especially medical workers. We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional and cognitive responses and behavioral coping among Chinese residents. METHODS: An online investigation was run from 5 February to 25 February 2020, which recruited a total of 616 Chinese residents. Self-designed questionnaires were used to collect demographic information, epidemic knowledge and prevention of COVID-19 and characteristics of medical workers. The emotional and cognitive responses were assessed via the Symptom Check List-30 (SCL-30) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Behavioral coping was assessed via Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: In total, 131 (21.3%) medical workers and 485 (78.7%) members of the general public completed the structured online survey. The structural equation models showed that emotional response interacted with cognitive response, and both emotional response and cognitive response affected the behavioral coping. Multivariate regression showed that positive coping enhanced emotional and cognitive responses, while negative coping reduced emotional and cognitive responses. The emotional response (depression, anxiety and photic anxiety) scores of the participants were higher than the norm (all p < 0.001); in particular, the panic scores of members of the general public were higher than those of medical workers (p < 0.05), as well as the cognitive response (paranoia and compulsion). Both positive and negative coping scores of the participants were lower than the norm (p < 0.001), and the general public had higher negative coping than medical workers (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: During the preliminary stage of COVID-19, our study confirmed the significance of emotional and cognitive responses, which were associated with behavioral coping and significantly influenced the medical workers and the general public's cognition and level of public health emergency preparedness. These results emphasize the importance of psychological health at times of widespread crisis.","Cai, Zemin; Zheng, Shukai; Huang, Yanhong; Zhang, Xuanzhi; Qiu, Zhaolong; Huang, Anyan; Wu, Kusheng","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176198",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 Aug 26.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Professional Quality of Life and Mental Health Outcomes among Health Care Workers Exposed to Sars-Cov-2 (Covid-19)","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide, and Italy represented the first European country involved. Healthcare workers (HCWs) facing COVID-19 pandemic represented an at-risk population for new psychosocial COVID-19 strain and consequent mental health symptoms. The aim of the present study was to identify the possible impact of working contextual and personal variables (age, gender, working position, years of experience, proximity to infected patients) on professional quality of life, represented by compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout, and secondary traumatization (ST), in HCWs facing COVID-19 emergency. Further, two multivariable linear regression analyses were fitted to explore the association of mental health selected outcomes, anxiety and depression, with some personal and working characteristics that are COVID-19-related. A sample of 265 HCWs of a major university hospital in central Italy was consecutively recruited at the outpatient service of the Occupational Health Department during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were assessed by Professional Quality of Life-5 (ProQOL-5), the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Seven-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) to evaluate, respectively, CS, burnout, ST, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Females showed higher ST than males, while frontline staff and healthcare assistants reported higher CS rather than second-line staff and physicians, respectively. Burnout and ST, besides some work or personal variables, were associated to depressive or anxiety scores. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new working challenge for HCWs and intervention strategies to prevent burnout and ST to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.","Buselli, Rodolfo; Corsi, Martina; Baldanzi, Sigrid; Chiumiento, Martina; Del Lupo, Elena; Dell'Oste, Valerio; Bertelloni, Carlo Antonio; Massimetti, Gabriele; Dell'Osso, Liliana; Cristaudo, Alfonso; Carmassi, Claudia","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176180",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 Aug 26.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

RESULTS: The majority of neuropsychology trainees reported some impact of the pandemic on their professional and/or personal life. Overall, the impact did not differ by training level, geographic location, or demographic factors. Trainees' primary professional concerns included uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic on their professional future, loss of clinical hours, and desire for increased and ongoing communication from their leadership. A notable percentage of trainees reported increased personal mental health symptoms (i.e. anxiety/depression; 74%/54%), as well as a number of other personal stressors. Despite the transition to telehealth (mostly interviews/feedback sessions), few trainees have prior training or experience in providing neuropsychological services via phone or video platform. A limited proportion of trainees (approximately 10%) were still seeing patients face-to-face for neuropsychological evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic as of 14 April 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting neuropsychological training and the well-being of trainees. This survey highlights the importance of communication with trainees during uncertain times. Based on the survey results, recommendations were developed to assist neuropsychology organizations in developing initiatives to support trainees during the current pandemic and in the future.","Guidotti Breting, Leslie M; Towns, Stephanie J; Butts, Alissa M; Brett, Benjamin L; Leaffer, Emily B; Whiteside, Douglas M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1809712",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Clin Neuropsychol;: 1-30, 2020 Aug 26.; Publication details: Clin Neuropsychol;: 1-30, 2020 Aug 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy in fulminant COVID-19 associated with cytokine release syndrome and resolution following therapeutic plasma exchange: a case-report","BACKGROUND: Fulminant (life-threatening) COVID-19 can be associated with acute respiratory failure (ARF), multi-system organ failure and cytokine release syndrome (CRS). We present a rare case of fulminant COVID-19 associated with reverse-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy (RTCC) that improved with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old previous healthy male presented in the emergency room with 4 days of dry cough, chest pain, myalgias and fatigue. He progressed to ARF requiring high-flow-nasal-cannula (flow: 60 L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%). Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed COVID-19 and chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. Biochemistry suggested CRS: increased C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and interleukin-6. Renal function was normal but lactate levels were elevated. Electrocardiogram demonstrated non-specific changes and troponin-I levels were slightly elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) basal and midventricular akinesia with apex sparing (LV ejection fraction: 30%) and depressed cardiac output (2.8 L/min) consistent with a rare variant of stress-related cardiomyopathy: RTCC. His ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen was < 120. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, plus antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), and prophylactic anticoagulation. Infusion of milrinone failed to improve his cardiogenic shock (day-1). Thus, rescue TPE was performed using the Spectra Optia&#8482; Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA) without protective antibodies. Over 5 days he received daily TPE (each lasting 4 hours). His lactate levels, oxygenation, and LV function normalized and he was weaned off vasopressors. His inflammation markers improved, and he was extubated on day-7. RT-PCR was negative on day-17. He was discharged to home isolation in good condition. CONCLUSION: Stress-cardiomyopathy may complicate the course of fulminant COVID-19 with associated CRS. If inotropic therapy fails, TPE without protective antibodies may help rescue the critically ill patient.","Faqihi, Fahad; Alharthy, Abdulrahman; Alshaya, Rayan; Papanikolaou, John; Kutsogiannis, Demetrios J; Brindley, Peter G; Karakitsos, Dimitrios","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01665-0",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Cardiovasc Disord;20(1): 389, 2020 08 26.; Publication details: BMC Cardiovasc Disord;20(1): 389, 2020 08 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A study on variation of atmospheric pollutants over Bhubaneswar during imposition of nationwide lockdown in India for the COVID-19 pandemic","The nationwide lockdown in India to flatten the pandemic COVID-19 curve has resulted in the reduction of anthropogenic emission sources to a great extent. This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NOx (~ 67 %) and BC (~ 47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~ 14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O3 (~ 3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O3 and NOx during pre-lockdown points to a higher O3 production potential with decreasing NOx. While a reduction in the titration of O3 due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O3 in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O3 values during the later phases of lockdown.","Panda, Subhasmita; Mallik, Chinmay; Nath, Jyotishree; Das, Trupti; Ramasamy, Boopathy","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11869-020-00916-5",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Air Qual Atmos Health;: 1-12, 2020 Aug 24.; Publication details: Air Qual Atmos Health;: 1-12, 2020 Aug 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Le confinement généralisé pendant l'épidémie de Coronavirus : conséquences médico-psychologiques en populations générales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antérieurement de troubles psychiques (Rétrospective concernant les répercussions des risques létaux de masse, modèles scientifiques du confinement collectif, premières observations cliniques, mise en place de contre-mesures et de stratégies thérapeutiques innovantes); [General sanitary containment during the Coronavirus epidemic: Medico-psychological consequences in general population, caregivers, and subjects suffering previously from mental disorders (Retrospective on the repercussions of lethal mass risks, scientific models of collective confinement, first clinical observations, implementation of countermeasures and innovative therapeutic strategies)]","Background: The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective: We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods: We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring. Results: We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion: The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion: Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001",NA,"Country: FR; FRANÇA; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2020 Jun 05.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2020 Jun 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19, Deferred Care and Telemedicine: A Problem, A Solution and a Potential Opportunity","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health systems to proactively reduce care delivery to prepare for an expected surge of hospitalizations. There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects and hopes telemedicine could provide a viable alternative. OBJECTIVE: To measure the extent and reason for care deferral during a health system shutdown, to understand whether telemedicine was acceptable as a care delivery alternative and to estimate whether acceptance of telemedicine had changed during the shutdown. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1,694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. The survey was conducted during the ""lock down"" and while the healthcare system was shut down except for care that could not be delayed. Our mains outcome was respondent report of telemedicine use and care deferral during the shutdown. RESULTS: : Deferred care is widespread - nearly half of respondents deferred care - but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concern about negative health effects. A quarter of those who delayed care were concerned about the health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic and was overwhelmingly viewed as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by those over age 65, female and college educated. Mental health services stood out for high levels of deferred care. CONCLUSIONS: Temporary health system shutdowns will necessarily lead to deferred care. However, much of the deferral will be for preventive services. The health effect can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and moving other service lines to telemedicine. The need for telemedicine options is particularly acute for mental health services.","Atherly, Adam; Van Den Broek-Altenburg, Eline; Hart, Victoria; Gleason, Kelsey; Carney, Jan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21607",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;2020 Aug 13.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;2020 Aug 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Rehabilitation of patients post-COVID-19 infection: a literature review","Rehabilitation is important for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Given the lack of guidelines in English on the rehabilitation of these patients, we conducted a review of the most recent reports. We performed this literature review using the principal research databases and included randomized trials, recommendations, quasi-randomized or prospective controlled clinical trials, reports, guidelines, field updates, and letters to the editor. We identified 107 studies in the database search, among which 85 were excluded after screening the full text or abstract. In total, 22 studies were finally included. The complexity of the clinical setting and the speed of spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which leads to rapid occupation of beds in the intensive care unit, make it necessary to discharge patients with COVID-19 who have mild symptoms as soon as possible. For these reasons, it is necessary to formulate rehabilitation programs for these patients, to help them restore physical and respiratory function and to reduce anxiety and depression, particularly patients with comorbidities and those who live alone or in rural settings, to restore a good quality of life.","Demeco, A; Marotta, N; Barletta, M; Pino, I; Marinaro, C; Petraroli, A; Moggio, L; Ammendolia, Antonio","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300060520948382",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Int Med Res;48(8): 300060520948382, 2020 Aug.; Publication details: J Int Med Res;48(8): 300060520948382, 2020 Aug.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Immediate impact of stay-at-home orders to control COVID-19 transmission on socioeconomic conditions, food insecurity, mental health, and intimate partner violence in Bangladeshi women and their families: an interrupted time series","BACKGROUND: Stay-at-home orders (lockdowns) have been deployed globally to control COVID-19 transmission, and might impair economic conditions and mental health, and exacerbate risk of food insecurity and intimate partner violence. The effect of lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries must be understood to ensure safe deployment of these interventions in less affluent settings. We aimed to determine the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on women and their families in rural Bangladesh. METHODS: An interrupted time series was used to compare data collected from families in Rupganj upazila, rural Bangladesh (randomly selected from participants in a randomised controlled trial), on income, food security, and mental health a median of 1 year and 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to data collected during the lockdown. We also assessed women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. RESULTS: Between May 19 and June 18, 2020, we randomly selected and invited the mothers of 3016 children to participate in the study, 2424 of whom provided consent. 2414 (99·9%, 95% CI 99·6-99·9) of 2417 mothers were aware of, and adhering to, the stay-at-home advice. 2321 (96·0%, 95·2-96·7) of 2417 mothers reported a reduction in paid work for the family. Median monthly family income fell from US$212 at baseline to $59 during lockdown, and the proportion of families earning less than $1·90 per day rose from five (0·2%, 0·0-0·5) of 2422 to 992 (47·3%, 45·2-49·5) of 2096 (p<0·0001 comparing baseline with lockdown period). Before the pandemic, 136 (5·6%, 4·7-6·6) of 2420 and 65 (2·7%, 2·1-3·4) of 2420 families experienced moderate and severe food insecurity, respectively. This increased to 881 (36·5%, 34·5-38·4) of 2417 and 371 (15·3%, 13·9-16·8) of 2417 during the lockdown; the number of families experiencing any level of food insecurity increased by 51·7% (48·1-55·4; p<0·0001). Mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the lockdown. Among women experiencing emotional or moderate physical violence, over half reported it had increased since the lockdown. INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 lockdowns present significant economic, psychosocial, and physical risks to the wellbeing of women and their families across economic strata in rural Bangladesh. Beyond supporting only the most socioeconomically deprived, support is needed for all affected families.

The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women start with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, lead by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage.

"Pain Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Chronic pain management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenging process, especially with growing evidence that COVID-19 infection is associated with myalgias, referred pain, and widespread hyperalgesia. In light of the limited data available for COVID-19-related impact on chronic pain patients, this review explores the changes in the healthcare delivery system due to social distancing and safety precautions to provide the appropriate management of chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding both the general problems facing chronic pain patients as well as specific problems in the COVID-19 era including deconditioning, increased mental health concerns, financial burdens, and potential for medication-induced immune-suppression is vital in the appropriate management of patients. Telemedicine, the practice of caring for patients remotely when the provider and patient are not physically present with each other, is becoming increasingly used and recognized as a valuable tool to both health care providers and patients. This paper concentrates on the proper utilization of the available resources to help patients with the most severe conditions as well as the most vulnerable group. COVID-19 may be associated with a profound effect on both the health care system and patients with chronic pain. As a result, delaying, or stopping, treatment for chronic pain patients will have negative consequences, and strong pain evaluations must be administered to triage patients appropriately. Recent recommendations for the safe use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and interventional pain management procedures are vital to know and understand specifically during the pandemic era. Further researches are needed to identify the advance planning and rapid responses to reduce the impact of the pandemic.","El-Tallawy, Salah N; Nalamasu, Rohit; Pergolizzi, Joseph V; Gharibo, Christopher","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40122-020-00190-4",NA,"Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÂNDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pain Ther;2020 Aug 25.; Publication details: Pain Ther;2020 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: available evidences and a new paradigm","The recent pandemic outbreak of coronavirus is pathogenic and a highly transmittable viral infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). In this time of ongoing pandemic, many emerging reports suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 has inimical effects on neurological functions, and even causes serious neurological damage. The neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome along with many others. The involvement of the CNS may be related with poor prognosis and disease worsening. Here, we review the evidence of nervous system involvement and currently known neurological manifestations in COVID-19 infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. We prioritize the 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to their association with brain-related disease and identified 73 candidate genes. We prioritize these 73 genes according to their spatio-temporal expression in the different regions of brain and also through evolutionary intolerance analysis. The prioritized genes could be considered potential indicators of COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms and thus act as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CNS manifestations associated with COVID-19 patients.","Khatoon, Fatima; Prasad, Kartikay; Kumar, Vijay","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13365-020-00895-4",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Neurovirol;2020 Aug 24.; Publication details: J Neurovirol;2020 Aug 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychiatric Emergency Department Visits - A Descriptive Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) has an important direct and indirect impact on both physical and mental health. We aim to describe the impact of an emergency state period due to COVID-19 on psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits. We conducted a retrospective observational study analysing all emergency visits occurring at a metropolitan psychiatric ED between March 19th and May 2nd 2019 and 2020 (the beginning/end date of the emergency state which Portugal was under due to COVID-19). Data regarding age, sex, diagnoses, admission date, discharge destiny and status were collected. Diagnoses were classified using the International Classification of Diseases version 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). There was a 52·2% decrease on the number of psychiatric emergency visits during the emergency state period (n2020 = 780 vs n2019 = 1633 episodes). The decrease on psychiatric ED visits was greater in the female sex and in the younger age groups. Episodes with a primary diagnosis of Mood disorders lead the decrease on psychiatric ED visits with 68·3% less episodes. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders was the diagnosis group with the smaller decline (9·8% decrease). COVID-19 emergency state period had an important impact on the number and characteristics of psychiatric ED visits, reinforcing the great indirect effects of COVID-19 on mental health.","Gonçalves-Pinho, Manuel; Mota, Pedro; Ribeiro, João; Macedo, Silvério; Freitas, Alberto","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09837-z",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Q;2020 Aug 25.; Publication details: Psychiatr Q;2020 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Eating disorders in times of the COVID-19 pandemic-Results from an online survey of patients with anorexia nervosa","OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public restrictions pose a psychological burden for humans worldwide and may be particularly detrimental for individuals with mental disorders. Therefore, the current study explored effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorder (ED) symptoms and other psychological aspects in former inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN). METHOD: One-hundred and fifty-nine patients with AN-discharged from inpatient treatment in 2019-completed an online survey on contact history with COVID-19, changes in ED symptoms and other psychological aspects, health care utilization, and strategies patients employed to cope during the pandemic. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of patients reported that eating, shape and weight concerns, drive for physical activity, loneliness, sadness, and inner restlessness increased during the pandemic. Access to in-person psychotherapies and visits at the general practitioner (including weight checks) decreased by 37% and 46%, respectively. Videoconference therapy was used by 26% and telephone contacts by 35% of patients. Patients experienced daily routines, day planning and enjoyable activities as the most helpful among the most used coping strategies. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses great challenges to patients with AN. ED-related thoughts and behaviors may be used as dysfunctional coping mechanisms to regain control over the current circumstances. E-mental health interventions appear to be promising for supporting AN patients during these hard times. Furthermore, interventions addressing symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as intolerance of uncertainty might help them manage their ED symptoms.","Schlegl, Sandra; Maier, Julia; Meule, Adrian; Voderholzer, Ulrich","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eat.23374",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Eat Disord;2020 Aug 25.; Publication details: Int J Eat Disord;2020 Aug 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Covid-19, diagnostic difficulties and acute psychosis","Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19, has emerged as an epidemic contributing to more than 247,000 deaths worldwide as of 4th May 2020  It commonly presents with respiratory and occasionally gastrointestinal symptoms  Here we describe a rare case of COVID-19 presenting with acute psychosis which was also complicated by a false negative RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab upon hospital admission  Case Report: A 40 year old, previously fit and healthy male, presented to accident and emergency with respiratory tract symptoms and fever during the COVID-19 outbreak  His first RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab tested negative for COVID-19, but due to a strong clinical suspicion of COVID-19, CT imaging was conducted which justified the sending of a repeat swab  In the meantime, he started to exhibit symptoms of acute psychosis such as hallucinations, paranoid delusions, an attempted suicide, derealisation and depersonalization  Due to failed conservative measures and haloperidol in managing acute psychosis, the patient was intubated for 24 hours  After extubating the patient recovered to baseline within 2 days  Discussion: There are two clinically relevant learning points to be noted from this case report  Firstly, RT-PCR nasopharyngeal COVID-19 swabs are estimated to be only 70-75% sensitive, whereas CT scan changes are estimated to be as high as 97%-98% sensitive  CT imaging can thus be useful when there is a strong suspicion of COVID-19 despite negative nasopharyngeal swabs  Secondly, in order to reduce the work of breathing secondary to agitation, the cross-infection risks to others, and the risk of repeated suicide attempts, this patient was successfully managed with intubation and ventilation, despite the absence of respiratory failure  Conclusion: False negative rate with RT-PCR COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swabs is high and this identifies a crucial diagnostic role for CT Thorax in swab-negative, symptomatic patients with suspected COVID-19  Secondly, acute psychosis is an emerging indication for intubation to consider when managing patients with highly virulent respiratory infections, such as COVID-19","Vepa, A.; Saleem, A.; Dharmaraj, D.; Afzaal, Q.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Covid-19,+diagnostic+difficulties+and+acute+psychosis",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: British Journal of Medical Practitioners;13(1):1-4, 2020.; Publication details: British Journal of Medical Practitioners;13(1):1-4, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Investigation of sleep quality and psychological status of a naval force stationed in Hubei, China during coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic","Objective To understand the sleep quality and psychological status of officers and soldiers in naval force stationed in Hubei, China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, and to explore the influencing factors, so as to maintain the physical and mental health of officers and soldiers during the epidemic. Methods Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scale, patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) and impact of event scale-revised (IES-R) were used to evaluate the sleep and psychological status of officers and soldiers in a naval force stationed in Hubei province. Results A total of 238 questionnaires were sent out, and 232 valid questionnaires were collected, with an effective rate of 97.5%. The median score of PSQI scale was 2.00 (1.00, 5.00), and poor and very poor sleep qualities accounted for 5.6% (13/232) and 0.9% (2/232), respectively. The median score of PHQ-9 was 0.00 (0.00, 2.00), and mild, moderate and severe depression accounted for 12.1% (28/232), 0.9% (2/232) and 0.4% (1/232), respectively. The median score of GAD-7 was 0.00 (0.00, 0.00), and mild anxiety was found in 7.8% (18/232) participants. The median score of IES-R was 1.00 (0.00, 5.00), and mild and moderate psychological stress accounted for 12.5% (29/232) and 1.3% (3/232), respectively. Conclusion The sleep quality and psychological status of the officers and soldiers from the naval force stationed in Hubei are generally good during the COVID-19 epidemic. A small proportion of them have mild psychosomatic disorders, such as poor sleep quality, depression, anxiety and psychological stress reaction. Psychological counseling and humanistic care should be given to better maintain the physical and mental health of naval forces and ensure their combat capability.","Jin-Yang, Li; Ping, Xiao; Yun-Xiang, Tang; Hao, Wang; Shu-Yu, Xu; Jing-Zhou, Xu; Tong, Su","https://doi.org/10.16781/j.0258-879x.2020.06.0633",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Acad.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients awaiting spinal cord stimulation surgery in the United Kingdom: a multi-centre patient survey","Introduction: Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a recommended treatment for chronic refractory neuropathic pain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, elective procedures have been postponed indefinitely both to provide capacity to deal with the emergency caseload and to avoid exposure of elective patients to COVID-19. This survey aimed to explore the effect of the pandemic on chronic pain in this group and the views of patients towards undergoing SCS treatment when routine services should resume. Methods: This was a prospective, multi-centre telephone patient survey that analysed data from 330 patients with chronic pain who were on an SCS waiting list. Questions focussed on severity of pain, effect on mental health, medication consumption and reliance on support networks during the COVID-19 pandemic. Views towards undergoing SCS therapy were also ascertained. Counts and percentages were generated, and chi-square tests of independence explored the impact of COVID-19 risk (very high, high, low) on survey responses. Results: Pain, mental health and patient’s ability to self-manage pain deteriorated in around 47%, 50% and 38% of patients, respectively. Some patients reported increases in pain medication consumption (37%) and reliance on support network (41%). Patients showed a willingness to attend for COVID-19 testing (92%), self-isolate prior to SCS (94%) and undergo the procedure as soon as possible (76%). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that even during the COVID-19 pandemic, there remains a strong clinical need for patients with chronic pain identified as likely SCS responders to be treated quickly. The current prioritisation of new SCS at category 4 (delayed more than 3 months) is challenged judging by this national survey. These patients are awaiting SCS surgery to relieve severe intractable neuropathic pain. A priority at category 3 (delayed up to 3 months) or in some selected cases, at category 2 are the appropriate priority categories.","Baranidharan, Ganesan; Bretherton, Beatrice; Eldabe, Sam; Mehta, Vivek; Thomson, Simon; Sharma, Manohar Lal; Vajramani, Girish; Bojanic, Stana; Gulve, Ashish; FitzGerald, James; Hall, Samuel; Firth, Julie","https://doi.org/10.1177/2049463720948092",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Br.

"Cutting-edge technologies for small business and innovation in the era of COVID-19 global health pandemic","The adoption of cutting-edge technologies to steer business activities during community lockdown to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, even if involuntarily, provides evidence that technologies not only offer competitive advantages but also provides a means for survival, by improvising existing business models. In June 2019, we issued a call for papers to address the awareness, adoption, and implementation challenges of technologies that can drive businesses of all sizes in the fourth industrial revolution. We intended to identify as critical elements the “must-have” and a “nice to have” technologies for small businesses and innovation. Then the ongoing COVID-19 global health pandemic struck in December 2019, forcing the need for digitization of business activities and remote operations, which was considered a “nice to have” to immediately become a “critical to have” to survive in the ever increasingly uncertain business environment. This paper identifies the technologies, evaluates disruptive software platforms, and strategies needed for creating and managing small business innovation and highlighting the complexity of that process and the context within which this process takes place. We integrate this discussion alongside a summary of the articles included in the Special Issue. The current realities show that technologies that enable social business creation, customer relationship management systems, new communications channels, virtual reality technologies for remote operations, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are crucial to lowering the costs of doing business. Big data and predictive and visual analytics are critical enablers to aiding complex business decisions in the current challenging business climate.","Akpan, Ikpe Justice; Soopramanien, Didier; Kwak, Dong-Heon","https://doi.org/10.1080/08276331.2020.1799294",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Personality and perceived stress during COVID-19 pandemic: Testing the mediating role of perceived threat and efficacy","Prolonged stress is associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes. Understanding the mediators between personality and stress is critical for developing effective stress management interventions during a pandemic. Our study explored whether perceptions of threat from COVID-19 and efficacy to follow government recommendations for preventing COVID-19 would mediate the relationships between personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness-goal-striving, extroversion-activity and sociability) and perceived stress. In an online survey of a representative sample of Canadian adults (n = 1055), we found that higher neuroticism and extroversion were associated with higher levels of stress during the pandemic and a greater increase in stress levels compared to levels before the pandemic. Perceived threat and efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism and stress, which suggested that individuals with higher neuroticism experienced higher levels of stress due to higher levels of perceived threat and lower levels of efficacy. Perceived threat did not mediate the relationship between extroverts and stress, which suggested that the source of stress may stem from elsewhere (e.g., inability to socialize). Our findings highlighted that personality traits could be an important factor in identifying stress-prone individuals during a pandemic and that stress management interventions need to be personality specific.","Liu, Sam; Lithopoulos, Alexander; Zhang, Chun-Qing; Garcia-Barrera, Mauricio A.; Rhodes, Ryan E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110351",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Pers.

"Time from COVID-19 shutdown, gender-based violence exposure, and mental health outcomes among a state representative sample of California residents","Background: There is increasing evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant shutdowns on mental health. This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. Findings: Nearly one in five (19•7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15•5% had a history of IPV and 10•1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. Interpretation: Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

"Addressing Postpandemic Clinician Mental Health : A Narrative Review and Conceptual Framework","Previous pandemics have seen high psychiatric morbidity among health care workers. Protecting clinician mental health in the aftermath of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires an evidence-based approach to developing and deploying comprehensive clinician mental health support. In a narrative review of 96 articles addressing clinician mental health in COVID-19 and prior pandemics, 7 themes emerged: 1) the need for resilience and stress reduction training; 2) providing for clinicians' basic needs (food, drink, adequate rest, quarantine-appropriate housing, transportation, child care, personal protective equipment); 3) the importance of specialized training for pandemic-induced changes in job roles; 4) recognition and clear communication from leadership; 5) acknowledgment of and strategies for addressing moral injury; 6) the need for peer and social support interventions; and 7) normalization and provision of mental health support programs. In addition to the literature review, in collaboration with the Collaborative for Healing and Renewal in Medicine (CHARM) network, the authors gathered practice guidelines and resources from health care organizations and professional societies worldwide to synthesize a list of resources deemed high-yield by well-being leaders. Studies of previous pandemics demonstrate heightened distress in health care workers years after the event. The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges that surpass those of previous pandemics, suggesting a significant mental health toll on clinicians. Long-term, proactive individual, organizational, and societal infrastructures for clinician mental health support are needed to mitigate the psychological costs of providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schwartz, Rachel; Sinskey, Jina L; Anand, Uma; Margolis, Rebecca D","https://dx.doi.org/10.7326/M20-4199",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Intern Med;2020 Aug 21.; Publication details: Ann Intern Med;2020 Aug 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Asia Pacific Disaster Mental Health Network: Setting a Mental Health Agenda for the Region","Addressing the psychological mechanisms and structural inequalities that underpin mental health issues is critical to recovery following disasters and pandemics. The Asia Pacific Disaster Mental Health Network was established in June 2020 in response to the current disaster climate and to foster advancements in disaster-oriented mental health research, practice and policy across the region. Supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health EDRM), the network brings together leading disaster psychiatry, psychology and public health experts. Our aim is to advance policy, research and targeted translation of the evidence so that communities are better informed in preparation and response to disasters, pandemics and mass trauma. The first meetings of the network resulted in the development of a regional disaster mental health agenda focused on the current context, with five priority areas: (1) Strengthening community engagement and the integration of diverse perspectives in planning, implementing and evaluating mental health and psychosocial response in disasters; (2) Supporting and assessing the capacity of mental health systems to respond to disasters; (3) Optimising emerging technologies in mental healthcare; (4) Understanding and responding appropriately to addressing the mental health impacts of climate change; (5) Prioritising mental health and psychosocial support for high-risk groups. Consideration of these priority areas in future research, practice and policy will support nuanced and effective psychosocial initiatives for disaster-affected populations within the Asia Pacific region.","Newnham, Elizabeth A; Dzidic, Peta L; Mergelsberg, Enrique L P; Guragain, Bhushan; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Kim, Yoshiharu; Leaning, Jennifer; Kayano, Ryoma; Wright, Michael; Kaththiriarachchi, Lalindra; Kato, Hiroshi; Osawa, Tomoko; Gibbs, Lisa","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176144",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 08 24.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(17)2020 08 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prognostic factors in Spanish COVID-19 patients: A case series from Barcelona","BACKGROUND: In addition to the lack of COVID-19 diagnostic tests for the whole Spanish population, the current strategy is to identify the disease early to limit contagion in the community. AIM: To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive, observational, retrospective study in three primary healthcare centres with an assigned population of 100,000. METHOD: Examination of the medical records of patients with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic multivariate regression models adjusted for age and sex were constructed to analyse independent predictive factors associated with death, ICU admission and hospitalization. RESULTS: We included 322 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 50% female, 115 (35.7%) aged &#8805; 65 years): 123 (38.2) were health workers (doctors, nurses, auxiliaries). Predictors of ICU admission or death were greater age (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.03 to 1.07), male sex (OR = 2.94; 95%CI = 1.55 to 5.82), autoimmune disease (OR = 2.82; 95%CI = 1.00 to 7.84), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (OR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.41 to 6.13), elevated lactate-dehydrogenase (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.28 to 6.90), elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.22 to 6.98) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 2.38; 95%CI = 1.22 to 4.68). Myalgia or arthralgia (OR = 0.31; 95%CI = 0.12 to 0.70) was protective factor against ICU admission and death.

"Factors associated with resilience among non-local medical workers sent to Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: To investigate the resilience of non-local medical workers sent to support local medical workers in treating the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). METHODS: In February 2020, non-local medical workers who had been sent to Wuhan as support staff to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak were asked to complete an online survey composed of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). RESULTS: Survey responses from 114 non-local medical workers were analyzed. CD-RISC scores were high (67.03 ± 13.22). The resilience level was highest for physicians (73.48 ± 11.49), followed by support staff, including health care assistants, technicians (67.78 ± 12.43) and nurses (64.86 ± 13.46). Respondents differed significantly in the levels of education, training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital (where he or she normally works), and in their feelings of being adequately prepared and confident to complete tasks (P < 0.05). Resilience correlated negatively with anxiety (r = -.498, P < 0.01) and depression (r = -.471, P < 0.01) but positively with active coping styles (r = .733, P < 0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed that active coping (ß = 1.314, p < 0.05), depression (ß = -.806, p < 0.05), anxiety (ß = - 1.091, p < 0.05), and training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital (ß = 3.510, p < 0.05) were significant associated with resilience. CONCLUSION: Our data show that active coping, depression, anxiety, and training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital are associated with resilience. Managers of medical staff should use these data to develop psychosocial interventions aimed at reinforcing the resilience of medical workers during highly stressful and prolonged medical emergencies, as seen during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Lin, Jing; Ren, Yun-Hong; Gan, Hai-Jie; Chen, Ying; Huang, Ying-Fan; You, Xue-Mei","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02821-8",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 417, 2020 08 24.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 417, 2020 08 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID pandemic as an opportunity for improving mental health treatments of the homeless people","BACKGROUND: Homeless population has been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Their living conditions, comorbidity with different pathologies and a greater frequency of mental disorders, make this population vulnerable. METHOD: We implemented a program of serial visits in a hostel for confined homeless of the city council social services, for the monitoring and treatment of mental disorders and substance abuse problems. Accompanied by serial phone and email contacts. RESULTS: A highly significant percentage (63%) had mental disorders or substance abuse, requiring pharmacological intervention, and 37% began follow-up in resources of the Mental Health and Addiction network of the Psychiatric Service at the end of the program. Hospital emergency service visits were drastically reduced. None of them were infected with COVID-19.

"The burden of alcohol on health care during COVID-19","Alcohol's impact on global health is substantial and of a similar order of magnitude to that from COVID-19. Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105 065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10 521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5 months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health-care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced. In particular, we recommend increases in excise taxation coupled with minimum unit pricing to both reduce impacts on health-care services and provide much-needed revenues for governments at this critical time.","Stockwell, Tim; Andreasson, Sven; Cherpitel, Cheryl; Chikritzhs, Tanya; Dangardt, Frida; Holder, Harold; Naimi, Timothy; Sherk, Adam","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/dar.13143",NA,"Country: AU; AUSTRÁLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Drug Alcohol Rev;2020 Aug 24.; Publication details: Drug Alcohol Rev;2020 Aug 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis?","COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first 'Green Deal' initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines","BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies' mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. METHODS: A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. RESULTS: The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors' abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). LIMITATIONS: An English online survey was used. CONCLUSION: During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact. The factors identified can be used to devise effective psychological support strategies.","Tee, Michael L; Tee, Cherica A; Anlacan, Joseph P; Aligam, Katrina Joy G; Reyes, Patrick Wincy C; Kuruchittham, Vipat; Ho, Roger C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.043",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;277: 379-391, 2020 Aug 24.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;277: 379-391, 2020 Aug 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. METHOD: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). LIMITATIONS: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. CONCLUSION: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.","Serrano-Ripoll, Maria J; Meneses-Echavez, Jose F; Ricci-Cabello, Ignacio; Fraile-Navarro, David; Fiol-deRoque, Maria A; Pastor-Moreno, Guadalupe; Castro, Adoración; Ruiz-Pérez, Isabel; Zamanillo Campos, Rocío; Gonçalves-Bradley, Daniela C","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;277: 347-357, 2020 Aug 23.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;277: 347-357, 2020 Aug 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health interventions and supports during COVID- 19 and other medical pandemics: A rapid systematic review of the evidence","BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a global reminder of the need to attend to the mental health of patients and health professionals who are suddenly facing this public health crisis. In the last two decades, a number of medical pandemics have yielded insights on the mental health impact of these events. Based on these experiences and given the magnitude of the current pandemic, rates of mental health disorders are expected to increase. Mental health interventions are urgently needed to minimize the psychological sequelae and provide timely care to affected individuals. METHOD: We conducted a rapid systematic review of mental health interventions during a medical pandemic, using three electronic databases. Of the 2404 articles identified, 21 primary research studies are included in this review. RESULT: We categorized the findings from the research studies using the following questions: What kind of emotional reactions do medical pandemics trigger? Who is most at risk of experiencing mental health sequelae? What works to treat mental health sequelae (psychosocial interventions and implementation of existing or new training programs)? What do we need to consider when designing and implementing mental health interventions (cultural adaptations and mental health workforce)? What still needs to be known? CONCLUSION: Various mental health interventions have been developed for medical pandemics, and research on their effectiveness is growing. We offer recommendations for future research based on the evidence for providing mental health interventions and supports to those most in need.","Soklaridis, Sophie; Lin, Elizabeth; Lalani, Yasmin; Rodak, Terri; Sockalingam, Sanjeev","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.08.007",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gen Hosp Psychiatry;66: 133-146, 2020 Aug 22.; Publication details: Gen Hosp Psychiatry;66: 133-146, 2020 Aug 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Material hardship and parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of grandparents' mental health","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of many families, including grandparent kinship families, to deal with a health/economic crisis. The fear of COVID-19 plus stay-at-home orders have increased individuals' psychological distress. Moreover, school closures and homeschooling further increased parenting stress among caregivers. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the relationship between material hardship and parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers, and assessed grandparents' mental health as a potential mediator to this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Grandparent kinship providers (N = 362) that took primary care of their grandchildren participated in a cross-sectional survey via Qualtrics Panels in June 2020 in the United States. METHODS: Descriptive and bivariate analyses, binary logistic regression, and mediation analyses were conducted using STATA 15.0. RESULTS: Suffering material hardship was significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers, and grandparents' mental health partially mediated this association. CONCLUSIONS: Addressing material and mental health needs among grandparent kinship providers is critical to decreasing their parenting stress.","Xu, Yanfeng; Wu, Qi; Levkoff, Sue E; Jedwab, Merav","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104700",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104700, 2020 Aug 24.; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104700, 2020 Aug 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Do suicide rates in children and adolescents change during school closure in Japan? The acute effect of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted the lives of children and adolescents. School closure, one of the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in social contacts and increases in family time for children and adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of suicide is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during school closure in Japan. DATA: Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020. METHODS: Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020. Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also performed. RESULTS: We found no significant change in suicide rates during the school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.","Isumi, Aya; Doi, Satomi; Yamaoka, Yui; Takahashi, Kunihiko; Fujiwara, Takeo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104680",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104680, 2020 Aug 23.; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104680, 2020 Aug 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Evidence for the Effectiveness of Remdesivir (GS-5734), a Nucleoside-Analog Antiviral Drug in the Inhibition of I K(M)or I K(DR)and in the Stimulation of I MEP","Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in the class of nucleotide analogs, has been particularly tailored for treatment of coronavirus infections. However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH 3cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH 3cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of I K(DR)elicitation with effective IC 50values of 10.1 or 2.8 µM, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR)on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 µM. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of I K(DR)was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of I K(DR)failed to be overcome by further addition of either a,ß-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K +current with the IC 50value of 2.5 µM. The magnitude of voltage hysteresis of I K(M)elicited by long-lasting triangular ramp pulse was diminished by adding RDV. Membrane electroporation-induced current in response to large hyperpolarization was enhanced, with an EC 50value of 5.8 µM. Likewise, in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, adding RDV declined I K(DR)amplitude concomitantly with the raised rate of current inactivation applied by step depolarization. Therefore, in terms of the RDV molecule, there appears to be an unintended activity of the prodrug on ion channels. Its inhibition of both I K(DR)and I K(M)occurring in a non-genomic fashion might provide additional but important mechanisms through which in vivo cellular functions are seriously perturbed.","Chang, Wei-Ting; Liu, Ping-Yen; Gao, Zi-Han; Lee, Shih-Wei; Lee, Wen-Kai; Wu, Sheng-Nan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01091",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Front.

"Quality improvement report: setting up a staff well-being hub through continuous engagement","The coronavirus pandemic has presented a new set of challenges for the frontline National Health Service staff. It is not only the long working hours but also the uncertainty and increase in patient mortality that has affected mental health and staff well-being. Hospitals all around the country have rightly responded with various well-being initiatives to help their staff such as wobble rooms and developing online resources. Our vision was to set up a safe space for staff away from clinical noise to enable and encourage mindfulness and psychological resilience through a calm and serene environment. We used the continuous quality improvement methodology and administered an initial needs assessment survey to see if our trust staff will be interested in having such a space. Within our team, we managed to secure a place, and used donations to hospital charity and set up a space within a week. Since opening the hub, we have had excellent feedback from various staff groups. Immediate feedback was obtained using emoji stickers asking for feelings before and after visit. A mood board was put up allowing anonymous expression of feelings. Delayed feedback was requested using a repeat survey. We believe that while there is a lot of talk about well-being and an increasing number of resources being offered electronically, the need for a neat and quiet space cannot be overlooked. We collect feedback on a weekly basis and adapt the space to meet the needs of staff. Long-term impact of such spaces will be reassessed at a later stage.","Saqib, Aaisha; Rampal, Tarannum","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001008",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open Qual;9(3)2020 Aug.; Publication details: BMJ Open Qual;9(3)2020 Aug.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This mode can provide a valuable reference for the emergency training of nurses in the future.","Zhou, Min; Yuan, Fei; Zhao, Xiaolong; Xi, Fanjie; Wen, Xianxiu; Zeng, Li; Zeng, Wenbo; Wu, Haiyan; Zeng, Hui; Zhao, Ziyu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/nop2.580",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Nurs Open;2020 Aug 04.; Publication details: Nurs Open;2020 Aug 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological responses and lifestyle changes among pregnant women with respect to the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a profound impact on health and well-being of populations. However, there are limited studies that have investigated the psychological aspects of vulnerable groups including pregnant women amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese pregnant women from February 2020 until March 2020. METHODS: Our study was conducted using a modified validated online questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic, the Impact of Event Scale (IES), attitude and mental health-related questions towards COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 560 women were included. The overall mean age and IES of women was 25.8 ± 2.7 years and 31.4 ± 13.7. Moreover, 67.1% of them had IES â©¾26. Psychological impact seemed to be more severe in women in second trimester of pregnancy (the highest IES) (p = .016). There was a significant association between trimesters of pregnancy and some indicators of negative health impacts (including increased stress from work, increased stress from home, feeling apprehensive and helpless during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic) (all p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Our results reported moderate-to-severe stressful impact among Chinese pregnant women.

"Acute stress disorder among frontline health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak: A structural equation modelling investigation","OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of COVID-19 that commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused extensive public health concerns and posed substantial challenges to health professionals, especially for those in the center of the epidemic. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. METHODS: The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. RESULTS: A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ß=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, YuanYuan; Duan, Zhizhou; Peng, Ke; Li, Dan; Ou, Jianjun; Wilson, Amanda; Wang, Nan; Si, Lei; Chen, Runsen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000851",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychosom Med;2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Psychosom Med;2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being of people living with HIV: A cross-sectional survey","BACKGROUND: Empirical data on the consequences of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on HIV care is lacking. We surveyed persons living with HIV (PLWH) in different countries to investigate whether their medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being had been compromised due to COVID-19 and associated restrictions. METHODS: In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. RESULTS: 317 PLWH were included (mean age 43.4±11.7; 71.6% male); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. 140 (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, while 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders. Fifty-six (17.7%) respondents reported difficulties in obtaining antiretroviral medications because of COVID-19-related measures. Adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 outbreak included greater quantities of antiretroviral refill in 67 (21.1%), phone consultations in 25 (7.9%), and new refill sites in 12 (3.9%). Factors associated with reduced risk of experiencing flu-like symptoms included flu vaccination during the last 12 months (p=0.005) and adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.010). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 and associated restrictive measures seem detrimental to the well-being and follow-up of PLWH. We recommend that health systems devise innovative approaches for antiretroviral provision and psychosocial support to PLWH during such outbreaks.","Siewe Fodjo, Joseph Nelson; Faria de Moura Villela, Edlaine; Van Hees, Stijn; Tibério Dos Santos, Thalia; Vanholder, Pieter; Vanholder, Pieter; Reyntiens, Patrick; Van den Bergh, Rafael; Colebunders, Robert","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002468",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr;2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr;2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The COVID-19 telepsychology revolution: A national study of pandemic-based changes in US mental health care delivery","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered mental health care delivery like no other event in modern history. The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.

"Comparing eating behaviours, and symptoms of depression and anxiety between Spain and Greece during the COVID-19 outbreak: Cross-sectional analysis of two different confinement strategies","OBJECTIVE: We compared eating behaviours, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in two countries with different confinement strictness strategies and different levels of COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered during and shortly after the COVID-19 related lockdown in Spain and Greece. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify country differences associated with eating behaviour, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. RESULTS: This study included 1,002 responders in Spain and 839 in Greece. The mean ± SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5 ± 0.79, 2.1 ± 0.81 and 2.6 ± 0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7 ± 0.85, 2.3 ± 0.99 and 2.9 ± 0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (p < .001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%. After adjusting for several risk factors, a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in Spain compared to Greece (p = .001), but no difference was seen for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated high scores of inappropriate eating behaviours and a high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in two Mediterranean countries during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings revealed that compared to Greek participants, Spanish participants, that faced more severe COVID-19 pandemic and stricter lockdown measures, were associated with lower restraint and external eating and increased anxiety symptoms, but not with depressive symptoms or emotional eating.","Papandreou, Christopher; Arija, Victoria; Aretouli, Eleni; Tsilidis, Konstantinos K; Bulló, Mònica","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/erv.2772",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Eat Disord Rev;2020 Aug 04.; Publication details: Eur Eat Disord Rev;2020 Aug 04.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The mental health of immigrants and refugees: Canadian evidence from a nationally linked database","BACKGROUND: Few studies of the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) have examined the mental health outcomes of Canadian-born individuals on a national scale compared with immigrants by admission category. This study fills this gap by examining the self-reported mental health (SRMH) of immigrants by admission category and other immigration dimensions (e.g., source world region and duration since landing) and making comparisons with Canadian-born respondents to a population-based survey. DATA AND METHODS: Based on four cycles (2011 to 2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), odds ratios of high (i.e., excellent or very good) SRMH among Canadian-born respondents and IMDB-linked immigrants are compared using logistic regression. Among the IMDB immigrant population, high SRMH was also examined according to the above-mentioned immigration dimensions. Adjusted results were hierarchically controlled for age, sex, social and economic factors, and sense of belonging. RESULTS: Age-sex adjusted results show that immigrants, especially refugees, are less likely than the Canadian-born population to report high mental health levels, but these differences disappeared after full adjustment. The odds of immigrants having high SRMH differed more by source world region and duration since landing. For example, fully adjusted results show support for the HIE, with recent immigrants (interviewed within 10 years of landing) more likely to report high SRMH than either the Canadian-born population or established immigrants. Greater odds of high SRMH among recent immigrants also holds across admission classes and for selected world regions. DISCUSSION: This study provides new evidence on differences in mental health between Canadian-born individuals and immigrants by various characteristics. Results support a deterioration of the HIE in SRMH and identify factors significantly associated with SRMH. This study can also serve as a baseline for further studies on the impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' mental health by immigrant category.","Ng, Edward; Zhang, Haozhen","https://dx.doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000800001-eng",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Rep;31(8): 3-12, 2020 08 19.; Publication details: Health Rep;31(8): 3-12, 2020 08 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Unspoken inequality: how COVID-19 has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities of asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in South Africa","An estimated 2 million foreign-born migrants of working age (15-64) were living in South Africa (SA) in 2017. Structural and practical xenophobia has driven asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in SA to abject poverty and misery. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) containment measures adopted by the SA government through the lockdown of the nation have tremendously deepened the unequal treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees in SA. This can be seen through the South African government's lack of consideration of this marginalized population in economic, poverty, and hunger alleviation schemes. Leaving this category of our society out of the national response safety nets may lead to negative coping strategies causing mental health issues and secondary health concerns. An effective response to the socioeconomic challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the economic and health impact of the pandemic on asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants.","Mukumbang, Ferdinand C; Ambe, Anthony N; Adebiyi, Babatope O","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01259-4",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Equity Health;19(1): 141, 2020 08 20.; Publication details: Int J Equity Health;19(1): 141, 2020 08 20.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Health Status Disparities; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Refugees/statistics & numerical data; Undocumented Immigrants/statistics & numerical data; Vulnerable Populations/statistics & numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Coronavirus Infections/prevention & control; Government; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention & control; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa/epidemiology; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Health Inequalities in the Use of Telehealth in the United States in the Lens of COVID-19","The use of remote health care services, or telehealth, is a promising solution for providing health care to those unable to access care in person easily and thus helping to reduce health inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders in the United States have created an optimal situation for the use of telehealth services for non-life-threatening health care use. A retrospective cohort study was performed using Kantar's Claritis&#8482; database, which links insurance claims encounters (Komodo Health) with patient-reported data (Kantar Health, National Health & Wellness Survey). Logistic regression models (odds ratios [OR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]) examined predictors of telehealth versus in-person encounters. Adults ages &#8805;18 years eligible for payer-complete health care encounters in both March 2019 and March 2020 were identified (n = 35,376). Telehealth use increased from 0.2% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020. In adjusted models of respondents with &#8805;1 health care encounter (n = 11,614), age, marital status, geographic residence (region; urban/rural), and presence of anxiety or depression were significant predictors of telehealth compared with in-person use in March 2020. For example, adults 45-46 years versus 18-44 years were less likely to use telehealth (OR 0.684, 95% CI: 0.561-0.834), and respondents living in urban versus rural areas were more likely to use telehealth (OR 1.543, 95% CI: 1.153-2.067). Substantial increases in telehealth use were observed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; however, disparities existed. These inequalities represent the baseline landscape that population health management must monitor and address during this pandemic.","Jaffe, Dena H; Lee, Lulu; Huynh, Stephanie; Haskell, Thomas P","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0186",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Popul Health Manag;2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: Popul Health Manag;2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Demographic perspectives on the mortality of COVID-19 and other epidemics","To put estimates of COVID-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes 1 million US lives, with results approximately scalable over a broad range of deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 2.94 y) and remaining life years (11.7 y per death). Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 trillion person years of life lost would be valued at $10.2 to $17.5 trillion. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality in other countries are quite similar and increase at rates close to each country's rate for all-cause mortality. The scenario of 1 million COVID-19 deaths is similar in scale to that of the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than that of the Spanish flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in a period of months rather than spread out over decades.","Goldstein, Joshua R; Lee, Ronald D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006392117",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A;2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A;2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around: Couple and Family Coping During the Coronavirus Pandemic","The worldwide coronavirus (COVID-19) has had profound effects on all aspects of life: physical health, the ability to travel locally or to more distant destinations, material and financial resources, and psychosocial wellbeing. Couples, families, and communities and individual persons in those relationships have struggled to cope with emerging depression, anxiety, and trauma, and the rise of relational conflict. In this article, we suggest that the existential nature of the pandemic's challenges requires more than just the usual psychosocial interventions. We propose a taxonomy of responses to foster coping and resilience-""Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around."" ""Reaching Up"" includes accessing spiritual, religious, and ethical values. ""Reaching Down"" includes ideas and practices that foster a revised relationship with the Earth and its resources, and that engage families to participate in activities that aid the Earth's recovery from decades of human-caused damage. ""Reaching In"" represents a turn towards experiences available in the mind and in shared minds in relationships that provide pleasure, excitement, joy, and peace, given that external sources of these emotions are of limited availability due to quarantine. ""Reaching Around"" involves reframing the mandate for ""social distancing"" as fostering social connection and support while maintaining physical distancing. The challenges for family therapists, whose practices are confined largely to online therapy, and who are struggling with the same fears and constraints as those persons they are attempting to help, are also discussed.","Fraenkel, Peter; Cho, Wonyoung L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/famp.12570",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Fam Process;2020 Jun 26.; Publication details: Fam Process;2020 Jun 26.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health Care Goes Online: Practitioners' Experiences of Providing Mental Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated sudden and radical changes in mental health care delivery, as strict social distancing and lockdown measures were imposed in the early phases of the pandemic. Almost overnight, practitioners were forced to transfer their face-to-face care practice to online means. To understand the implications of this drastic change for mental health care, and to improve the online care offerings, an online qualitative survey was held among mental health care professionals in Netherlands (n = 51). Our findings indicate that technological and usability problems pose a significant challenge, as do difficulties to establish rapport with clients. Moreover, not all mental health issues and treatment forms are equally amenable to online interaction. In contrast, in many instances, practitioners were positive about the effectiveness of treatment, and reported flexibility, a lower threshold for contact, and lack of travel time as advantages. Their most prominent needs concern better technological, organizational, and logistical support. It is critical that these needs are acted upon by institutions and governments. In addition, current results inform future research on the improvement of e-mental health technologies.","Feijt, Milou; de Kort, Yvonne; Bongers, Inge; Bierbooms, Joyce; Westerink, Joyce; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0370",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The majority of participants (99%) reported having heard of COVID-19; 23% reported no longer being able to go outside, 17% reported that they could no longer go to their regular clinic for medical care, and 3% reported that they could no longer get medication refills. PHQ-9 screening identified 9% (n = 45) with mild depression symptoms, and 1% (n = 3) with moderate-to-severe depression symptoms. Young adults 20-24 years old had more mild to severe depressive symptoms than the younger age groups (p < 0.001).

"COVID-19: a probable role of the anticoagulant Protein S in managing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused monumental mortality, and there are still no adequate therapies. Most severely ill COVID-19 patients manifest a hyperactivated immune response, instigated by interleukin 6 (IL6) that triggers a so called ""cytokine storm"" and coagulopathy. Hypoxia is also associated with COVID-19. So far overlooked is the fact that both IL6 and hypoxia depress the abundance of a key anticoagulant, Protein S. We speculate that the IL6-driven cytokine explosion plus hypoxemia causes a severe drop in Protein S level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients. Here we highlight a mechanism by which the IL6-hypoxia curse causes a deadly hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients, and we suggest a path to therapy.","Chatterjee, Sabyasachi; Sengupta, Tanusree; Majumder, Samarpan; Majumder, Rinku","https://dx.doi.org/10.18632/aging.103869",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Aging (Albany NY);122020 Aug 19.; Publication details: Aging (Albany NY);122020 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What the world could learn from the Haitian resilience while managing COVID-19","In the 1st trimester of 2020, there were mixed feelings among Haitians about the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In effect, many of the concerns emanating from the relatively weak health infrastructure in Haiti were analyzed from a resilience perspective. Many professionals living in Haiti with whom we have conversed believe that Haitians were better prepared to cope with the social distancing and mental health outcomes associated with the pandemic because of their 3-month exposure to the effects of Peyi Lòk (""country in lockdown"") as well as previous major natural disasters. In that regard, previous traumatic exposures may serve as a buffer against the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Haitians. For the past 3 months, Haitians have naturally adopted a practical posture to cope with the pandemic where only school buildings are closed. Consequently, we remain convinced that from a psychological perspective, individuals from high-income countries that are severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic could learn from the Haitian way of coping with large-scale disasters.

"Resilience, COVID-19-related stress, anxiety and depression during the pandemic in a large population enriched for healthcare providers","COVID-19 pandemic is a global calamity posing an unprecedented opportunity to study resilience. We developed a brief resilience survey probing self-reliance, emotion-regulation, interpersonal-relationship patterns and neighborhood-environment, and applied it online during the acute COVID-19 outbreak (April 6-15, 2020), on a crowdsourcing research website ( www.covid19resilience.org ) advertised through social media. We evaluated level of stress (worries) regarding COVID-19: (1) contracting, (2) dying from, (3) currently having, (4) family member contracting, (5) unknowingly infecting others with (6) experiencing significant financial burden following. Anxiety (GAD7) and depression (PHQ2) were measured. Totally, 3042 participants (n = 1964 females, age range 18-79, mean age = 39) completed the resilience and COVID-19-related stress survey and 1350 of them (mean age = 41, SD = 13; n = 997 females) completed GAD7 and PHQ2. Participants significantly endorsed more distress about family contracting COVID-19 (48.5%) and unknowingly infecting others (36%), than getting COVID-19 themselves (19.9%), p < 0.0005 covarying for demographics and proxy COVID-19 exposures like getting tested and knowing infected individuals. Patterns of COVID-19 related worries, rates of anxiety (GAD7 > 10, 22.2%) and depression (PHQ2 > 2, 16.1%) did not differ between healthcare providers and non-healthcare providers. Higher resilience scores were associated with lower COVID-19 related worries (main effect F1,3054 = 134.9; p < 0.00001, covarying for confounders). Increase in 1 SD on resilience score was associated with reduced rate of anxiety (65%) and depression (69%), across healthcare and non-healthcare professionals.

"Impact of the societal response to COVID-19 on access to healthcare for non-COVID-19 health issues in slum communities of Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan: results of pre-COVID and COVID-19 lockdown stakeholder engagements","INTRODUCTION: With COVID-19, there is urgency for policymakers to understand and respond to the health needs of slum communities. Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. METHODS: In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. RESULTS: Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. CONCLUSION: Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","Ahmed, Syed A K Shifat; Ajisola, Motunrayo; Azeem, Kehkashan; Bakibinga, Pauline; Chen, Yen-Fu; Choudhury, Nazratun Nayeem; Fayehun, Olufunke; Griffiths, Frances; Harris, Bronwyn; Kibe, Peter; Lilford, Richard J; Omigbodun, Akinyinka; Rizvi, Narjis; Sartori, Jo; Smith, Simon; Watson, Samuel I; Wilson, Ria; Yeboah, Godwin; Aujla, Navneet; Azam, Syed Iqbal; Diggle, Peter J; Gill, Paramjit; Iqbal, Romaina; Kabaria, Caroline; Kisia, Lyagamula; Kyobutungi, Catherine; Madan, Jason J; Mberu, Blessing; Mohamed, Shukri F; Nazish, Ahsana; Odubanjo, Oladoyin; Osuh, Mary E; Owoaje, Eme; Oyebode, Oyinlola; Porto de Albuquerque, Joao; Rahman, Omar; Tabani, Komal; Taiwo, Olalekan John; Tregonning, Grant; Uthman, Olalekan A; Yusuf, Rita","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003042",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Glob Health;5(8)2020 08.; Publication details: BMJ Glob Health;5(8)2020 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"""The COVID-19 Pandemic and its Effect on Mental Health in USA - A Review with Some Coping Strategies""","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in enormous losses in terms of human lives and economy in United States. The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2 weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses.

"Cellular and Molecular Pathways of COVID-19 and Potential Points of Therapeutic Intervention","With the objective of linking early findings relating to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with potentially informative findings from prior research literature and to promote investigation toward therapeutic response, a coherent cellular and molecular pathway is proposed for COVID-19  The pathway is consistent with a broad range of observed clinical features and biological markers and captures key mediators of pathophysiology  In this proposed pathway, membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus via ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, including pulmonary type-II pneumocytes, provoke an initial immune response featuring inflammatory cytokine production coupled with a weak interferon response, particularly in IFN-<U+03BB>–dependent epithelial defense  Differentiation of non-classic pathogenic T-cells and pro-inflammatory intermediate monocytes contributes to a skewed inflammatory profile, mediated by membrane-bound immune receptor subtypes (e g , Fc<U+03B3>RIIA) and downstream signaling pathways (e g , NF-<U+03BA>B p65 and p38 MAPK), followed by chemotactic infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils into lung tissue  Endothelial barrier degradation and capillary leakage contribute to alveolar cell damage  Inflammatory cytokine release, delayed neutrophil apoptosis, and NETosis contribute to pulmonary thrombosis and cytokine storm  These mechanisms are concordant with observed clinical markers in COVID-19, including high expression of inflammatory cytokines on the TNF-a/IL-6 axis, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), diffuse alveolar damage via cell apoptosis in respiratory epithelia and vascular endothelia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CRP, high production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), depressed platelet count, and thrombosis  Although certain elements are likely to be revised as new findings emerge, the proposed pathway suggests multiple points of investigation for potential therapeutic interventions  Initial candidate interventions include prophylaxis to augment epithelial defense (e g , AT1 receptor blockade, type III and type I interferons, melatonin, calcitriol, camostat, and lopinavir) and to reduce viral load (e g , remdesivir, ivermectin, emetine, Abelson kinase inhibitors, dopamine D2 antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor modulators)  Additional interventions focus on tempering inflammatory signaling and injury (e g , dexamethasone, doxycycline, Ang1-7, estradiol, alpha blockers, and DHA/EPA, pasireotide), as well as inhibitors targeted toward molecular mediators of the maladaptive COVID-19 immune response (e g , IL-6, TNF-a, IL-17, JAK, and CDK9)","Hussman, J.

"Addressing the Consequences of School Closure Due to COVID-19 on Children's Physical and Mental Well-Being","Prolonged school closures are one of the most disruptive forces in the COVID-19 era. School closures have upended life for children and families, and educators have been forced to determine how to provide distance learning. Schools are also an essential source of nonacademic supports in the way of health and mental health services, food assistance, obesity prevention, and intervention in cases of homelessness and maltreatment. This article focuses on the physical and emotional toll resulting from school closures and the withdrawal of nonacademic supports that students rely on. The COVID-19 pandemic is shining a spotlight on how important schools are for meeting children's nonacademic needs. We argue that when students return to school there will be a more acute and wider-spread need for school-based nonacademic services and supports. Further, we expect that COVID-19 will serve as a focusing event opening a window of opportunity for programmatic and policy change that improves nonacademic services and supports in the future.","Hoffman, Jessica A.; Miller, Edward A.","https://doi.org/10.1002/wmh3.365",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: (World Med.

"[Effects on the integrated treatment of colorectal cancer patients during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a cross-sectional study]","Objective: To understand the treatment status and effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide evidence for decision-making for health-care workers. Methods: The method of cross-sectional study was applied. A questionnaire survey of CRC patients in China was carried out. Their basic and treatment information during the COVID-19 were collected and associated effects on treatment, nursing, state of psychology and needs of social support were analyzed. Results: Of the 1147 participants in the study, 635 (55.4%) were male and 512 (44.6%) were female with mean age of (52.8±12.8) years. The treatment or follow up of 896 (78.1%) CRC patients were affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 253 patients (22.1%) had their treatment regiments changed, of whom 141 (12.3%) had their chemotherapy regiments postponed or changed, and 83 patients (7.2%) had their surgical treatment affected. Among the above 83 patients, 39 patients (3.4%) underwent emergency surgery. A total of 277 patients (24.1%) had their out-of-hospital care needs affected, mainly due to maintenance of PICC (49.5%, 137/277). CRC patients had poorer sleep quality and increased levels of insomnia than before (P<0.001), and were more distressed, anxious, depressed, and angry than they were before. They presented the more requirements of help (P<0.001). In addition, 376 patients (32.8%) had received telemedicine services, but only 36.4% (137/376) of them were satisfied. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has effect on the integrated treatment of CRC patients include diagnosis, treatment, examination and prognosis. While protecting CRC patients from being infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care workers should also actively help them to receive timely and correct treatment and pay attention to their nursing, nutritional, psychological and social support needs in the COVID-19 epidemic.","Yang, Y; Gao, Z Y; Chen, Y K; Wang, H Y; Chen, J J; Song, C; Gu, J","https://dx.doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200416-00219",NA,"Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi;23(8): 795-800, 2020 Aug 25.; Publication details: Zhonghua Wei Chang Wai Ke Za Zhi;23(8): 795-800, 2020 Aug 25.; Colorectal Neoplasms; Coronavirus Infections; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The impacts of a COVID-19 epidemic focus and general belief in a just world on individual emotions","Whether the general belief in a just world (GBJW) can protect individual emotions during a major disaster is a matter of debate. This study conducted two experiments to explore this question during the COVID-19 epidemic. Experiment 1 (Nâ<U+0080>¯=â<U+0080>¯92, M ageâ<U+0080>¯=â<U+0080>¯22.52, 48.91% was male) manipulated the focus regarding the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate the impact of this focus on participants' emotions. The results showed that compared with the nonepidemic focus group, the epidemic focus group had higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions. Experiment 2 (Nâ<U+0080>¯=â<U+0080>¯200, M ageâ<U+0080>¯=â<U+0080>¯23.91, 49% was male) manipulated the epidemic focus and GBJW to investigate their effects on the participants' emotions. The results showed that high levels of GBJW reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions regardless of whether the participants were focused on the epidemic. This study expands the influence of the GBJW on individual emotions and finds that the GBJW can protect individuals' emotions when they face a major social disaster. These findings imply that controlling people's intake of information on the epidemic can avoid their suffering from the vicarious traumatization caused by epidemic-related information overload and that improving the public's GBJW protects their mental health during an epidemic.","Wang, Jin; Wang, Zhuo; Liu, Xiaojin; Yang, Xiaofan; Zheng, Meilin; Bai, Xuejun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110349",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pers Individ Dif;: 110349, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: Pers Individ Dif;: 110349, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement.Method: We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n = 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n = 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations.Results: The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7 %) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m = 30.9 (10.0)) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m = 15.0 (5.0)). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement.Conclusions: Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.","Salamin, Virginie; Rossier, Vanessa; Joye, Daisy; Nolde, Chrystelle; Pierrehumbert, Timothée; Gothuey, Isabelle; Guenot, Florence","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006",NA,"Country: FR; FRANÇA; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: Ann Med Psychol (Paris);2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

One hundred and thirty persons (101 women and 25 men; 4 did not report their gender)participated in the baseline measurement of trait emotional intelligence, positive and negative affect, and affect intensity and in a one-week daily diary. Trait emotional intelligence correlated positively with baseline positive affect and positive intensity, while negatively with baseline negative affect and negative intensity. Trait emotional intelligence marginally significantly predicted a lower frequency of anger, disgust, and sadness during the first week of the pandemic. Trait emotional intelligence predicted a lower intensity of fear, anxiety and sadness. The study showed a complex dynamics of emotional experiences during the first week of the COVID-19 pandemic. Positive states of relaxation and happiness were experienced more frequently and more intensely compared to the negatively-valenced emotions.

In a nationwide online sample of 435 U.S. adults, conducted in March 2020 as the pandemic accelerated and states implemented stay-at-home orders, we examined whether stay-at-home orders and individuals' personal distancing behavior were associated with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), intrusive thoughts, insomnia, and acute stress. Stay-at-home order status and personal distancing were independently associated with higher symptoms, beyond protective effects of available social resources (social support and social network size). A subsample of 118 participants who had completed symptom measures earlier in the outbreak (February 2020) showed increases in depression and GAD between February and March, and personal distancing behavior was associated with these increases.

"First report of manic-like symptoms in a COVID-19 patient with no previous history of a psychiatric disorder","BACKGROUND: In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection was first reported in Wuhan city, central China, which has spread rapidly. The common clinical features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection included fever, fatigue, and damage to the respiratory or digestive system. However, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause damage to the central nervous system (CNS) inducing psychiatric symptoms. CASE REPORT: Herein, we present the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with manic-like symptoms and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the case, focusing on the identifications of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient developed manic-like symptoms when his vital signs recovered on illness day 17. After manic-like attack, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in CSF was positive, while the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on CSF for the SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient received Olanzapine for treatment and his mood problems concurrently improved as indicated by scores of Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS). LIMITATION: This is a single case report only, and the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was not performed simultaneously when SARS-CoV-2 was positive in samples of sputum and stool. CONCLUSION: This first case of COVID-19 patient with manic-like symptoms highlights the importance of evaluation of mental health status and may contribute to our understanding of potential risk of CNS impairments by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lu, Shaojia; Wei, Ning; Jiang, Jiajun; Wu, Lingling; Sheng, Jifang; Zhou, Jianying; Fang, Qiang; Chen, Yu; Zheng, Shufa; Chen, Feng; Liang, Tingbo; Hu, Shaohua","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.031",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;277: 337-340, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;277: 337-340, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychedelic Science in Post-Covid Psychiatry","The medium to long term consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known, though an increase in mental health problems are predicted. Multidisciplinary strategies across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly progressing field of psychedelic science, shows that psilocybin assisted psychotherapy (PAP), offers a promising trans-diagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The COMPASS pathways, phase 2b double blind trial of PAP in antidepressant-free, treatment resistant depression (TRD) is underway across 19 research sites, to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of action of PAP to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of PAP in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. A new COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will answer this question, with implications for the future delivery of PAP. While at an early stage of clinical development, and notwithstanding the immense challenges of COVID-19, PAP is likely to play an important therapeutic role for certain disorders in post COVID-19 clinical psychiatry.","Kelly, John R; Crockett, Matthew T; Alexander, Lauren; Haran, Maeve; Baker, Annie; Burke, Lisa; Brennan, Christine; O'Keane, Veronica","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.94",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-18, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication details: Ir J Psychol Med;: 1-18, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Telehealth Beyond COVID-19","Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health care services have been shifted from face-to-face to virtual interactions. Several health policy changes have influenced telehealth uptake during this time, including changes in technology, Internet connectivity, prescriptions, and reimbursement for services. These changes have been implemented for the duration of the pandemic, and it is unclear if all, some, or none of these new or amended policies will be retained after the pandemic has ended. Accordingly, in the wake of changing policies, mental health care providers will need to make decisions about the future of their telehealth programs. This article briefly reviews telehealth policy changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights what providers should consider for future delivery and implementation of their telehealth programs.","Haque, Saira Naim","https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000368",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Serv;: appips202000368, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication details: Psychiatr Serv;: appips202000368, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Is the psychological impact of exposure to COVID-19 stronger in adolescents with pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences? A survey of rural Chinese adolescents","BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people's physical health. OBJECTIVE: The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. METHODS: Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. RESULTS: The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16â<U+0088>¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32â<U+0088>¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. CONCLUSIONS: After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Jing; Fu, Mingqi; Liu, Danxia; Zhang, Bo; Wang, Xiaohua; van IJzendoorn, Marinus H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104667",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104667, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104667, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Debate: Recognising and responding to the mental health needs of young people in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is a 'perfect storm' for the mental health of young people, because of exposure to known risk factors for psychopathology and lack of support from the infrastructures that are normally in place to ensure safety and provide support. However, it is yet unclear if this 'perfect storm' will flood the Child & Adolescent Mental Health Services. The early, normative emotional responses observed may not lead to enduring psychopathology in most young people. Nevertheless, a minority of young people may show complex presentations, particularly in relation to bereavement. As epidemiology and clinical practice will reveal the actual needs of young people, the hope is that we will find the focus and determination to build new solutions to promote young people's mental health.","Danese, Andrea; Smith, Patrick","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/camh.12414",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;25(3): 169-170, 2020 09.; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;25(3): 169-170, 2020 09.; Adolescent Health; Child Health; Coronavirus Infections; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Child; Humans; Mental Health Services; Risk Factors; Social Isolation; Uncertainty; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis","OBJECTIVE: Individuals with pre-existing chronic illness have shown increased anxiety and depression due to COVID-19. Here, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional symptomatology and quality of life in individuals with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PMS). METHODS: Data were obtained during a randomized clinical trial on rehabilitation taking place at 11 centers in North America and Europe. Participants included 131 individuals with PMS. Study procedures were interrupted in accordance with governmental restrictions as COVID-19 spread. During study closure, a COVID Impact Survey was administered via telephone or email to all participants, along with measures of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and MS symptomatology that were previously administered pre-pandemic. RESULTS: 4% of respondents reported COVID-19 infection. No significant changes were noted in anxiety, quality of life, or the impact of MS symptomatology on daily life from baseline to lockdown. While total HADS-depression scores increased significantly at follow-up, this did not translate into more participants scoring above the HADS threshold for clinically significant depression. No significant relationships were noted between disease duration, processing speed ability or EDSS, and changes in symptoms of depression or anxiety. Most participants reported the impact of the virus on their psychological well-being, with a little impact on financial well-being. The perceived impact of the pandemic on physical and psychological well-being was correlated with the impact of MS symptomatology on daily life, as well as changes in depression. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, little change was noted in symptoms of depression or anxiety or overall quality of life.","Chiaravalloti, Nancy D; Amato, Maria Pia; Brichetto, Giampaolo; Chataway, Jeremy; Dalgas, Ulrik; DeLuca, John; Meza, Cecilia; Moore, Nancy B; Feys, Peter; Filippi, Massimo; Freeman, Jennifer; Inglese, Matilde; Motl, Rob; Rocca, Maria Assunta; Sandroff, Brian M; Salter, Amber; Cutter, Gary; Feinstein, Anthony","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-10160-7",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Neurol;2020 Aug 19.; Publication details: J Neurol;2020 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Stress and parenting during the global COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. METHOD: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 risk factors, mental health risk factors, protective factors, parental perceived stress, and child abuse potential. RESULTS: Greater COVID-19 related stressors and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher parental perceived stress. Receipt of financial assistance and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic are associated with lower perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related stressors, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.","Brown, Samantha M; Doom, Jenalee R; Lechuga-Peña, Stephanie; Watamura, Sarah Enos; Koppels, Tiffany","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104699",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104699, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104699, 2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

METHODS: A total of 74 ED patients in treatment before the COVID-19 outbreak, contributed to this study. Baseline pre-treatment evaluation included the SCL-90R, TCI-R, EDI-2 and Y-FAS 2.0 questionnaires for general psychopathology, personality and ED severity indexes. ED symptoms, coping strategies, socio-demographic data and COVID-19 concerns were collected by clinicians through a semi-structured telephone survey during lockdown. RESULTS: A deterioration in ED symptoms and general psychopathology (anxiety and depression), during lockdown, was associated with low self-directedness. Higher ED symptomatology during confinement was associated with less-adaptive coping strategies to deal with lockdown situation leading to an increase in weight. CONCLUSIONS: These specific vulnerability factors to further confinement or stressful situations may help design personalized preventive and therapeutic approaches.","Baenas, Isabel; Caravaca-Sanz, Elena; Granero, Roser; Sánchez, Isabel; Riesco, Nadine; Testa, Giulia; Vintró-Alcaraz, Cristina; Treasure, Janet; Jiménez-Murcia, Susana; Fernández-Aranda, Fernando","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/erv.2771",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Eat Disord Rev;2020 Aug 20.; Publication details: Eur Eat Disord Rev;2020 Aug 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

We used descriptive data, binary logistic regression, and hierarchical linear modeling to investigate changes in number of sessions and clients, use of online mental health platforms, and changes in clients’ psychological functioning. Overall, we found that CAPS had a decrease in scheduled appointments (including intake) and no change in attendance rates. We estimate that premature termination impacted about 32–34% of individual therapy clients and 29–37% of group clients. The number of new users for our online therapeutic platforms did not appear to be affected. Clients in 2020 were not significantly more distressed than clients in the previous 3 years and we found no significant differences in outcome between 2020 and previous years, indicating that levels of distress and treatment trajectories remained similar across years.

She asks, particularly, how psychological therapies are positioned during such a crisis, and whether the pressures of triage and emergency can leave time and space for sustained emotional and psychological care. She wonders how psychoanalytic time with its sustaining rhythm can be held onto in the face of the need for triage on the one hand and the flight to online and telephone delivery on the other. Above all, the author questions how the apparent suspension of time during lockdown is belied by the onward pressure of adolescent time, and how this can be understood by, and alongside, troubled adolescents.","Catty, Jocelyn","https://dx.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15961.1",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Wellcome Open Res;5: 132, 2020.; Publication details: Wellcome Open Res;5: 132, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Lockdown: Housing Built Environment's Effects on Mental Health","Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on 11 March, severe lockdown measures have been adopted by the Italian Government. For over two months of stay-at-home orders, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized. As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures have had on mental health and well-being. We conducted a large web-based survey on 8177 students from a university institute in Milan, Northern Italy, one of the regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe. As emerged from our analysis, poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown. In particular, living in apartments <60 m2 with poor views and scarce indoor quality is associated with, respectively, 1.31 (95% CI: 1046-1637), 1.368 (95% CI: 1166-1605), and 2.253 (95% CI: 1918-2647) times the risk of moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms. Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 3713-4924). Housing design strategies should focus on larger and more livable living spaces facing green areas. We argue that a strengthened multi-interdisciplinary approach, involving urban planning, public mental health, environmental health, epidemiology, and sociology, is needed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mental health, so as to inform welfare and housing policies centered on population well-being.","Amerio, Andrea; Brambilla, Andrea; Morganti, Alessandro; Aguglia, Andrea; Bianchi, Davide; Santi, Francesca; Costantini, Luigi; Odone, Anna; Costanza, Alessandra; Signorelli, Carlo; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Capolongo, Stefano","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165973",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(16)2020 08 17.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(16)2020 08 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Effects of COVID-19 on College Students Mental Health in the US: An Interview-survey Study","BACKGROUND: Student mental health in higher education has been a rising concern. The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. METHODS: We conducted interview-surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States, to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and wellbeing. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety and depressive thoughts among students. These include fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty of concentrating (89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address mental health of college students.","Son, Changwon; Hegde, Sudeep; Smith, Alec; Wang, Xiaomei; Sasangohar, Farzan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21279",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Aug 15.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Aug 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Migrant workers in China need emergency psychological interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been found in more than 200 countries worldwide since December, 2019. In China, a major reason for the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 in early stage of the outbreak is the huge numbers of passengers boarding their ""last train home"" to meet family members during the Spring Festival. Most of these travelers were internal migrant workers. In order to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 transmission, public transportation networks were suspended, and many migrant workers who returned to their hometowns needed to be quarantined for 2 weeks, which led to the delay of returning back to cities to work. Many businesses have temporarily closed because of the risk of COVID-19 transmission, leading to unemployment of many workers.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Public Mental Health and the Buffering Effect of a Sense of Coherence","INTRODUCTION: It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. METHODS: This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. RESULTS: Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. CONCLUSIONS: Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","Schäfer, Sarah K; Sopp, M Roxanne; Schanz, Christian G; Staginnus, Marlene; Göritz, Anja S; Michael, Tanja","https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000510752",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom;: 1-7, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom;: 1-7, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"E-mental health mindfulness-based and skills-based 'CoPE It' intervention to reduce psychological distress in times of COVID-19: study protocol for a bicentre longitudinal study","INTRODUCTION: The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic poses immense challenges for national and international healthcare systems. Especially in times of social isolation and governmental restrictions, mental health should not be neglected. Innovative approaches are required to support psychologically burdened people. The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' has been developed to offer manualised and evidence-based psychotherapeutic support adapted to COVID-19-related issues in order to overcome psychological distress. In our study, we aim to assess the efficacy of the e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms as well as improving self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, we want to evaluate the programme's usability, feasibility and participants' satisfaction with 'CoPE It' (tertiary outcome). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' consists of four 30 min modules, conducted every other day, involving psychotherapeutic techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The widely applied and previously established content has been adapted to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by experts in psychosomatic medicine and stress prevention. In our longitudinal study, adult participants-with adequate German language and computer skills, and who have provided informed consent-will be recruited via emergency support hotlines in Germany. Flyers will be distributed, and online channels will be used. Participants will complete a baseline assessment (T0), a postintervention assessment (T1) and assessments 1 and 3 months later (T2 and T3, respectively). We will perform repeated measures analysis of covariance, mixed linear models, standard analyses of variance and regression, and correlation coefficients. In case of binary outcome variables, either mixed logistic regression or &#967;² tests will be used. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committees of the University of Duisburg-Essen (20-9243-BO) and University of Tübingen (469/2020BO) approved the study. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and conference presentations.

"Personal Protective Equipment and Mental Health Symptoms Among Nurses During the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between access to adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) and mental health outcomes among a sample of U.S. nurses. METHODS: An online questionnaire was administered in May 2020 to Michigan nurses via three statewide nursing organizations (nâ<U+0080><U+008A>=â<U+0080><U+008A>695 respondents). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with mental health symptoms. RESULTS: Nurses lacking access to adequate PPE (24.9%, nâ<U+0080><U+008A>=â<U+0080><U+008A>163) were more likely to report symptoms of depression (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.31, 2.94; pâ<U+0080><U+008A>=â<U+0080><U+008A>.001), anxiety (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12, 2.40; pâ<U+0080><U+008A>=â<U+0080><U+008A>.01) and post-traumatic stress disorder (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.22, 2.74; pâ<U+0080><U+008A>=â<U+0080><U+008A>.003).

"COVID-19 in Portugal: exploring the immediate psychological impact on the general population","Like previous pandemics, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has direct and indirect effects, including in mental health. To evaluate the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19, we conducted an online survey in Portugal (24-27 March 2020), using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). From the 10,529 participants (M = 31.33; SD = 9.73), 83.4% were women, had a mean age of 31.2 years, and 70.9% were active workers. Depression, anxiety, and stress were rated as moderate to severe in 11.7%, 16.9%, and 5.6% of the sample, respectively. Moreover, 49.2% of participants reported a moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak. Women, the unemployed, those with lower education, living in rural areas, and with flu-like symptoms or chronic disorders were risk factors. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable groups to better inform and adapt mental health policies and interventions.","Paulino, Mauro; Dumas-Diniz, Rodrigo; Brissos, Sofia; Brites, Rute; Alho, Laura; Simões, Mário R; Silva, Carlos F","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1808236",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Health Med;: 1-12, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: Psychol Health Med;: 1-12, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Interpersonal violence against people with disabilities: Additional concerns and considerations in the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective/Purpose: The objective of this article is to provide information about the ways in which the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may affect the ongoing public health issue of violence against people with disabilities and how rehabilitation psychologists and other providers can address these concerns in their practice. METHOD: This article reviews the literature on violence against people with disabilities as well as emerging literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and medical consequences. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic magnifies existing issues and barriers facing people with disabilities who are experiencing interpersonal violence. These issues include reliance on the perpetrator for care and assistance, barriers to reporting abuse and seeking help, fear of retaliation and other negative consequences if abuse is reported, emotional abuse related to disability, and exacerbation of secondary physical and mental health sequalae of abuse. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences enhance the already increased risk for abuse among people with disabilities. Providers who work with individuals with disabilities should address these issues at both the individual client and systems levels.

"Telemental health for child trauma treatment during and post-COVID-19: Limitations and considerations","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented disruptions and stress in the lives of children and families internationally. Heightened family stress and turmoil can increase risk for, and exacerbate, child maltreatment. As a result, child maltreatment experts are concerned that there will be an influx of children requiring trauma assessment and treatment during and after COVID-19. As physical distancing measures have been implemented and will likely persist into 2021, organizations providing trauma treatment to children and their families have had to rapidly pivot to telemental health to maintain service delivery with clients. While the benefits of telemental health have been identified, including reduced barriers to access, increased cost effectiveness, and broad availability of services, there are unique limitations to its implementation within a child maltreatment population, such as challenges with attention and emotion regulation skills, difficulties identifying dissociative symptoms, and increased time with perpetrators of abuse due to shelter in place orders. These limitations are exacerbated for children and families who are most marginalized and facing the highest levels of social and economic barriers. Lack of access to reliable technology, lack of a private or confidential space for sessions, and reluctance to process trauma in the absence of a safe environment, are all barriers to conducting effective trauma treatment over telemental health. This article discusses both the benefits and barriers to telemental health in a child maltreatment population and offers considerations for child trauma service provision, program development, and policy during and post the COVID-19 pandemic.","Racine, Nicole; Hartwick, Cailey; Collin-Vézina, Delphine; Madigan, Sheri","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104698",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104698, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication details: Child Abuse Negl;: 104698, 2020 Aug 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Attitudes and collateral psychological effects of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Colombia","OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical impact, psychological effects, and knowledge of pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak in seven cities in Colombia. Currently, there are uncertainty and concerns about the maternal and fetal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. METHODS: A cross-sectional web survey was carried out including pregnant women in seven cities in Colombia. Women were evaluated during the mitigation phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic between April 13 and May 18, 2020. The questions evaluated demographic, knowledge, psychological symptoms, and attitudes data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: A total of 1021 patients were invited to participate, obtaining 946 valid surveys for analysis. The rate of psychological consequences of the pandemic was much larger than the number of patients clinically affected by the virus, with 50.4% of the entire cohort reporting symptoms of anxiety, 49.1% insomnia, and 25% reporting depressive symptoms. Poorly informed women were more likely to be younger, affiliated to the subsidized regime, and with lower levels of education. CONCLUSION: The knowledge of pregnant women about SARS-CoV-2 infection is far from reality and this seems to be associated with an indirect effect on the concern and psychological stress of pregnant women in Colombia.","Parra-Saavedra, Miguel; Villa-Villa, Isis; Pérez-Olivo, José; Guzman-Polania, Leidy; Galvis-Centurion, Pablo; Cumplido-Romero, Álvaro; Santacruz-Vargas, Dario; Rivera-Moreno, Eliana; Molina-Giraldo, Saulo; Guillen-Burgos, Hernán; Navarro, Edgar; Flórez-Lozano, Karen; Barrero-Ortega, Amanda; Sanz-Cortes, Magdalena; Miranda, Jezid","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13348",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Gynaecol Obstet;2020 Aug 16.; Publication details: Int J Gynaecol Obstet;2020 Aug 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Stress in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic from a subjective perspective of a psychiatrist; Stres w dobie pandemii COVID-19 – subiektywna perspektywa psychiatry","The current epidemic is a difficult social situation requiring adaptation. New, chronic stressors likely to destabilise the functioning of an individual occur. Chronic stress has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of depression. Furthermore, it may destabilise the immune system, causing symptoms typical of inflammation – similar symptoms are observed in depressive patients. The COVID-19 pandemic is a powerful psychosocial stressor, and the restrictions imposed by governments of many countries further increase the level of social stress. It seems that the main pandemic-related stressors include fear of contracting the virus (including the family and friends) as well as anxiety about destabilised financial situation and socioeconomic uncertainty. Mood disorders, anxiety and sleeping problems, which are common symptoms of chronic stress, may not only be part of adaptive disorders, but also an inherent component of depressive or anxiety disorders. A number of studies confirming that stress during the epidemic significantly affects the functioning of many individuals, with sleeping disorders, generalised anxiety disorders and depression being the most common epidemic-related disorders, have emerged. It is therefore extremely important to identify individuals who belong to the group at highest risk of pathological symptoms induced by stress. The care for one’s own mental health, i.e. proper sleep hygiene, physical activity, diet and rest may play an important positive role in minimising the effects of stress on mental and somatic health of an individual.","Wierzbinski, Piotr","https://doi.org/10.15557/PiPK.2020.0013",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Psychiatr.

Results: Contact with nature, bird watching in particular, had many positive effects on the well-being of doctors during the epidemic. It met the basic needs, such as the need for security and a relationship with the good, permanent and accessible world of nature, which allowed for stabilization of mental well-being. It was found that the notions of freedom associated with birds allow for the mental experience of relativizing limitations and restrictions during isolation.

This study was conducted in Rasht, Iran, and included 150 college students aged between 18 and 32 years. In accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria for illness anxiety disorder and using 8 items of the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, which were adapted to coronavirus disease anxiety, the participants were randomly assigned into experimental group (n = 75) and waitlist control group (n = 75). The cognitive-behavioural intervention was provided for the experimental group participants in 10 90-minute sessions (5-day a week). The intervention was group-based and included the reduction of hypervigilance, amplification, and false safety-seeking behaviours. The Short Health Anxiety Inventory, Somatosensory Amplification Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory were completed by the participants before and after the intervention. Significant reductions were observed in health anxiety (p &lt; 0.01), somatosensory amplification (p &lt; 0.01), and depression (p &lt; 0.01) for the experimental group.

"Validation of the Impact of Event Scale With Modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19)","Viral outbreaks can be experienced as disruptive and can be associated with trauma-related stress symptoms. In the current study, we adjusted the Dutch version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to assess traumatic stress symptoms related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychometric properties of this Impact of Event Scale with modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19) were investigated by administering the IES-COVID19 to 380 university students who participated during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, upon invitation via e-mail. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-COVID19 was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, <U+03C7>2(85) = 147.51, CFI =.92, TLI =.90, RMSEA =.044, SRMR =.049. Cronbach’s alpha showed acceptable internal consistency of the total IES-COVID19, a =.75. Pearson’s correlations of the IES-COVID19 over time were also sufficient, demonstrating adequate test–retest reliability, r =.62. Significant correlations (ranging between.15 and.50) between the IES-COVID19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, stress-related rumination, as well as negative social interactions, demonstrate adequate convergent validity. Overall, the IES-COVID19 shows to be a valid and reliable measure that can be utilized to investigate trauma-related stress symptoms of intrusion and avoidance related to the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Vanaken, Lauranne; Scheveneels, Sara; Belmans, Eline; Hermans, Dirk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00738",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Front.

However, no study to date has examined such climatic extensions for the growth or otherwise of the novel coronavirus in Africa. Africa, with a mostly relatively warmer temperature differs from other regions of the world and in addition, has recorded far fewer cases compared to Asian, Europeans and the Americans (North and South). It then becomes imperative to examine the influence of meteorological indices in the growth or otherwise of coronavirus diseases in Africa to establish whether findings on the climatic conditions-COVID-19 growth are regionally specific. In this study, we examined the influence of meteorological factors for aiding or abating the spread of the aerosolised pathogen of COVID-19 in Africa. We rely on the generalised additive model (GAM) and found wind speed to positively relate to COVID-19 growth while mean temperature and relative humidity to inversely relates to COVID-19 growth curve in Africa. We accounted for potential cofounders in the core GAM model and discuss policy implications.Climatology; Environmental analysis; Environmental economics; Environmental health; Environmental impact assessment; Mean temperature; Average wind speed; Relative humidity; COVID-19; Climatic conditions; Africa.","Adekunle, Ibrahim Ayoade; Tella, Sheriffdeen Adewale; Oyesiku, Kayode O.; Oseni, Isiaq Olasunkanmi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04749",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Heliyon;8(6)20200801.; Publication details: Heliyon;8(6)20200801.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Developing and testing a nurse-led intervention to support bereavement in relatives in the intensive care (BRIC study): a protocol of a pre-post intervention study","BACKGROUND: When a patient is approaching death in the intensive care unit (ICU), patients' relatives must make a rapid transition from focusing on their beloved one's recovery to preparation for their unavoidable death. Bereaved relatives may develop complicated grief as a consequence of this burdensome situation; however, little is known about appropriate options in quality care supporting bereaved relatives and the prevalence and predictors of complicated grief in bereaved relatives of deceased ICU patients in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to develop and implement a multicomponent bereavement support intervention for relatives of deceased ICU patients and to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention on complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress in bereaved relatives. METHODS: The study will use a cross-sectional pre-post design in a 38-bed ICU in a university hospital in the Netherlands. Cohort 1 includes all reported first and second contact persons of patients who died in the ICU in 2018, which will serve as a pre-intervention baseline measurement. Based on existing policies, facilities and evidence-based practices, a nurse-led intervention will be developed and implemented during the study period. This intervention is expected to use 1) communication strategies, 2) materials to make a keepsake, and 3) a nurse-led follow-up service. Cohort 2, including all bereaved relatives in the ICU from October 2019 until March 2020, will serve as a post-intervention follow-up measurement. Both cohorts will be performed in study samples of 200 relatives per group, all participants will be invited to complete questionnaires measuring complicated grief, anxiety, depression and posttraumatic stress. Differences between the baseline and follow-up measurements will be calculated and adjusted using regression analyses. Exploratory subgroup analyses (e.g., gender, ethnicity, risk profiles, relationship with patient, length of stay) and exploratory dose response analyses will be conducted. DISCUSSION: The newly developed intervention has the potential to improve the bereavement process of the relatives of deceased ICU patients. Therefore, symptoms of grief and mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, might decrease.

"Síntomas de ansiedad, depresión y conductas de autocuidado durante la pandemia de COVID-19 en la población general; Symptoms of anxiety, depression and self-care behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic can have important psychosocial consequences in the population. Objective: To determine the levels of anxiety, depression and self-care symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Method: Online survey distributed over three weeks using a non-probability sampling. The PHQ-9 Patient Health Questionnaire, the GAD-7 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Visual analog scale for self-care behaviors were used. Between-group (anxiety and depression) descriptive and comparison analyses were carried out. Results: Out of 1508 included participants, 20.8% had symptoms of severe anxiety, while 27.5% showed symptoms of severe depression. Being a woman, being single, having no children, having medical comorbidities and a history of mental health care were risk factors for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression; 66 to 80 % of the population complied with self-care recommendations. A need for receiving mental health care was identified in our study population. Conclusion: A larger number of individuals with moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms were observed than in other pandemics. COVID-19 pandemic psychological effects are considered an emerging public health problem, and implementation of programs for their care is therefore recommended.","Galindo-Vázquez, Oscar; Ramírez-Orozco, Mónica; Costas-Muñiz, Rosario; Mendoza-Contreras, Luis A; Calderillo-Ruíz, Germán; Meneses-García, Abelardo","https://dx.doi.org/10.24875/GMM.20000266",NA,"Country: MX; MÉXICO; MEXICO; MEXICO; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gac Med Mex;156(4): 298-305, 2020.; Publication details: Gac Med Mex;156(4): 298-305, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya: a review","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted considerable impact on public mental health globally. With the pandemic rapidly rising in sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya, there is need to provide evidence to guide the mental health response in the region. Objectives: The objective of this review is (1) to describe the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, guided by the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework (2) to offer context specific recommendations for improvement of the mental health response in Kenya. Such information could be useful in decision-making in Kenya as well as in the greater sub-Saharan Africa region. Methods: This narrative review is based on information obtained from official government documents released from 13th March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic in Kenya, up to 31st July 2020. Discussion: The COVID-19 response in Kenya has no formal mental health response plan. There is an unmet need for psychological first aid in the community. While guidelines for the management of mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been prepared, implementation remains a major challenge due to a poorly resourced mental health system. There is no mental health surveillance system in place limiting ability to design evidence-based interventions. Conclusion: We propose four key strategies for strengthening the mental health response in order to mitigate the harmful impact of COVID-19 on public mental health in Kenya: (1) preparation of a formal mental health response plan specific to the COVID-19 pandemic with allocation of funding for the response (2) training of community health workers and community health volunteers on psychological first aid to enable access to support for those in need during the pandemic (3) scaling up of mobile health to increase access to care (4) conducting systematic and continuous text message surveys on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-making.","Jaguga, Florence; Kwobah, Edith","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00400-8",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Syst;14: 68, 2020.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Syst;14: 68, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Nurses' experiences regarding shift patterns in isolation wards during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A qualitative study","AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To explore nurses' experiences regarding shift patterns while providing front-line care for COVID-19 patients in isolation wards of hospitals in Shanghai and Wuhan during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Our findings will help to optimize shift work scheduling, use the existing nursing workforce more efficiently, and improve nursing quality. BACKGROUND: Nurses are one of the main professionals fighting against COVID-19. Providing care for COVID-19 patients is challenging. In isolation wards, the workload has increased, and the workflow and shift patterns are completely different from the usual. More importantly, there is a shortage of nurses. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to arrange nurses' shifts correctly and use the existing workforce resources efficiently. DESIGN: A qualitative descriptive study of 14 nurses in Chinese hospitals was conducted. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were used based on the phenomenological research method; data was analyzed using Colaizzi's method of data analysis. This study aligns with the COREQ checklist. RESULTS: Four themes were extracted: assess the competency of nurses to assign nursing work scientifically and reasonably, reorganize nursing workflow to optimize shift patterns, communicate between managers and front-line nurses to humanize shift patterns, and nurses' various feelings and views on shift patterns. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to arrange shift patterns scientifically and allocate workforce rationally to optimize nursing workforce allocation, reduce nurses' workload, improve nursing quality, and promote physical and mental health among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study emphasized nurses' experiences on shift patterns in isolation wards, providing useful information to manage shift patterns. Nursing managers should arrange shifts scientifically, allocate nursing workforce rationally, formulate emergency plans, and establish emergency response rosters during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gao, Xiaoyue; Jiang, Lili; Hu, Yinqing; Li, Li; Hou, Lili","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15464",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Nurs;2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: J Clin Nurs;2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Patient Satisfaction with Use of Telemedicine in University Clinic of Psychiatry: Skopje, North Macedonia During COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: There is increasing interest in the use of telemedicine as a means of health care delivery especially in circumstances of pandemics. This is partly because technological advances have made the equipment less expensive and simpler to use and partly because increasing health care costs and patient expectations have increased the need to find alternative modes of health care delivery. Introduction: Telemedicine and telepsychiatry, in particular, are rapidly becoming important delivery approaches to providing clinical care and information to patients in cases wherein the medical resources and the patients are very hard to be brought together with respect to rules of behavior in case of epidemics. The reliance on technology to bridge the obstacles between the patients (consumers) and medical resources (providers) can create problems that impact service delivery and outcomes, but in cases such as this (COVID-19 pandemics), this is virtually the only tool for providing clinical care and information to patients. Materials and Methods: A client satisfaction survey was undertaken in a daily hospital (a part of University Clinic of Psychiatry in Skopje). The anonymous modified self-report questionnaire (short form patient satisfaction questionnaire [PSQ-18]) covering demographic, gender, and age variables was endorsed by 28 participants. The mean age of the subjects was 40.25 ± 22 years, with a small majority of men (18 participants) versus women (11 participants). Results: Overall satisfaction with psychiatric care was high (80.22%). None of the demographic or other variables correlated significantly with satisfaction. Discussion: We had to reduce rate and time length of our face-to-face contacts with patients as a result of pandemics but they were able to reach their doctors virtually at all times. Conclusions: Many mental health professionals are using widely available, commercial software downloaded from the internet to provide care directly to a patient's home.","Haxhihamza, Kadri; Arsova, Slavica; Bajraktarov, Stojan; Kalpak, Gjorgji; Stefanovski, Branislav; Novotni, Antoni; Milutinovic, Milos","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0256",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Telemed J E Health;2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Telemed J E Health;2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. OBJECTIVE: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. METHODS: A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. RESULTS: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of ""psychosis after chloroquine."" Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Brandon S; Rosenthal, Lisa J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological factors associated with substance use initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact. Given the on-going nature of the outbreak, the deleterious toll on mental health, including substance use, is unknown. Negative reinforcement models of substance use posit that elevations in stress from the COVID-19 pandemic will elicit a corresponding motivation to downregulate COVID-19-related stress reactivity via substance use for a subset of the population. The current study sought to evaluate: (1) if COVID-19-related worry and fear were associated with substance use coping motives; and (2) how levels of COVID-19-related worry and fear differ between pre-COVID-19 substance users, COVID-19 substance initiators, and abstainers. Participants were 160 adults recruited nationally between April-May 2020 for an online study. Results indicated that COVID-19-related worry was associated with substance use coping motives. Additionally, compared to abstainers, pre-COVID-19 substance users and COVID-19 substance initiators demonstrated the highest levels of worry and fear. Examination of differences suggested that the COVID-19 substance initiators had the highest COVID-19-related worry and fear for all substances except for opioids, with effect size estimates ranging from small to medium. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19-specific psychological factors appear to be involved in substance use behavior.","Rogers, Andrew H; Shepherd, Justin M; Garey, Lorra; Zvolensky, Michael J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113407",NA,"Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113407, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113407, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general Chinese population: Changes, predictors and psychosocial correlates","The current COVID-19 pandemic is not only a threat to physical health, but also brings a burden to mental health in the general Chinese population. However, the temporal change of mental health status due to pandemic-related stress in relation to protective and risk factors to hostility is less known. This study was implemented at two timepoints, i.e., during the peak and the remission of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3233 Chinese individuals participated in the first wave, and among them 1390 participants were followed in a second wave. The result showed that fear significantly decreased over time, while depression level significantly increased during the second wave compared to the first wave of the survey. Younger age, lower-income, increased level of perceived stress, and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of depression escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a higher initial stress response tended to show more hostility. Furthermore, the use of negative coping strategy plays a potential intermediating role in the stress-related increase in hostility, while social support acts as a buffer in hostility in the general population under high stress. As the whole world is facing the same pandemic, this research provides several implications for public mental health intervention.","Duan, Hongxia; Yan, Linlin; Ding, Xu; Gan, Yiqun; Kohn, Nils; Wu, Jianhui","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113396",NA,"Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113396, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113396, 2020 Aug 18.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Interferon and therapy","Interferons are a group of soluble glycoproteins produced and released from cells as a response to viral infections. They are named as such due to their ability to ‘interfere’ with the viral cell production.There are three forms of interferons-Type I, Type II and Type III. Type I interferons consist of IFN-a, IFN-ß, IFN-<U+03C9>, IFN-<U+043A>, IFN-e that are induced by cytokines and act/bind on the IFNAR receptor. Type II interferon consists only of IFN-<U+096A> and is mostly produced by NK cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and B cells. In addition to the antiviral property, they also have antiproliferative effects on tumours. Type III interferon has four types of IFN-<U+03BB> that act through an FNGR receptor. Interferon has wide activity as an antiviral, antiangiogenic, antiproliferative agent-effectively preventing cancers, chronic viral infections and threatening diseases. Interferon can be applied as systemic or topical based on the treatment to be rendered to the patient-although topical had slight to no side effects. Recently, IFN-ß-1b and IFN-a2b have been studied for their properties in the growing COVID-19 pandemic and have proved to be effective as they show faster relief than other drugs. Although it has various advantages, interferon therapy includes numerous side effects like anxiety, depression, alopecia; mainly causing neurotoxicity and haematotoxicity-neutropenia. Some of these side effects are short and manageable but others may be long and persist after treatment also. Further studies on interferons would be prospective and can treat a wide variety of human disorders.","Merlin, Arokia Rajkumar Shancy; Muralidharan, N.P.; Roy, Anitha","https://doi.org/10.31838/ijpr/2020.SP1.003",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Int.

"The quality of research on mental health related to the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review","Background and aims: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This study aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open scientific research practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method and results: Twenty-eight studies were identified through a systematic search. Most of them met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, the widespread use of convenience samples and the lack of a priori power analysis, coupled with low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies and availability of databases, raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Conclusions: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good scientific practice.","Nieto, Inés; Navas, Juan F.; Vázquez, Carmelo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100123",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health;(7)20200801.; Publication details: Brain, Behav., Immun. - Health;(7)20200801.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Delivering Prolonged Exposure Therapy via Videoconferencing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Overview of the Research and Special Considerations for Providers","Leveraging technology to provide evidence-based therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), such as prolonged exposure (PE), during the COVID-19 pandemic helps ensure continued access to first-line PTSD treatment. Clinical video teleconferencing (CVT) technology can be used to effectively deliver PE while reducing the risk of COVID-19 exposure during the pandemic for both providers and patients. However, provider knowledge, experience, and comfort level with delivering mental health care services, such as PE, via CVT is critical to ensure a smooth, safe, and effective transition to virtual care. Further, some of the limitations associated with the pandemic, including stay-at-home orders and physical distancing, require that providers become adept at applying principles of exposure therapy with more flexibility and creativity, such as when assigning in vivo exposures. The present paper provides the rationale and guidelines for implementing PE via CVT during COVID-19 and includes practical suggestions and clinical recommendations.","Wells, Stephanie Y.; Morland, Leslie A.; Wilhite, Emily R.; Grubbs, Kathleen M.; Rauch, Sheila A.M.; Acierno, Ron; McLean, Carmen P.","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22573",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Differences in Distress and Coping with the COVID-19 Stressor in Nurses and Physicians","BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, health workers have shown an incredible commitment to their patients, sometimes in apocalyptic conditions. We explored ways to deal with the coronavirus stressor and psychological outcomes among physicians and nurses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 124 healthcare workers in General Hospital Nasice (Croatia) were invited to participate in a study by performing within the period of March 26 to April 6 2020 questionnaire collected information on socio-demographic characteristics and living conditions that may be risk factors for covid-19 concern, Short form health survey-36, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC; consisting of 8 subscales: Confrontive Coping, Distancing, Self-Controlling, Seeking Social Support, Accepting Responsibility, Escape-Avoidance, Planful Problem Solving, Positive Reappraisal). RESULTS: 11% healthworkers reports moderate to very-severe depression, 17% moderate to extremely-severe anxiety and 10% for moderate to extremely-severe stress. 67% of medical staff are worried. No statistically significant differences in the scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were found between nurses and physicians, but differences were found on Escape-Avoidance and Positive Reappraisal subscales. Nurses use significantly more avoiding coping style and positive reappraisal than doctors.

"Attachment Theory and Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the psychological health of individuals and societies. A theoretical framework is required in order to understand this impact and strategies to mitigate it. In this paper, individual and community responses to COVID-19 are discussed from the point of view of attachment theory, a psychological theory which examines the formation and disruption of attachment bonds across the life-span from an evolutionary perspective. The contributions of this perspective to individual psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as to social responses such as interpersonal violence and stigmatization, are discussed in the light of findings from attachment research. Proposals for incorporating the knowledge derived from attachment theory into therapeutic strategies, as well as in developing community resilience in the face of COVID-19, are discussed based on the available evidence. It is hoped that this information will be of value to clinicians and researchers, as well as to those involved in planning health services and social policy.","Rajkumar, Ravi Philip","https://dx.doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.256",NA,"Country: HR; CROÁCIA; CROATIA; CROACIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Danub;32(2): 256-261, 2020.; Publication details: Psychiatr Danub;32(2): 256-261, 2020.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Object Attachment; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Psychological Theory; Stress, Psychological; Humans; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 Pandemia: Neuropsychiatric Comorbidity and Consequences","Infection with the new corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) was first registered in December 2019 in China, and then later spread rapidly to the rest of the world. On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) informed the public for the first time about causes of pneumonnia of unknown origin, in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), in people who were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal whole sale local market in Wuhan. Coronavrus disease, called COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019), after China quickly spread to most countries in the wold, and the WHO on March 11, 2020 declared a pandmic with this virus. SARS-CoV-2, has a high level of sequential similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the same receptors when it enters the human body (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/ACE2). COVID-19 is respiratry infection that is primarily transmitted via respiratry droplets. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection can be very moderate (infected can be even asymptomatic) to very severe, with severe respiratory symptoms (bilateral severe pneumonia), septic schock, and fatal outcome. Numeous unknows regarding the biological, epidemilogical adn clinical characteristics of COVID-19, still exist, and make it impossible to predict with certainty the further course of the current pandemic. COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory system, but SARS-CoV-2, in a number of patients also penetrates the CNS, and apparently could be responsible for fatal outcome in some cases. The entrry of the virus into the brain can lead to neurological and psychiatric manifestationss, which are not uncommon, including headache, paresthesia, myalgia, impaired consciousnessm, confusion or delirum and cerebrovascular diseases. SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals should be evaluated in a timely manner for neurological and psychiatic symptoms because tretament of infection-related neurological and psychiatric complications is an important factor in better prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.From the current point of view, it seems that in COVID-19 survivors, in the coming years and decades, the inflammatory systemic process and/or the inflammatory process of the brain could trigger long-term mechanisms that generally lead to an increase of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Psychosocial consequences as well as consequences for mental health are also significant, both for the general population and especially for health workers of all profiles. COVID-19 pandemia is associtaed with negative psychosocial consequences, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger and stress, sleep disorders, simpotms of posttrauamtic stres disorder, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization.","Sinanovic, Osman; Muftic, Mirsad; Sinanovic, Selma","https://dx.doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.236",NA,"Country: HR; CROÁCIA; CROATIA; CROACIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Danub;32(2): 236-244, 2020.; Publication details: Psychiatr Danub;32(2): 236-244, 2020.; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Animals; Coronavirus Infections/transmission; Coronavirus Infections/veterinary; Humans; Pandemics/veterinary; Pneumonia, Viral/transmission; Pneumonia, Viral/veterinary; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

METHODS: Twenty-five participants completed self-report measures assessing worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ), anxiety (Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3), and trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS) at T0 (pre-lockdown, 4 November 2019-17 February 2020) and T1 (at the end of lockdown, 26 April-30 April 2020). We compared assessments at the two time points in the whole sample and in high and low worriers (defined at T0 by scores on PSWQ respectively above and below 1.5 SD from mean of the Italian normative sample). OUTCOMES: High worriers showed at T1 a significant increase of anxiety sensitivity and fear of mental health in comparison to low worriers. Moreover, in the whole sample, at T1 trait mindfulness was inversely related to worry and fear of mental health. INTERPRETATION: A valuable approach to support individuals experiencing anxiety related to the COVID-19 outbreak could be represented by mindfulness-based interventions improving the ability to focus attention and awareness on the present moment.","Baiano, Chiara; Zappullo, Isa; Conson, Massimiliano","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165928",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(16)2020 08 15.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(16)2020 08 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 and Social Isolation: A Case for Why Home-Based Resistance Training Is Needed to Maintain Musculoskeletal and Psychosocial Health for Older Adults","The coronavirus disease outbreak in China has become the world's leading health headline and is causing major panic and public concerns. Public health guidelines in many countries are suggesting that people stay at home to avoid human-to-human transmission of the virus, which may lead to reduced physical activity and greater feelings of isolation. Such effects may be particularly problematic in older adults due to their reduced physical capacities and their potential for increased mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. A potential way to minimize many of these side effects of stay-at-home guidelines may be progressive home-based resistance training. A simple way to provide progressive overload in home-based resistance training may involve elastic resistance, which has been demonstrated to provide similar benefits to traditional resistance training equipment typically found in gymnasiums.

"Epilepsy in time of COVID-19 a survey-based study","OBJECTIVES: Collateral damage may occur in epilepsy management during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to establish the impact of this pandemic on epilepsy patients in terms of patient-reported seizure control and emerging symptoms. MATERIALS & METHODS: Cross-sectional study including consecutive patients assessed by telephone contact in an epilepsy clinic during the first month of confinement. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded and a 19-item questionnaire was systematically completed. Data regarding the impact of confinement, economic effects of the pandemic, and subjective perception of telemedicine were recorded. Additional clinical data were obtained in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited: mean age 48.2±19.8 years, 121 (47.5%) women. An increase in seizure frequency was reported by 25 (9.8%) patients. Sixty-eight (26.7%) patients reported confinement-related anxiety, 22 (8.6%) depression, 31 (12.2%) both, and 72 (28.2%) insomnia. Seventy-three (28.6%) patients reported a reduction in economic income. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor-related epilepsy etiology [OR=7.36 (95% CI 2.17-24.96)], drug-resistant epilepsy [OR=3.44 (95% CI 1.19-9.95)], insomnia [OR=3.25 (95% CI 1.18-8.96)], fear of epilepsy [OR=3.26 (95% CI 1.09-9.74)], and income reduction [OR=3.65 (95% CI 1.21-10.95)] were associated with a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine was considered satisfactory by 214 (83.9%) patients. Five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with no changes in seizure frequency.

"Pilot trial of a transdiagnostic computerized anxiety sensitivity intervention among VA primary care patients","People in need of mental health treatment do not access care at high rates or in a timely manner, inclusive of Veterans at Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA) medical centers. Barriers to care have been identified, and one potential solution is the use of technology-based interventions within primary care. This study evaluated the Cognitive Anxiety Sensitivity Treatment (CAST), a previously developed computerized treatment that has shown efficacy in community samples for mental health symptoms including: anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, and suicidal ideation. VA primary care patients with elevated anxiety sensitivity (N = 25) were recruited to participate in a mixed-method open pilot to examine acceptability, usability, and preliminary effectiveness in a VA primary care setting. Participants completed an initial visit, that included the intervention, and a one-month follow-up. Veterans found CAST to be generally acceptable, with strong usability ratings. Qualitative analyses identified areas of strength and areas for improvement for use with VA primary care Veterans. Repeated measures ANCOVAs revealed significant effects for symptoms of anxiety, depression, traumatic-stress, and suicidal ideation. CAST could potentially have a large public health impact if deployed across VA medical centers as a first-step intervention for a range of mental health presenting concerns.","Norr, Aaron M; Katz, Andrea C; Nguyen, Janelle L; Lehavot, Keren; Schmidt, Norman B; Reger, Greg M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113394",NA,"Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113394, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113394, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Three months of loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown","The majority of the U.S. population has been under stay-at-home restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 since March 2020. Over the first three months of restrictions, 3,121 U.S. adults completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Despite relaxation of lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders over that time, loneliness scores increased significantly, particularly from April to May 2020, and appear to have plateaued by June. Loneliness was correlated with depression and suicidal ideation at all time points and was most prevalent among individuals who reported that they were still under community restrictions to socially isolate due to the novel coronavirus. Loneliness remains elevated despite the reopening of many communities.","Killgore, William D S; Cloonan, Sara A; Taylor, Emily C; Miller, Michael A; Dailey, Natalie S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113392",NA,"Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113392, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113392, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Trends in suicidal ideation over the first three months of COVID-19 lockdowns","To reduce viral spread during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, most communities across the U.S. engaged in some form of stay-at-home restrictions or lockdowns that limited social interaction and movement outside the home. To determine the effect of these restrictions on suicidal ideation, a total of 3,120 individuals completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at one of three time points from April through June 2020. The percentage of respondents endorsing suicidal ideation was greater with each passing month for those under lockdown or shelter-in-place restrictions due to the novel coronavirus, but remained relatively stable and unchanged for those who reported no such restrictions. Public health policy and routine clinical care need to address the potential for increased suicidal thinking among those experiencing prolonged restrictions of normal social contact.","Killgore, William D S; Cloonan, Sara A; Taylor, Emily C; Allbright, Matthew C; Dailey, Natalie S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113390",NA,"Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113390, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Psychiatry Res;293: 113390, 2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

With the increasing number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Nigeria, the pandemic has led to massive public reactions. This data attempted to evaluate the knowledge, impacts, and government intervention during the pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a questionnaire shared via social media using a Snowball sampling technique. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analysis of variance (ANOVA). A total of 387 responses was received. Results show that a significant number of respondents had adequate knowledge about COVID-19 modes of transmission, symptoms, and preventive measures. Respondents maintain personal hygiene as 67% wash their hands with soap. The pandemic has caused worry (65%), anxiety (42%), panic (35%), and depression (16%) among respondents, even as government intervention is seen as inadequate by 70%.

"Past Epidemics, Natural Disasters, COVID19, and Mental Health: Learning from History as we Deal with the Present and Prepare for the Future","As cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to rise, psychological endurance is a challenge many people will face. For mental health, heightened stress responses to the pandemic, is likely to manifest in three ways: 1) development of a new episode of a disorder in those with a predisposition to a major psychiatric disorder or an acute exacerbation in those who already have such a disorder, 2) development of a trauma or stressor related disorder, such as acute stress disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or adjustment disorders, and 3) development of a symptomatic stress response that does not meet the diagnostic criteria of a psychiatric disorder. The authors reviewed existing literature on past epidemics, natural disasters, and COVID-19 with a focus on psychiatry and mental health. Psychological effects of past epidemics (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-1, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Anthrax threat), past natural disasters, and current COVID-19 data suggest numerous psychological effects following the pandemic. Alcohol use, PTSD, anxiety, anger, fear of contagion, perceived risk, uncertainty, and distrust are a few of the immediate and long-term effects that are likely to result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying people in need of mental health care and determining the appropriate psychiatric services and therapy needed will be important. Increasing the use and availability of telehealth, group meetings, and online resources are some ways that health care workers can prepare for the increasing demand of psychiatric services during and following the pandemic.","Esterwood, Emily; Saeed, Sy Atezaz","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09808-4",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Q;2020 Aug 16.; Publication details: Psychiatr Q;2020 Aug 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How Do Arab Tweeters Perceive the COVID-19 Pandemic?","Language reflects several cognitive variables that are grounded in cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics and sociolinguistics. This paper examines how Arab populations reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter over twelve weeks since the outbreak. We conducted a lexicon-based thematic analysis using corpus tools, and LIWC and applied R language's stylo. The dominant themes that were closely related to coronavirus tweets included the outbreak of the pandemic, metaphysics responses, signs and symptoms in confirmed cases, and conspiracism. The psycholinguistic analysis also showed that tweeters maintained high levels of affective talk, which was loaded with negative emotions and sadness. Also, LIWC's psychological categories of religion and health dominated the Arabic tweets discussing the pandemic situation. In addition, the contaminated counties that captured most of the attention of Arabic tweeters were China, the USA, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan. At the same time, China and the USA were instrumental in evoking conspiracist ideation about spreading COVID-19 to the world.","Essam, Bacem A; Abdo, Muhammad S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10936-020-09715-6",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Psycholinguist Res;2020 Aug 14.; Publication details: J Psycholinguist Res;2020 Aug 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Public in Egypt","This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping among the public in Egypt during the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. An online snowball sampling approach was used to collect data from netizens in four Egyptian governorates between 16 and 30 April 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed to assess sociodemographic characteristics, sleeping hours per day, and psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety, and stress) of participants using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Out of 1629 participants, 48.1% were aged &#8804; 30 years, 42.4% were men, and 20.0% were working in the health sector. The participants reported a high prevalence of depression (67.1%: mild to moderate 44.6% and severe to very severe 22.5%), anxiety (53.5%: mild to moderate 30.6% and severe to very severe 22.9%), stress (48.8%: mild to moderate 33.8% and severe to very severe 15.0%), and inadequate sleeping (< 6 h/day) 23.1%. Female sex, working in sectors other than the health sector, watching/reading COVID-19 news &#8805; 2 h/day, and lack of emotional support from family and society were associated with a high prevalence of severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress.

"Early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care and on people with mental health conditions: framework synthesis of international experiences and responses","PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has many potential impacts on people with mental health conditions and on mental health care, including direct consequences of infection, effects of infection control measures and subsequent societal changes. We aimed to map early impacts of the pandemic on people with pre-existing mental health conditions and services they use, and to identify individual and service-level strategies adopted to manage these. METHODS: We searched for relevant material in the public domain published before 30 April 2020, including papers in scientific and professional journals, published first person accounts, media articles, and publications by governments, charities and professional associations. Search languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Relevant content was retrieved and summarised via a rapid qualitative framework synthesis approach. RESULTS: We found 872 eligible sources from 28 countries. Most documented observations and experiences rather than reporting research data. We found many reports of deteriorations in symptoms, and of impacts of loneliness and social isolation and of lack of access to services and resources, but sometimes also of resilience, effective self-management and peer support. Immediate service challenges related to controlling infection, especially in inpatient and residential settings, and establishing remote working, especially in the community. We summarise reports of swiftly implemented adaptations and innovations, but also of pressing ethical challenges and concerns for the future. CONCLUSION: Our analysis captures the range of stakeholder perspectives and experiences publicly reported in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. We identify potential foci for service planning and research.","Sheridan Rains, Luke; Johnson, Sonia; Barnett, Phoebe; Steare, Thomas; Needle, Justin J; Carr, Sarah; Lever Taylor, Billie; Bentivegna, Francesca; Edbrooke-Childs, Julian; Scott, Hannah Rachel; Rees, Jessica; Shah, Prisha; Lomani, Jo; Chipp, Beverley; Barber, Nick; Dedat, Zainab; Oram, Sian; Morant, Nicola; Simpson, Alan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01924-7",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol;2020 Aug 17.; Publication details: Soc Psychiatry Psychiatr Epidemiol;2020 Aug 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Facade of media and social media during covid-19: A review","A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) arose in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Soon it spread to other countries worldwide to become a pandemic. Globally, governments enforced quarantine and social distancing measures to prevent the spread of the infection. Mass media and social media platforms played a crucial role in providing information regarding the Coronavirus. Since little is known about COVID-19, various fake news, misinformation and rumours spread across the digital media that panicked people into making panic deci-sions. The rapid spread of misinformation and stories via social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube became a vital concern of the government and public health authorities. Medical misinformation and unver-ifiable content about the COVID-19 pandemic are spreading on social media at an unprecedented pace. Mitigating the advent of rumours and misinformation during the COVID-19 epidemic is crucial, since misinformation and fake news creates panic, fear and anxiety among people, predisposing them to various mental health conditions. Instead of considering social media as a secondary medium, it should be utilised to convey important information. Besides, it allows citizens to address their queries directly. Several governments across the world have taken actions to contain the pandemic of misinformation, yet measures are required to prevent such communication complications.","Srivastava, Kumar Chandan; Shrivastava, Deepti; Chhabra, Kumar Gaurav; Naqvi, Waqar; Sahu, Arti","https://doi.org/10.26452/ijrps.v11iSPL1.2288",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Int.

"Association Between Current Physical Activity and Current Perceived Anxiety and Mood in the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Confinement","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19, and several enacted measures such as compulsory confinement may have collateral consequences on both physical and mental health. We aimed to investigate associations between current physical activity (PA) and current perceived anxiety and mood among a sample of Spanish adults confined due to COVID-19 restrictions of movement. Using an online survey, we collected data on the Spanish adult population regarding health habits during the first days of enacted confinement. A total of 2250 participants (54.8% women) aged 35.3 (SD 13.6) completed the survey, which included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender, civil status, education, and occupation), health habits (i.e. prior PA, alcohol consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours) and COVID-19 confinement context (i.e. number of isolation days, solitude, and exposure to COVID-19). Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) short form was used to estimate weekly minutes of PA, whereas a single-item question was used to assess both current perceived anxiety and mood. We conducted weighted binomial logistic regressions to check associations between current adherence to WHO guidelines of PA and current perceived anxiety and mood of confined adults. Significant inverse associations between overall adherence to PA and current perceived anxiety in the final adjusted model (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54–0.79) as well as in several subgroup analyses such as younger women were observed. In addition, a borderline significant inverse association was found between current PA and current perceived worse mood when fully adjusted (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.00); this association was significantly stronger in women than men. The results of the present study indicate that current PA adherence to WHO guidelines in the initial phase of COVID-19 confinement associates with both lower current perceived anxiety and lower current perceived worse mood among a sample of Spanish adults.","López-Bueno, Rubén; Calatayud, Joaquín; Ezzatvar, Yasmin; Casajús, José A.; Smith, Lee; Andersen, Lars L.; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00729",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Front.

"Impact of covid-19 in India, a disastrous pandemic outbreak","Coronavirus disease in 2019, also called COVID-19, which has been widely spread worldwide had given rise to a pandemic situation. The public health emergency of international concern declares the agent as the (SARS-CoV-2) the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The COVID-19 pandemic has an unusual way of stroking the entire world. Crises have spread rapidly, disease load and casualties are still on the rise, and crisis influence is spreading across developing countries. Around the globe, the reactions, perceptions, and outcomes were distinct. The outbreak has reflected unfavourable mental health impacts and symptoms. This pandemic has also affected the healthcare department that is treating the patients suffering from diseases other than corona. The power and severity of slowdown varying from being temporary to a long-term recession, they are unanimous about the fact that the slowdown would have an intense impact amongst various sectors of the economy. Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has disfigured standard patterns of consumption and caused market inconsistency.

"Depression, anxiety and stress among the general population in the time of COVID-19 lockdown: A cross-sectional study protocol","The incidence of Depression, Anxiety and stress among the general population is steadily increasing due to outbreak of COVID-19 across the globe. Beyond the risks of COVID-19, concerns have been expressed to have mental effect on the general population due to COVID-19 lock down. The emotional impact is more among individuals with pre-existing medical diseases like hypertension, Coronary Artery Disease, Diabetes (DM) and psychiatric illness. The lockdown results in health anxiety, this can manifest as maladaptive behaviours (repeated medical consultations, avoiding health care even if genuinely ill, hoarding particular items); at a broader societal level, it can lead to mistrust of public authorities and scapegoating of particular populations or groups. There are very few data from India studying mental impact of lockdown due to COVID 19 among general population. In our study, we will assess DAS among rural population who are accompanying the Non-COVID 19 patients at a tertiary care rural hospital of central India in the era of lock down.","Gaidhane, Shilpa; Khatib, Nazli; Zahiruddin, Quazi Syed; Gaidhane, Abhay; Telrandhe, Shital; Godhiwal, Parth","https://doi.org/10.26452/ijrps.v11iSPL1.2726",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Int.

"What Happened to Patients With Obsessive Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Multicentre Report From Tertiary Clinics in Northern Italy","After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, this resulted in extraordinary public health measures to control the infection, such as entire countries being placed under quarantine. The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.","Benatti, Beatrice; Albert, Umberto; Maina, Giuseppe; Fiorillo, Andrea; Celebre, Laura; Girone, Nicolaja; Fineberg, Naomi; Bramante, Stefano; Rigardetto, Sylvia; Dell’Osso, Bernardo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00720",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Front.

"Effect of 2019 coronavirus pandemic on ophthalmologists practicing in Saudi Arabia: A psychological health assessment","PURPOSE: To assess the psychological impact and mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, and insomnia during COVID-19 crisis among ophthalmologists. METHODS: This was a simple random study in which ophthalmologists practicing in Saudi Arabia were asked to fill in a self-administered online survey during the period from March 28, 2020, to April 04, 2020. Four validated psychiatric assessment tools were used to detect symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress perception. RESULTS: One hundred and seven participants successfully completed the survey with a response rate of 30.6%. Males constituted 56.1% (n = 60). Ophthalmology residents constituted the majority (n = 66, 61.7%). About half of the physicians exhibited symptoms of depression (n = 56, 50.5%), anxiety (n = 50, 46.7%), and insomnia (n = 48, 44.9%). Symptoms of stress ranged between low (28%), moderate (68.2%), and high (3.7%). According to the cutoff values for severe symptoms, 29% were identified as having depression, 38.3% had anxiety, and 15% had insomnia.Depression was found to be more common among female ophthalmologists (P = 0.06), those living with an elderly (P = 0.003), and fellows (P = 0.006). Female ophthalmologists suffering from anxiety were significantly more than male ophthalmologists (P = 0.046). There was a trend toward suffering from anxiety in frontline health-care providers (P = 0.139) and in ophthalmologists who are living with an elderly (P = 0.149). Female participants exhibited significantly more moderate-to-high symptoms of stress (P = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists' psychological needs, females in particular, should be addressed appropriately during the COVID-19 pandemic. Establishing psychological support units, especially for high-risk individuals, should be considered to minimize psychological adverse effects.","Almater, Abdullah; Tobaigy, Mohannad; Younis, Afnan; Alaqeel, Meshal; Abouammoh, Marwan","https://doi.org/10.4103/meajo.MEAJO_220_20",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Middle East Afr.

"From containment to harm reduction from SARS-CoV-2: a fabric mask for enhanced effectiveness, comfort, and compliance","Although the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating, public health strategies have transitioned from containment to harm reduction. In light of this paradigm shift, it is critical that individuals take steps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the United States, the CDC recommends that individuals wear face coverings in public places, such as grocery stores. As lockdowns are being phased out around the world, authorities are requiring the use of such masks in public places while maintaining social distance. Individuals (including healthcare professionals outside of their clinical settings) and manufacturers are following the CDC’s recommendation. But, many currently available masks are not form-fitting, are not customizable, and are uncomfortable with even short-term use, thereby undercutting their effectiveness. Moreover, because cotton absorbs and retains the moisture found in an exhaled breath masks made of cotton have the potential to increase the wearer’s risk of infection. Thus, as we shift to harm reduction and social distancing measures relax, it is imperative that these shortcomings in fabric masks are addressed and that is the motivation for this research. The overall objective of the research is to design, develop, and test a fabric mask that is effective while being comfortable during continuous use over long periods of time. As the first step in the design process, we reviewed the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We analyzed a medical mask and a fabric mask in the market and identified their shortcomings. We carried out an in-depth analysis of user needs and developed the performance requirements of the proposed mask. We defined the architecture of the mask comprising the following principal components: Barrier, Form-Fitting, Positioning, and Fastening. We tested and evaluated candidate materials for the components and developed the design specifications and construction details for the mask. We produced the mask and carried out subjective testing on a user in a typical workplace setting; we demonstrated that the mask was form-fitting, customizable, washable, and could be worn continuously and routinely over extended periods of time by individuals and therefore could serve as an effective means to reduce the harm from SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Sungmee; Jayaraman, Sundaresan","https://doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.1805971",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Prolongation of QT interval due to hydroxychloroquine overdose used in COVID-19 treatment","Hydroxychloroquine is one of the most commonly used drugs in COVID-19 treatment. In this case report, we aimed to present a young patient whose QT interval was prolonged due to hydroxychloroquine overdose which was given for COVID-19 treatment. This is the first reported case of QT interval prolongation at a low dose of 1.600 mg in the literature. A 28-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with the complaints of nausea, diarrhea, and weakness. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 a day prior and home isolation was recommended with hydroxychloroquine and oseltamivir P. O. treatment. His complaints started 6 h after accidentally taking 1.600 mg of hydroxychloroquine P. O. at the same time. On physical examination, the Glasgow Coma Scale was 15, and neurological, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. His pulse was 54 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 99%, arterial blood pressure was 122/82 mmHg, and fever was 36.5°C. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and corrected QT interval was calculated as 510 ms. The QT interval prolongation and bradycardia persisted, and the patient was hospitalized for follow-up and treatment. He was discharged on the 3rd day of his hospitalization after the corrected QT interval was detected to be 420 ms and his bradycardia improved. Due to the potential cardiac side effects, patients who are sent to home isolation with treatment should be educated about the use, dosage, and possible side effects of this medicine, and serial ECG monitoring should be provided to patients who are hospitalized.","Aksel, Gökhan; Islam, Mehmet Muzaffer; Aslan, Tuncay; Eroglu, Serkan Emre","https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/2452-2473.290063",NA,"Country: IN; ÍNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Turk J Emerg Med;20(3): 149-151, 2020.; Publication details: Turk J Emerg Med;20(3): 149-151, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health toll from the coronavirus: Social media usage reveals Wuhan residents' depression and secondary trauma in the COVID-19 outbreak","This study investigates the possible association between social media usage and the mental health toll from the coronavirus at the peak of Wuhan's COVID-19 outbreak. Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan - the first epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic - used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues. The results imply that taking a social media break may promote well-being during the pandemic, which is crucial to mitigating mental health harm inflicted by the pandemic.","Zhong, Bu; Huang, Yakun; Liu, Qian","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Comput Human Behav;: 106524, 2020 Aug 15.; Publication details: Comput Human Behav;: 106524, 2020 Aug 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Risk factors for anxiety of otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province fighting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","PURPOSE: To ensure the mental health of the otolaryngology healthcare workers in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to know their mental status and to identify possible risk factors. In this study, we investigated the risk factors for the anxiety in the otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province under the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: The otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei Province were surveyed using an online questionnaire in which anxiety was measured against the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk factors of anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 449 otolaryngology healthcare workers participated in the study. Of all the participants, 131 (29.18%) had anxiety symptoms. Compared with doctors, nurses were at a higher risk for anxiety (OR = 2.162, 95% CI 1.311-3.566). Participants who often suspected self-infection (OR = 4.239, 95% CI 1.647-10.909) or family member infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (OR = 4.485, 95% CI 1.511-13.313) were more likely to develop anxiety than those who never. The subjects who had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19 were more vulnerable to anxiety (OR = 2.014, 95% CI 1.205-3.366). Respondents working in infectious isolation wards had a 3.522-fold increased risk of anxiety compared to those on leave (OR = 3.522, 95% CI 1.634-7.593). CONCLUSION: Some otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province experienced anxiety during the epidemic, but most of them did not receive treatment. The healthcare providers themselves should be informed about and aware of their own mental health, and should be given support as appropriate.

"The psychological impact on an orthopaedic outpatient setting in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the coronavirus claimed 4628 lives worldwide. Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. RESULTS: A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. ""Work adjustments"" (74.2%), ""changes in personal plans"" (72.6%), and finding it ""confining"" (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire. On the other hand, ""financial concerns"" garnered the least positive responses (21.0%). CONCLUSION: The protracted duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resultant prolonged adjustments can have unintended consequences of wearing down healthcare resources otherwise allocated to chronic and elective conditions. Countries should ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard the mental well-being of our healthcare workers to avoid needing another reactive strategy in this battle against COVID-19.","Wong, Khai Cheong; Han, Xinyun Audrey; Tay, Kae Sian; Koh, Suang Bee; Howe, Tet Sen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-01862-9",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Orthop Surg Res;15(1): 322, 2020 Aug 12.; Publication details: J Orthop Surg Res;15(1): 322, 2020 Aug 12.; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Health Personnel/psychology; Orthopedics/trends; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital/trends; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Adult; Aged; Coronavirus Infections/therapy; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel/trends; Humans; Male; Mental Health/trends; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases/psychology; Musculoskeletal Diseases/therapy; Occupational Exposure/prevention & control; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/therapy; Singapore/epidemiology; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Ultra-low-dose chest CT imaging of COVID-19 patients using a deep residual neural network","The current study aimed to design an ultra-low-dose CT examination protocol using a deep learning approach suitable for clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 patients. In this study, 800, 170, and 171 pairs of ultra-low-dose and full-dose CT images were used as input/output as training, test, and external validation set, respectively, to implement the full-dose prediction technique. A residual convolutional neural network was applied to generate full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images. The quality of predicted CT images was assessed using root mean square error (RMSE), structural similarity index (SSIM), and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Scores ranging from 1 to 5 were assigned reflecting subjective assessment of image quality and related COVID-19 features, including ground glass opacities (GGO), crazy paving (CP), consolidation (CS), nodular infiltrates (NI), bronchovascular thickening (BVT), and pleural effusion (PE). The radiation dose in terms of CT dose index (CTDI<sub>vol</sub>) was reduced by up to 89%. The RMSE decreased from 0.16 Â± 0.05 to 0.09 Â± 0.02 and from 0.16 Â± 0.06 to 0.08 Â± 0.02 for the predicted compared with ultra-low-dose CT images in the test and external validation set, respectively. The overall scoring assigned by radiologists showed an acceptance rate of 4.72 Â± 0.57 out of 5 for reference full-dose CT images, while ultra-low-dose CT images rated 2.78 Â± 0.9. The predicted CT images using the deep learning algorithm achieved a score of 4.42 Â± 0.8. The results demonstrated that the deep learning algorithm is capable of predicting standard full-dose CT images with acceptable quality for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 positive patients with substantial radiation dose reduction. â€¢ Ultra-low-dose CT imaging of COVID-19 patients would result in the loss of critical information about lesion types, which could potentially affect clinical diagnosis. â€¢ Deep learning-based prediction of full-dose from ultra-low-dose CT images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 could reduce the radiation dose by up to 89%. â€¢ Deep learning algorithms failed to recover the correct lesion structure/density for a number of patients considered outliers, and as such, further research and development is warranted to address these limitations.","Shiri, Akhavanallaf, Sanaat, Salimi, Askari, Mansouri, Shayesteh, Hasanian, Rezaei-Kalantari, Salahshour, Sandoughdaran, Abdollahi, Arabi, Zaidi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-020-07225-6","20200903","Artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Deep learning; Tomography X-ray computed","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health in the era of COVID-19: prevalence of psychiatric disorders in a cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes during the social distancing","In patients with diabetes, the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms is about two to four times greater than in the general population. The association between diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment, and psychological distress could increase depressive symptoms and cause adverse diabetes outcomes. To assess the prevalence of mental health disorders in patients with diabetes during the social distancing period due to COVID-19 pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study developed to assess the impact of social distancing on a cohort of adults with type 1 (nâ€‰=â€‰52) and type 2 diabetes (nâ€‰=â€‰68) in Brazil. Inclusion criteria involved having an HbA1c test collected in the past 3Â months and having a valid telephone number in electronic medical records. The primary outcome was the prevalence of minor psychiatric disorders, assessed by survey (SRQ-20). Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of diabetes related emotional distress, eating and sleeping disorders, all assessed by validated surveys at the moment of the study. Statistical analyses included unpaired <i>t</i>-test for continuous variables and <i>Ï‡</i><sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables.

"The COVID-19 pandemic: how to maintain a healthy immune system during the lockdown - a multidisciplinary approach with special focus on athletes","On January 31, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a novel coronavirus responsible for an infection termed COVID-19 as a global public health emergency. To slow the spread of the coronavirus, countries around the world have been implementing various measures, including school and institutional closures, lockdown and targeted quarantine for suspected infected individuals. More than a third of the world's population have been home confined less than 4 months after the start of the outbreak. The present article aims to advise healthy individuals and athletes who are in lockdown regarding their lifestyle in order to keep healthy, safe and fit. The advice contained in the present article could apply to anyone aiming at remaining in good physical and mental health while forced to undergo lockdown, quarantine, or limited movement (movement control order). Boosting the immune system is crucial during such periods for confined people and especially for confined athletes. Specific recommendations must be followed concerning boosting the immune system through physiological and psychological management. This article analyses the available scientific evidence in order to recommend a practical approach, focusing on nutrition, intermittent fasting or caloric restriction, vitamin D insufficiency, sleep pattern, exercise, and psychodynamic aspects as factors impacting the immune system and human health in general.","Yousfi, Bragazzi, Briki, Zmijewski, Chamari","https://doi.org/10.5114/biolsport.2020.95125","20200903","SARS-CoV-2; adequate sleep; mental disorders; physical distance; self-isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Medical students<b>'</b> mental health, professional pride, and intention to work in the front<b>-</b>line during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","To understand medical students' mental health, professional pride, and intention to work in the front-line during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and provide a reference for psychological intervention. We used the depression-anxiety-stress scale and self-designed questionnaire on professional pride, intention to work in the front-line and the extent of family support. Medical students from 4 medical schools in Fujian and Hunan were investigated. Their mental health status, professional pride and first-line work willingness with different characteristics were compared, and the influential factors for professional pride and first-line work willingness were analyzed. A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected. During the pandemic, there were significant differences in the proportion of depressed students among different college and universities, majors and stages (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05), and the professional pride was significantly different (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). Medical students with different mental health status showed significant differences in professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). Marriage, pressure and extent of family support were the influential factors for their professional pride (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). The latter two were also influential factors for their intention to work in the front-line (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the pandemic, students from college and nursing have relatively better mental health and higher professional pride. The professional pride is low in medical students who married, with abnormal stress or low family support. The intention to work in front-line is decreased in students with abnormal stress or low family support. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…å¤§æµè¡ŒæœŸé—´åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œä¸ºè¿›è¡Œå¿ƒç†å¹²é¢„æä¾›å‚è€ƒã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é‡‡ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨å’Œè‡ªè¡Œè®¾è®¡çš„å…³äºŽèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿã€ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿å’Œå®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦çš„è°ƒæŸ¥é—®å·ï¼Œé€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°å¯¹ç¦å»ºã€æ¹–å—4æ‰€åŒ»å­¦é™¢æ ¡çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿè¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œæ¯”è¾ƒä¸åŒç‰¹å¾çš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿçš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µã€èŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå’Œä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ï¼Œå¹¶åˆ†æžèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿä¸Žä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·266ä»½ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ä¸åŒé™¢æ ¡ã€ä¸“ä¸šã€é˜¶æ®µåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå‘ç”ŸæŠ‘éƒçš„æ¯”ä¾‹å’ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(åˆ†åˆ«<i>P</i>&lt;0.05ï¼Œ<i>P</i>&lt;0.001)ï¼Œä¸åŒå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿå·®å¼‚æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œå©šå§»ã€åŽ‹åŠ›ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿçš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ï¼ŒåŽä¸¤è€…ä¹Ÿæ˜¯åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿çš„å½±å“å› ç´ (<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å¤§ä¸“é™¢æ ¡ã€æŠ¤ç†ä¸“ä¸šåŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿå¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µè¾ƒå¥½ï¼ŒèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒé«˜ï¼Œå·²å©šã€åŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”ŸèŒä¸šè‡ªè±ªæ„Ÿè¾ƒä½Žï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¼‚å¸¸ã€å®¶äººæ”¯æŒç¨‹åº¦ä½Žçš„åŒ»å­¦ç”Ÿä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œæ„æ„¿ä¸‹é™ã€‚.","Zhan, Sun, Xie, Wen, Fu","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200440","20200903","coronavirus disease 2019; intention to work in front-line; medical students; mental health; professional pride","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological status of the staff in a general hospital during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 and its influential factors","To understand the psychological status of the staff in a general hospital during the coronavirus disease 2019 and its influential factors, and to provide references for the mental health services to hospital staff. Using star platform of questionnaire, the staff in the general hospital were investigated via Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). The influential factors were discussed by descriptive analysis, rank sum test, single factor analysis, correlation analysis and multiple factors binary logistic regression analysis. A total of 2 060 valid questionnaires were collected. The negative emotions of nurses and cleaners were the most obvious. The depression scores, anxiety scores and stress scores for nurses and cleaners were 5.06Â±7.47, 6.36Â±7.84, 9.75Â±8.65, and 6.72Â±8.84, 4.51Â±6.56, 9.69Â±9.56, respectively. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that staff types, education levels, job status, economic situation and concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for depression; staff types, contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods, history of disease were the main influential factors for anxiety; contacting status with infected patients, economic situation, concerns on the supplies of protective goods were the main influential factors for stress. There are differences in psychological characteristics among different groups of staff in the general hospital under the outbreak. Thus psychological protection and intervention measures should be formulated according to different groups and work status. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: äº†è§£2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥çš„å¿ƒç†çŽ°çŠ¶å¹¶åˆ†æžå…¶å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼Œä¸ºåŒ»é™¢å‘˜å·¥å¿ƒç†æœåŠ¡æä¾›å‚è€ƒä¾æ®ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é€šè¿‡é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°ï¼Œåº”ç”¨æŠ‘éƒ-ç„¦è™‘-åŽ‹åŠ›é‡è¡¨(Depressionï¼ŒAnxiety and Stress Scaleï¼ŒDASS-21)ã€ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒè¯„å®šé‡è¡¨(Social Support Rating Scaleï¼ŒSSRS)ã€ç®€æ˜“åº”å¯¹æ–¹å¼é‡è¡¨(Simplified Coping Style Questionnaireï¼ŒSCSQ)å¯¹æŸä¸‰çº§ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢çš„å‘˜å·¥è¿›è¡Œè°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œé‡‡ç”¨æè¿°æ€§åˆ†æžã€ç§©å’Œæ£€éªŒã€å•å› ç´ åˆ†æžã€ç›¸å…³æ€§åˆ†æžåŠå¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæŽ¢è®¨ç›¸å…³å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: å›žæ”¶æœ‰æ•ˆé—®å·2 060ä»½ã€‚æŠ¤å£«å’Œä¿æ´å‘˜è´Ÿæ€§æƒ…ç»ªæœ€æ˜Žæ˜¾ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­æŠ¤å£«æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†5.06Â±7.47ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†6.36Â±7.84ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.75Â±8.65ï¼›ä¿æ´å‘˜æŠ‘éƒå¾—åˆ†6.72Â±8.84ï¼Œç„¦è™‘å¾—åˆ†4.51Â±6.56ï¼ŒåŽ‹åŠ›å¾—åˆ†9.69Â±9.56ã€‚å¤šå› ç´ äºŒå…ƒlogisticå›žå½’åˆ†æžæ˜¾ç¤ºï¼šå²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€æ–‡åŒ–ç¨‹åº¦ã€èŒåŠ¡ã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯æŠ‘éƒçš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›å²—ä½ç±»åˆ«ã€ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽçš„å½±å“ã€é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦ã€ç–¾ç—…å²æ˜¯ç„¦è™‘çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ï¼›ä¸Žæ„ŸæŸ“è€…æŽ¥è§¦æƒ…å†µã€ç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»æµŽå½±å“ï¼Œå¯¹é˜²æŠ¤ç‰©è´¨ä¾›ç»™ä¸è¶³çš„æ‹…å¿ƒç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŽ‹åŠ›çš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ç»¼åˆåŒ»é™¢ä¸åŒäººç¾¤çš„å¿ƒç†ç‰¹å¾æœ‰å·®å¼‚ï¼Œéœ€æ ¹æ®ä¸åŒäººç¾¤åŠå…¶å·¥ä½œçŠ¶æ€åˆ¶è®¢ç›¸åº”çš„å¿ƒç†é˜²æŠ¤åŠå¹²é¢„æŽªæ–½ã€‚.","Jiang, Liu, Zhao, Xie, Wang, Ouyang, Guo, Gong, Zhou, Li","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200190","20200903","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; different groups of staff; influential factors; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health status of medical staff in the epidemic period of coronavirus disease 2019","To explore the psychological status of medical staff in the epidemic period of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to analyze its influential factors. A total of 373 medical staff from Xiangya Hospital and the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were enrolled for this study. The General Sociological Data Questionnaire, Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90), and self-designed public opinion response questionnaire were used to assess general sociological data, mental health scores, and ability to respond to COVID-19 related public opinion information of medical staff. The mental health scores of medical staff with different general sociological data and public opinion information coping abilities were compared. Influential factors of mental health were analyzed. The average score of 10 factors in SCL-90 of 373 medical staff was less than 2 points. 14.21% medical staff had one or more factor scores more than two points, including 11.26% with terror symptoms, 7.77% with compulsive symptoms, and 5.63% with anxiety. The main sources of COVID-19 information for medical staff included WeChat, microblog, Jinri toutiao, TV and radio. 66.22% medical staff regularly verified information about COVID-19 through official websites or formal channels. A great deal of COVID-19 information in WeChat could make medical staff nervous (34.05%), anxious (30.29%), and insecure (29.22%). 68.63% medical staff sometimes were worried about getting infected because they knew information about COVID-19. Different departments of medical staff, getting cough or having a fever recently, and the degree of fear of infection had an impact on the SCL-90 score of medical staff, the differences were all statistically significant (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). Stepwise regression analysis showed that the impact of COVID-19 information on their life in WeChat, getting cough or having a fever recently, insomnia-early caused by COVID-19 information in WeChat, different departments, and the degree of fear of infection COVID-19 were the influential factors for the mental health of medical staff (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.05). During the epidemic of COVID-19, medical staff suffered from psychological problems to various degrees. It is necessary to establish a psychological assistance platform and guide the direction of public opinion correctly to promote the mental health of medical staff. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: è¯„ä¼°åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜åœ¨2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´çš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µï¼Œå¹¶åˆ†æžå…¶å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: é€‰å–ä¸­å—å¤§å­¦æ¹˜é›…åŒ»é™¢å’Œæ¹˜é›…äºŒåŒ»é™¢373ååŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜ä½œä¸ºç ”ç©¶å¯¹è±¡ã€‚åˆ†åˆ«é‡‡ç”¨ä¸€èˆ¬ç¤¾ä¼šå­¦èµ„æ–™é‡è¡¨ã€ç—‡çŠ¶è‡ªè¯„é‡è¡¨(Symptom Check-List 90ï¼ŒSCL-90)åŠè‡ªåˆ¶èˆ†æƒ…åº”å¯¹é—®å·æ”¶é›†åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜ä¸€èˆ¬ç¤¾ä¼šå­¦èµ„æ–™ã€å¿ƒç†å¥åº·å¾—åˆ†æƒ…å†µå’Œåº”å¯¹COVID-19ç›¸å…³èˆ†æƒ…ä¿¡æ¯èƒ½åŠ›æƒ…å†µï¼›å¹¶è¿›ä¸€æ­¥æ¯”è¾ƒä¸åŒä¸€èˆ¬ç¤¾ä¼šå­¦ç‰¹å¾åŠèˆ†æƒ…ä¿¡æ¯åº”å¯¹èƒ½åŠ›çš„åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜å¿ƒç†å¥åº·å¾—åˆ†ï¼Œåˆ†æžåŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µçš„å½±å“å› ç´ ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: 373ååŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜SCL-90ä¸­10ä¸ªå› å­çš„å¹³å‡åˆ†å‡&lt;2ï¼Œ14.21%çš„åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜å­˜åœ¨1ä¸ªåŠä»¥ä¸Šçš„å› å­å¾—åˆ†â‰¥2ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­ææ€–(11.26%)ã€å¼ºè¿«ç—‡çŠ¶(7.77%)ã€ç„¦è™‘(5.63%)ã€‚åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜èŽ·å–COVID-19ç›¸å…³ä¿¡æ¯çš„ä¸»è¦æ¥æºåŒ…æ‹¬å¾®ä¿¡ã€å¾®åšå’Œä»Šæ—¥å¤´æ¡ã€ç”µè§†å’Œå¹¿æ’­ï¼›66.22%çš„åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜ä¼šç»å¸¸é€šè¿‡å®˜æ–¹ç½‘ç«™æˆ–æ­£è§„æ¸ é“æ¥è¯å®žæœ‰å…³COVID-19ä¿¡æ¯çš„çœŸå®žæ€§ï¼›å¾®ä¿¡é‡Œå¤§é‡COVID-19ç›¸å…³ä¿¡æ¯ä¼šè®©åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜æ„Ÿåˆ°ç´§å¼ (34.05%)ã€ç„¦è™‘(30.29%)ã€æ²¡æœ‰å®‰å…¨æ„Ÿ(29.22%)ï¼›68.63%çš„åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜æœ‰æ—¶ä¼šå› ä¸ºçœ‹åˆ°COVID-19ç›¸å…³ä¿¡æ¯è€Œæ‹…å¿ƒè‡ªå·±è¢«æ„ŸæŸ“ã€‚åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜å·¥ä½œçš„ç§‘å®¤ï¼Œè¿‘æœŸæ˜¯å¦å‡ºçŽ°å’³å—½ã€å‘çƒ­ç­‰ç—‡çŠ¶ï¼Œæ‹…å¿ƒè¢«æ„ŸæŸ“çš„ç¨‹åº¦ç­‰å¯¹åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜çš„SCL-90å¾—åˆ†æœ‰å½±å“ï¼Œå·®å¼‚å…·æœ‰ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(å‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚é€æ­¥å›žå½’åˆ†æžå‘çŽ°å¾®ä¿¡ä¸­è½¬å‘çš„å¤§é‡COVID-19ç›¸å…³ä¿¡æ¯å¯¹ç”Ÿæ´»çš„å½±å“ç¨‹åº¦ï¼Œè¿‘æœŸæœ‰æ— å’³å—½ã€å‘çƒ­ç­‰ç›¸å…³ç—‡çŠ¶ï¼Œå¾®ä¿¡ä¸­è½¬å‘çš„å¤§é‡COVID-19ç›¸å…³ä¿¡æ¯æ˜¯å¦è®©è‡ªå·±éš¾ä»¥å…¥ç¡ï¼Œå·¥ä½œçš„ç§‘å®¤åŠæ‹…å¿ƒè¢«æ„ŸæŸ“çš„ç¨‹åº¦æ˜¯åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜å¿ƒç†å¥åº·çš„å½±å“å› ç´ (å‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.05)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: COVID-19ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜ä¼šå‡ºçŽ°ä¸åŒç¨‹åº¦çš„å¿ƒç†é—®é¢˜ï¼Œå»ºè®®å»ºç«‹å¿ƒç†æ´åŠ©å¹³å°ï¼Œå¹¶æ­£ç¡®å¼•å¯¼èˆ†æƒ…æ–¹å‘ï¼Œä»¥ä¿ƒè¿›åŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ã€‚.","Shen, Wang, Zhou, Chen, Deng","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200070","20200903","coronavirus disease 2019; medical staff; mental health status; pneumonia; public opinion","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health of front-line staff in prevention of coronavirus disease 2019","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health crisis, which elicits psychological problems in different population<b>.</b> This study is to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in the front-line staff. Patient Health Questionnare-9 (PHQ-9), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Fatigue Self-assessment Scale (FSAS) were used to assess the depression, anxiety, and fatigue in front-line staff. The detection rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were 49.1%, 21.8%, and 76.0% among the front-line staff. The rates of depression, anxiety, and fatigue in community workers were higher than those in medical workers and other occupational staff (<i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The PHQ-9 of front-line staffs was negatively correlated with age, family income, family members' support, satisfaction of service objects, and sleep quality (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), while positively correlated with education level, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and the duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). SAS was negatively correlated with age, family income, family support, satisfaction of objects service, and sleep quality (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01), while positively correlated with gender, fatigue, fear of pneumonia, and duration of daily attention to the COVID-19 (all <i>P</i>&lt;0.01). The front-line workers should manage work and rest time reasonably to adjust their negative mood and fatigue. The government and the society should pay more attention to the psychological state of the front-line staff, particularly for the staff working in the community or villages and towns in preventing the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, front-line staff can be obtained mental intervention or be taken a rest from the high-intensive work. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: 2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)ç–«æƒ…ä¸ºå…¨çƒå…¬å…±å«ç”Ÿå±æœºï¼Œå¼•å‘äº†ä¸åŒäººç¾¤çš„å„ç§å¿ƒç†é—®é¢˜ã€‚æœ¬ç ”ç©¶æ—¨åœ¨äº†è§£COVID-19ç–«æƒ…å¯¹é˜²æŽ§ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜å¿ƒç†çŠ¶å†µçš„å½±å“ã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: åœ¨é—®å·æ˜Ÿå¹³å°é‡‡ç”¨ç”µå­é‡è¡¨è¿›è¡Œæ»šé›ªçƒæŠ½æ ·è°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œä½¿ç”¨æŠ‘éƒç—‡ç­›æŸ¥é‡è¡¨(Patient Health Questionnare-9ï¼ŒPHQ-9)ã€ç„¦è™‘è‡ªè¯„é‡è¡¨(Self-Rating Anxiety Scaleï¼ŒSAS)ã€ç–²åŠ³è‡ªè¯„é‡è¡¨(Fatigue Self-assessment Scaleï¼ŒFSAS)è¯„ä¼°ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜æŠ‘éƒã€ç„¦è™‘ã€ç–²åŠ³åº¦ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜æŠ‘éƒæ£€å‡ºçŽ‡49.1%ï¼Œç„¦è™‘æ£€å‡ºçŽ‡21.8%ï¼Œç–²åŠ³æ£€å‡ºçŽ‡76.0%ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­ç¤¾åŒºã€ä¹¡é•‡å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜æŠ‘éƒã€ç„¦è™‘ã€ç–²åŠ³æ£€å‡ºçŽ‡è¾ƒåŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜ã€å…¶ä»–èŒä¸šè€…é«˜(<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ã€‚ä¸€çº¿å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜çš„PHQ-9ä¸Žå¹´é¾„ã€å®¶åº­æ”¶å…¥ã€å®¶äººçš„æ”¯æŒã€æœåŠ¡å¯¹è±¡æ˜¯å¦æ»¡æ„ã€ç¡çœ è´¨é‡å‘ˆè´Ÿç›¸å…³(å‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œä¸Žæ–‡åŒ–ç¨‹åº¦ã€æ‹…å¿ƒæ„ŸæŸ“è‚ºç‚Žã€æ¯å¤©å…³æ³¨ç–«æƒ…çš„æ—¶é—´ä»¥åŠç–²åŠ³å‘ˆæ­£ç›¸å…³(å‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ã€‚SASä¸Žå¹´é¾„ã€å®¶åº­æ”¶å…¥ã€å®¶äººçš„æ”¯æŒã€æœåŠ¡å¯¹è±¡æ˜¯å¦æ»¡æ„ã€ç¡çœ è´¨é‡å‘ˆè´Ÿç›¸å…³(å‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ï¼Œä¸Žæ€§åˆ«ã€æ‹…å¿ƒæ„ŸæŸ“è‚ºç‚Žã€æ¯å¤©å…³æ³¨ç–«æƒ…çš„æ—¶é•¿ä»¥åŠç–²åŠ³å‘ˆæ­£ç›¸å…³(å‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.01)ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: ä¸€çº¿é˜²æŽ§å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜è‡ªèº«åº”åˆç†å®‰æŽ’å·¥ä½œå’Œä¼‘æ¯æ—¶é—´ï¼ŒåŠæ—¶è°ƒèŠ‚ä¸è‰¯æƒ…ç»ªï¼Œç¼“è§£ç–²åŠ³ï¼›æ”¿åºœéƒ¨é—¨å’Œç¤¾ä¼šåœ¨å…³æ³¨COVID-19ç–«æƒ…æ—¶ï¼Œä¹Ÿåº”å¤šå…³å¿ƒä¸€çº¿é˜²æŽ§å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜ï¼Œå°¤å…¶æ˜¯ç¤¾åŒºã€ä¹¡é•‡å·¥ä½œäººå‘˜çš„å¿ƒç†çŠ¶æ€ï¼ŒåŠæ—¶å¯¹ä»–ä»¬é‡‡å–è°ƒä¼‘ã€å¿ƒç†å¹²é¢„ç­‰æŽªæ–½ã€‚.","Teng, Huang, Qiu, Tan, Zhong, Tang, Wu, Wu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200241","20200903","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; fatigue; front-line staff; pneumonia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Effect of transfusion convalescent recovery plasma in patients with coronavirus disease 2019","To evaluate curative effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients by the transfusion of other convalescent plasma. Retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 18 patients with severe and critical COVID-19, who were hospitalized in the ICU of Xianghu Branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from February 1 to March 15, 2020. Patients were subdivided into an experimental group (<i>n</i>=6, who had transfused the plasma) and an observation group (<i>n</i>=12, who had no plasma transfusion). Basic clinical data and prognosis indexes of these two groups were compared. Moreover, for the experimental group, the dynamic changes of blood oxygen saturation before and after the transfusion, the changes of lymphocyte absolute value 48 hours after the transfusion, and the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nucleic acid were analyzed. There were no significant differences in age, gender, blood type and other basic clinical data between the two groups (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05).There were no significant differences in ventilator machine weaning time, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) weaning time, body temperature recovery to normal time, and hospitalization days between these two groups (all <i>P</i>&gt;0.05). For the experimental group, before, during and after the convalescent plasma transfusion, the blood oxygen saturation of all 6 patients at all time (1, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h) was more than 90%, and there was no significant fluctuation. There were 3 patients whose absolute value of lymphocyte was increased 48 hours after the transfusion, and the remaining was decreased. There were 5 patients whose SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection turned negative 48 hours after the transfusion, accounting for 83.3%. Transfusion of convalescent plasma will not affect outcomesof COVID-19 patients, which can neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in patients and reduce the loading capacity of SARS-CoV-2. <b>ç›®çš„</b>: è¯„ä»·2019å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç—…(coronavirus disease 2019ï¼ŒCOVID-19)æ‚£è€…è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†çš„ç–—æ•ˆã€‚<b>æ–¹æ³•</b>: å›žé¡¾æ€§åˆ†æž2020å¹´2æœˆ1æ—¥è‡³3æœˆ15æ—¥åœ¨å—æ˜Œå¤§å­¦ç¬¬ä¸€é™„å±žåŒ»é™¢è±¡æ¹–é™¢åŒºé‡ç—‡åŒ»å­¦ç§‘ä½é™¢æ²»ç–—çš„18åé‡åž‹ã€å±é‡åž‹COVID-19æ‚£è€…çš„ä¸´åºŠèµ„æ–™ï¼Œå¹¶æ ¹æ®æ˜¯å¦è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†å°†æ‚£è€…åˆ†ä¸ºå®žéªŒç»„(è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†è€…ï¼Œ<i>n</i>=6)å’Œè§‚å¯Ÿç»„(æœªè¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†è€…ï¼Œ<i>n</i>=12)ã€‚æ¯”è¾ƒä¸¤ç»„æ‚£è€…ä¸´åºŠåŸºæœ¬èµ„æ–™åŠé¢„åŽæŒ‡æ ‡ï¼Œå¹¶è¿›ä¸€æ­¥åˆ†æžå®žéªŒç»„æ‚£è€…è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†å‰ã€åŽçš„è¡€æ°§é¥±å’Œåº¦çš„åŠ¨æ€å˜åŒ–ï¼Œè¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†åŽ48 hæ·‹å·´ç»†èƒžç»å¯¹å€¼çš„å˜åŒ–åŠä¸¥é‡æ€¥æ€§å‘¼å¸ç»¼åˆå¾å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’2(severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2ï¼ŒSARS-CoV-2)æ ¸é…¸æ£€æµ‹ç»“æžœæ˜¯å¦è½¬é˜´ã€‚<b>ç»“æžœ</b>: ä¸¤ç»„æ‚£è€…å¹´é¾„ã€æ€§åˆ«ã€è¡€åž‹ç­‰ä¸´åºŠåŸºæœ¬èµ„æ–™å·®å¼‚å‡æ— ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(å‡<i>P</i>&gt;0.05)ã€‚ä¸¤ç»„æ‚£è€…å‘¼å¸æœºæ’¤æœºæ—¶é—´ã€ä½“å¤–è†œæ°§åˆ(extracorporeal membrane oxygenationï¼ŒECMO)æ’¤æœºæ—¶é—´ã€ä½“æ¸©æ¢å¤è‡³æ­£å¸¸æ—¶é—´åŠä½é™¢å¤©æ•°æ–¹é¢çš„å·®å¼‚å‡æ— ç»Ÿè®¡å­¦æ„ä¹‰(å‡<i>P</i>&gt;0.05)ã€‚å®žéªŒç»„6åæ‚£è€…è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†å‰ã€è¾“æ³¨è¿‡ç¨‹ä¸­ã€è¾“æ³¨åŽå„æ—¶é—´ç‚¹(1ï¼Œ6ï¼Œ8ï¼Œ12ï¼Œ24ï¼Œ36ï¼Œ48 h)è¡€æ°§é¥±å’Œåº¦å‡åœ¨90%ä»¥ä¸Šï¼Œäº¦æœªè§æ˜Žæ˜¾æ³¢åŠ¨ã€‚å®žéªŒç»„3ä½æ‚£è€…è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†åŽ48 hæ·‹å·´ç»†èƒžç»å¯¹å€¼è¾ƒè¾“æ³¨å‰å‡é«˜ï¼Œå¦3ä½æ‚£è€…æ·‹å·´ç»†èƒžç»å¯¹å€¼è¾ƒè¾“æ³¨å‰å‡å°‘ã€‚å®žéªŒç»„æœ‰5åæ‚£è€…è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†åŽ48 h SARS-CoV-2æ ¸é…¸æ£€æµ‹ç»“æžœè½¬é˜´ï¼Œè½¬é˜´çŽ‡ä¸º83.3%ã€‚<b>ç»“è®º</b>: è¾“æ³¨åº·å¤è€…æ¢å¤æœŸè¡€æµ†æœªå½±å“COVID-19æ‚£è€…é¢„åŽï¼Œèƒ½è¿…é€Ÿä¸­å’ŒCOVID-19æ‚£è€…ä½“å†…çš„SARS-CoV-2ï¼Œé™ä½ŽSARS-CoV-2è½½é‡ã€‚.","Xiao, Lin, Fan, Wen, Huang, Wang, Ren, Wu, Liu, Zhang, Li, LE","https://doi.org/10.11817/j.issn.1672-7347.2020.200318","20200903","convalescent recovery plasma; coronavirus disease 2019; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental and behavioural disorders and COVID-19-associated death in older people","Health factors such as diabetes, severe obesity and chronic kidney disease are all associated with a more severe outcome following coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. However, there has been little exploration into the impact of mental and behavioural disorders on outcomes associated with COVID-19. We investigated outcomes for older people who used mental health services. Those who had a COVID-19-associated death had previously rated worse across a range of health and social problems, including mental health related problems. Our findings evidence the need to urgently explore whether mental and behavioural disorders should also be considered a health risk factor for a more severe outcome from COVID-19 infection in older people.","Boland, Gale","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.87","20200903","COVID-19; Comorbidity; dementia; mortality; rating scales","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 Concerns Among Persons With Mental Illness","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has been recognized as causing a wide variety of behavioral health problems. Society must mitigate this impact by recognizing that COVID-19 can trigger people's fears of exacerbating an existing mental illness. A survey about COVID-19 for people with mental illness was developed. Two hundred fourteen people responded to the survey, of whom 193 self-identified as living with a mental illness. Almost all participants living with a mental illness (98%) said they had at least one major concern regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and 62% said they had at least three major concerns. People living with a mental illness are very concerned about disruption of services, running out of medication, and social isolation during this pandemic. Providers and mental health services could address these fears by connecting with people living with mental illness through text messaging and social media.","Costa, Pavlo, Reis, Ponte, Davidson","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000245","20200903","pandemic; patient needs; patient perceptions","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health and Its Predictors during the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic Experience in the United States","To date, there has been relatively little published research on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 for the general public at the beginning of the U.S.' experience of the pandemic, or the factors associated with stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic growth during this time. The current study provides a longitudinal examination of the predictors of self-reported stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic growth for U.S. residents between April and May, 2020, including the influence of demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral factors on these outcomes. The findings indicate that, generally, the early months of the U.S. COVID-19 experience were characterized by a modest negative impact on mental health. Younger adults, people with pre-existing health conditions, and those experiencing greater perceived risk, higher levels of rumination, higher levels of co-rumination, greater social strain, or less social support reported worse mental health. Positive mental health was associated with the adoption of coping strategies, especially those that were forward-looking, and with greater adherence to national health-protection guidelines. The findings are discussed with regard to the current status of health-protective measures and mental health in the U.S., especially as these impact future management of the on-going pandemic.","Zhou, MacGeorge, Myrick","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176315","20200903","COVID-19; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21); longitudinal design; mental health; posttraumatic growth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Healthcare professionals' perceptions of critical care resource availability and factors associated with mental well-being during COVID-19: Results from a US survey","Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on intensive care unit (ICU) providers' perceptions of resource availability and evaluating factors associated with emotional distress/burnout can inform interventions to promote provider well-being. Between April 23-May 7, 2020, we electronically administered a survey to physicians, nurses, respiratory therapist (RTs) and advanced practice providers (APPs) caring for COVID-19 patients in the US. We conducted multivariate regression to assess associations between concerns, reported lack of resources and three outcomes: emotional distress/burnout (primary outcome), and two secondary outcomes: 1) fear that hospital is unable to keep providers safe, and 2) concern about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community. We included 1,651 respondents from all 50 states; 47% nurses, 25% physicians, 17% RTs, 11% APPS. Shortages of intensivists and ICU nurses were reported by 12% and 28% of providers, respectively. The largest supply restrictions reported were for powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs); (56% reporting restricted availability). Provider concerns included worries about transmitting COVID-19 to family/community (66%), emotional distress/burnout (58%), and insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) (40%). After adjustment, emotional distress/burnout was significantly associated with insufficient PPE access (aRR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.32 - 1.55), stigma from community (aRR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.24 - 1.41), and poor communication with supervisors (aRR:1.13, 95% CI: 1.06 - 1.21). Insufficient PPE access was the strongest predictor of feeling that the hospital is unable to keep providers safe and worries about transmitting infection to families/communities. Addressing insufficient PPE access, poor communication from supervisors, and community stigma may improve provider mental well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sharma, Creutzfeldt, Lewis, Patel, Hartog, Jannotta, Blissitt, Kross, Kassebaum, Greer, Curtis, Wahlster","https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1311","20200902","COVID-19; burnout; critical care resources; healthcare provider; mental health; personal protective equipment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Fertility patients under COVID-19: Attitudes, Perceptions, and Psychological Reactions","What are the perceptions of infertility patients and the factors correlating with their psychological distress, following suspension of fertility treatments during the COVID-19 pandemic? Most patients preferred to resume treatment given the chance regardless of background characteristics; higher self-mastery and greater perceived social support were associated with lower distress, while feeling helpless was associated with higher distress. Infertility diagnosis and treatment frequently result in significant psychological distress. Recently published data has shown that clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a sharp increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among infertile patients undergoing IVF and was perceived as an uncontrollable and stressful event. Personal resources play an important protective role in times of crisis, helping reduce levels of distress. This cross-sectional questionnaire study included patients whose fertility treatment was suspended following the COVID-19 pandemic, in a tertiary hospital. The survey was delivered to 297 patients within 12 days at the beginning of April 2020. The self-administered questionnaire included items addressing: 1. patients' demographic characteristics, 2. anxiety related to COVID-19 infection risk and level of social support, 3. patients' perceptions of the new guidelines and description of subsequently related emotions, and 4. two validated scales assessing levels of emotional distress and self-mastery. Multivariate analysis was conducted to assess factors alleviating or increasing emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were 168 patients who completed the survey, giving a response rate of 57%. Study variables in the regression model explained 38.9% of the variance in psychological distress experienced by patients during treatment suspension. None of the background characteristics (e.g. age, marital status, parity, economic level or duration of treatments) had a significant contribution. Feeling helpless following the suspension of treatments was associated with higher distress (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Higher self-mastery and greater perceived social support were associated with lower distress (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01). Despite the ministry of health's decision, 72% of patients wished to resume treatment at the time of survey. This was a cross-sectional study, thus information about patients' characteristics prior to the COVID-19 pandemic was not available. The length and implications of this pandemic are unknown. Therefore, the ability to draw conclusions about the psychological consequences of the crisis is limited at this point of time. Personal resources play an important protective role in times of crisis, helping to reduce levels of distress. Study ï¬ndings suggest that attention should be paid to strengthening and empowering patients' personal resources together with directly confronting and containing feelings of helplessness. In line with the ESHRE guidelines, especially at this time of high levels of distress, it is imperative to offer emotional support to reduce stress and concerns. Furthermore, as the pandemic is stabilising, resumption of treatment should be considered as soon as appropriate according to local conditions. This study was funded by the IVF unit of the Shamir Medical Center. All authors declare no conflicts of interest.","Ben-Kimhy, Youngster, Medina-Artom, Avraham, Gat, Haham, Hourvitz, Kedem","https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deaa248","20200902","COVID-19; IVF; fertility treatments; infertility; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 News Exposure as a Modifiable Risk Factor of Psychological Symptoms: Can an Official WhatsApp Channel Help?","In a global pandemic, digital technology offers innovative methods to disseminate public health messages. As an example, the messenger application WhatsApp was adopted by both the World Health Organization and government agencies to provide updates on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). During a time when rumours and excessive news threaten psychological well-being, these services allow for rapid transmission of information and may boost resilience. In this study, we sought to: (1) assess well-being during the pandemic; (2) replicate prior findings linking exposure to COVID-19 news with psychological distress; and (3) examine whether subscription to an official WhatsApp channel can mitigate this risk. Across 8 weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak (7 March - 21 April 2020), we conducted a survey of 1145 adults in Singapore. As the primary outcome measure, participants completed the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As predictor variables, participants also answered questions pertaining to: (1) their exposure to COVID-19 news; (2) their use of the Singapore government's WhatsApp channel; and (3) their demographics. Within the sample, 7.9% of participants had severe or extremely severe symptoms on at least one DASS-21 subscale. Depression scores were associated with increased duration spent receiving COVID-19 updates, whereas use of the official WhatsApp channel emerged as a protective factor (b = -.07, t(863) = -2.04, P = 0.04). Similarly, increased anxiety scores were associated with increased exposure to both updates and rumours, but this risk was mitigated by trust in the government's WhatsApp messages (b = -.05, t(863) = -2.13, P = 0.03). Finally, although stress symptoms increased with the duration spent receiving updates, these symptoms were not significantly related to WhatsApp use. Our findings suggest that messenger apps may be an effective medium to disseminate pandemic-related information, allowing official agencies to reach a broad sector of the population rapidly. In turn, this use may promote public well-being amidst an 'infodemic'.

"Prevalence of Depression Symptoms in US Adults Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the policies to contain it have been a near ubiquitous exposure in the US with unknown effects on depression symptoms. To estimate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with depression symptoms among US adults during vs before the COVID-19 pandemic. This nationally representative survey study used 2 population-based surveys of US adults aged 18 or older. During COVID-19, estimates were derived from the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study, conducted from March 31, 2020, to April 13, 2020. Before COVID-19 estimates were derived from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted from 2017 to 2018. Data were analyzed from April 15 to 20, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and outcomes associated with the measures to mitigate it. Depression symptoms, defined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 cutoff of 10 or higher. Categories of depression symptoms were defined as none (score, 0-4), mild (score, 5-9), moderate (score, 10-14), moderately severe (score, 15-19), and severe (score, â‰¥20). A total of 1470 participants completed the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being survey (completion rate, 64.3%), and after removing those with missing data, the final during-COVID-19 sample included 1441 participants (619 participants [43.0%] aged 18-39 years; 723 [50.2%] men; 933 [64.7%] non-Hispanic White). The pre-COVID-19 sample included 5065 participants (1704 participants [37.8%] aged 18-39 years; 2588 [51.4%] women; 1790 [62.9%] non-Hispanic White). Depression symptom prevalence was higher in every category during COVID-19 compared with before (mild: 24.6% [95% CI, 21.8%-27.7%] vs 16.2% [95% CI, 15.1%-17.4%]; moderate: 14.8% [95% CI, 12.6%-17.4%] vs 5.7% [95% CI, 4.8%-6.9%]; moderately severe: 7.9% [95% CI, 6.3%-9.8%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.6%-2.8%]; severe: 5.1% [95% CI, 3.8%-6.9%] vs 0.7% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%]). Higher risk of depression symptoms during COVID-19 was associated with having lower income (odds ratio, 2.37 [95% CI, 1.26-4.43]), having less than $5000 in savings (odds ratio, 1.52 [95% CI, 1.02-2.26]), and exposure to more stressors (odds ratio, 3.05 [95% CI, 1.95-4.77]). These findings suggest that prevalence of depression symptoms in the US was more than 3-fold higher during COVID-19 compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with lower social resources, lower economic resources, and greater exposure to stressors (eg, job loss) reported a greater burden of depression symptoms.

"The health of healthcare professionals coping with the Covid-19 pandemic","This work aims to systematize a set of scientific evidence presented in international papers that identify the main problems affecting health professionals directly involved in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic and point out actions and strategies for the protection and healthcare of these professionals. The risk of infection is the main issue and has led to absence from work, illness, death, and intense psychological distress, expressed in generalized anxiety and sleep disorders, fear of becoming ill and infecting colleagues and relatives. In the Brazilian reality, this work revives the analysis of the chronic problems affecting health workers, resulting from the underfinancing of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), the sector's spending freeze, the deterioration of services and workforce's insecurity, and points out the acute challenges of work management and staff training, given the expanded hospital bed infrastructure and reorganization of the work process in primary care to face the pandemic, emphasizing the necessary measures for the protection and promotion of the physical and mental health of health professionals and workers.","Teixeira, Soares, Souza, Lisboa, Pinto, Andrade, EspiridiÃ£o","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.19562020","20200902",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Covid-19 and the impacts on mental health: a sample from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil","Pandemics such as that of COVID-19 affect a relatively large number of people and impose new rules and social habits on the world population. Information about the pandemic is constant in the media. Moreover, social distancing has been adopted in Brazil to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may have economic and psychosocial consequences. This study aimed to verify the factors associated with indicators of mental disorders symptoms in residents of Rio Grande do Sul during the initial period of the social distancing policy. The study was approved by CONEP. There were 799 participants, aged between 18 and 75 years (M = 36.56; SD = 12.88); 82.7% were women, who answered a sociodemographic questionnaire of social distancing and the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The results indicated that having decreased income in the period, being part of the risk group and being more exposed to information about deaths and infected, are factors that can significantly harm mental health in this pandemic period. Investigating social determinants that contribute to greater vulnerability to the mental illness of the population is vital in the field of collective health for the planning of public actions and policies.","Duarte, Santo, Lima, Giordani, Trentini","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.16472020","20200902",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The pandemic in prison: interventions and overisolation","Prisional health is, in its essence, public health. The COVID-19 pandemic poses a great threat to the world and has shown that preventing the disease escalation in prisons integrates the novel corona virus clash in society in general. Up to this moment, the most effective known measure to curb the disease spread is social isolation. Nevertheless, in penal institutions, often overcrowded, social isolation becomes difficult to carry out and, when it happens, it takes the enclosed population to overisolation, with consequences to their mental health. Besides, prisoners suffer with clogged up environment, lack of materials for personal hygiene, poor basic sanitary conditions and difficulties in accessing health services. This paper deals with a narrative review on the pandemic effects in prisons and how government and civil society have organized themselves in order to reduce the disease consequences at those places. The text has been divided into three sections: the first with literature review on the current health theme; the second discusses how different countries have been dealing with the prison situation in the pandemic context, and, the last part focuses on how the Brazilian Penal System has reacted to the new disease.","Carvalho, Santos, Santos","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020259.15682020","20200902",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
NA,"Since December 2019, 414,179 cases of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. We believe that addressing them adequately will empower Peru to contain and eradicate COVID-19. Desde diciembre de 2019 se han reportado 414Â 179 casos de personas con la enfermedad por coronavirus (COVID-19). Como resultado del rÃ¡pido incremento de casos confirmados y muertes, la poblaciÃ³n general y el personal de salud experimentaron problemas psicolÃ³gicos, como ansiedad, depresiÃ³n y estrÃ©s.

"Adolescents' health in times of COVID-19: a scoping review","COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 (novel coronavirus), emerged in China in December 2019 and spread quickly throughout the world. In this scenario, the current study aimed to identify the impact or effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on adolescents' health. This is a scoping literature review based on the following databases: Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SciELO, and PUBCOVID19. The study adopted the stages proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute for scoping reviews, and the question orienting the procedures consisted of the acronym PCC (population; concept; context). Eleven articles were included in the review. Clinically, adolescents present the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults. The pandemic and the health measures taken to control transmission were found to be associated with mental health problems in adolescents. Specifically, adolescents have a negative experience with social distancing measures and closing of schools. These measures can also favor situations of violence or aggressive behaviors in the home environment. Healthcare services that treat the adolescent population had to reorient their practices, adopting a virtual model to replace face-to-face care, and even research projects involving adolescence had to be rethought. This scoping review addressed an emerging theme in relation to a population that has received little attention in studies on COVID-19. The results suggest that the pandemic can be considered a determinant that affects different dimensions of adolescents' lives.","Oliveira, Silva, Andrade, Micheli, Carlos, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00150020","20200902",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Impact Among Spine Surgeons in Latin America","Cross-sectional study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in spine surgeons in Latin America. A questionnaire was sent to Latin American spine surgeons from April 4 to 6, 2020. Surgeon characteristics were recorded. The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined. All variables were compared and analyzed. Two hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons. The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12). Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156). Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111). The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario). Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis). Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores. COVID-19 has an impact in the daily working practice and financial situation of spine surgeons in Latin America. The long-term psychological impact should be taken into consideration to avoid a heavier burden for health care providers.","Guiroy, Gagliardi, Coombes, Landriel, Zanardi, Camino Willhuber, Guyot, Valacco","https://doi.org/10.1177/2192568220928032","20200902","COVID-19; Latin America; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; SARS-Cov-2; depression; spine surgeons; spine surgery","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Developing a Virtual Adaptive Sports Program in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic","In recent years, adaptive sports have become a mainstay of the rehabilitation process given their potential to enhance physical and mental health outcomes in people with disabilities.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Sports Medicine Fellowship Class of 2020","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many US health systems suspended elective surgery at the recommendation of the US Surgeon General. This dramatically decreased case volumes for orthopaedic sports medicine fellows at academic institutions. To describe how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the education of the sports medicine fellowship class of 2020 as well as the subsequent effects on their career plans and psychological well-being. Cross-sectional study. A 33-item survey was distributed via email to all American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) 2020 fellow members on April 22, 2020. Frequencies are presented as raw totals and percentages of respondents. The Fisher exact test was used to determine statistical significance between nominal variables, with significance set at <i>P</i> &lt; .05. Of 210 registered fellows, 101 (48.1%) responded. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the typical case volume per week for most fellows (47.5%) was 11 to 15 cases. From the enactment of COVID-19 mitigation policies to the date of survey completion, 90.1% of fellows had performed fewer than 20 cases. A total of 32 fellows were presented with redeployment options by their fellowship program, with 10 redeployed mandatorily to other hospital departments. Fellows reported that web-based didactics (n = 100) and web-based journal clubs (n = 72) were utilized as alternative supplements in the absence of clinical education. There were 8 respondents who had either their prior contract or job offer rescinded, while 1 had a signed contract voided. As a result, 6 fellows now plan to matriculate into a previously unplanned fellowship. Also, 10 respondents' intended practice start date was being delayed by their employer. Respondents whose postfellowship plans were affected were statistically more likely to experience doubts about readiness for practice (58.8% vs 20.3%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .005), anxiety about future career plans (94.4% vs 63.8%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .01), anxiety about their financial situation (86.7% vs 50.8%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .018), stress in personal relationships (58.8% vs 29.9%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .045), and signs or symptoms of depression (41.2% vs 11.1%, respectively; <i>P</i> = .007) compared with those whose plans were not affected. This survey illustrates that during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent suspension of elective surgery, there have been downstream effects to this group's education, careers, board certification timeline, and potentially their social and/or emotional well-being.","Perrone, Youssefzadeh, Serrano, Limpisvasti, Banffy","https://doi.org/10.1177/2325967120939901","20200903","COVID-19; coronavirus; education; epidemiology; fellowship; pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Review of possible psychological impacts of COVID-19 on frontline medical staff and reduction strategies","Like soldiers, frontline medical staff provide a first line of defense and have played a critical role in responses to the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 in December 2019. It is important to acknowledge the considerable pressure placed on frontline medical staff in the face of a new type of coronavirus that is highly infectious and for which no specific treatment is available. Here, we review the various kinds of psychological problems afflicting frontline medical staff who are combatting the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic. These include anxiety, insomnia, depression, interpersonal difficulties, and post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome. We further present a summary of countermeasures for alleviating these problems based on our findings. These countermeasures include ensuring the provision of adequate protective gear for frontline medical staff, developing timely and clear guidelines, strengthening social support, and providing clear criteria and additional training, focusing on the choice of frontline medical staff. An understanding of the psychological impacts of an epidemic situation and of relevant countermeasures will contribute to reducing the psychological pressures on frontline medical staff. Consequently, they will be able to cope better with outbreaks of infectious diseases in the future, to reduce the psychological pressure of the front-line medical staff, and to improve the treatment level.","Fu, Wu, Shan","https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i15.3188","20200903","Adequate protective gear; Epidemic diseases; Frontline medical staff; Post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome; Psychological impacts","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Medical research during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which was first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019 is caused by the novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The virus has quickly spread to a large number of countries leading to a great number of deaths. Unfortunately, till today there is no specific treatment or vaccination for SARS-CoV-2. Most of the suggested treatment medications are based on <i>in vitro</i> laboratory investigations, experimental animal models, or previous clinical experience in treating similar viruses such as SARS-CoV-1 or other retroviral infections. The running of any clinical trial during a pandemic is affected at multiple levels. Reasons for this include patient hesitancy or inability to continue investigative treatments due to self-isolation/quarantine, or limited access to public places (including hospitals). Additional barriers relate to health care professionals being committed to other critical tasks or quarantining themselves due to contact with COVID-19 positive patients. The best research approaches are those that adapt to such external unplanned obstacles. Ongoing clinical trials before COVID-19 pandemic have the potential for identifying important therapies in the long-term if they can be completed as planned. However, these clinical trials may require modifications due a pandemic such as this one to ensure the rights, safety, and wellbeing of participants as well as medical staff involved in the conduction of clinical trials. Clinical trials initiated during the pandemic must be time-efficient and flexible due to high contagiousness of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the significant number of reported deaths, and time constraints needed to perform high quality clinical trials, enrolling adequate sample sizes. Collaboration between different countries as well as implementation of innovative clinical trial designs are essential to successfully complete such initiatives during the current pandemic. Studies looking at the long term sequalae of COVID-19 are also of importance as recent publications describe multi-organ involvement. Long term follow-up of COVID-19 survivors is thus also important to identify possible physical and mental health sequellae.","AlNaamani, AlSinani, Barkun","https://doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v8.i15.3156","20200903","COVID-19; Clinical trials; Pandemic; Research; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Rapid response to crisis: Health System Lessons from the active period of COVID-19: A Framework for Rapid Response","<b>Background:</b> This paper outlines the need for a health systems approach and rapid response strategy for gathering information necessary for policy decisions during pandemics and similar crises. It suggests a new framework for assessing the phases of the pandemic. <b>Method:</b> The paper draws its information and conclusions from a rapid synthesis and translation process (RSTP) of a series of webinars and online discussions from the Pandemic-Mental Health International Network (Pan-MHIN) - policy experts from across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the USA. While the initial focus of this research was on mental health, COVID-19 has raised much broader issues and questions for health planners. <b>Results:</b> We identified gaps affecting the capacity to respond effectively and quickly, including in relation to system indicators, the inadequacy of the prior classification of the phases of the pandemic, the absences of a healthcare ecosystem approach, and the quick shift to digital technologies. The strengths and weaknesses of COVID-19 responses across different systems, services, sites and countries been identified and compared, including both low and high impacted areas. <b>Conclusions:</b> There is an urgent need for managerial epidemiology based on healthcare ecosystem research encompassing multidisciplinary teams, visualization tools and decision analytics for rapid response. Policy and healthcare context played a key role in the response to COVID-19. Its severity, the containment measures and the societal response varied greatly across sites and countries. Understanding this variation is vital to assess the impact of COVID-19 in specific areas such as ageing or mental health.","Salvador-Carulla, Rosenberg, Mendoza, Tabatabaei-Jafari","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.011","20200903","COVID-19; Health Planning; Health Systems Research; Information Systems","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"International Experiences of the Active Period of COVID-19 - Mental Health Care","To summarise commonalities and variations in the mental health response to COVID-19 across different sites and countries, with a view to better understanding key steps not only in crisis management, but for future systemic reform of mental health care. Method We conducted a Rapid Synthesis and Translation Process of lessons learned from an international panel of experts, collecting on the ground experiences of the pandemic as it evolved in real time. Digital conferencing and individual interviews were used to rapidly acquire knowledge on the COVID-19 outbreak across 16 locations in Australia, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Taiwan, the UK, and the USA. Results COVID-19 has had massive impacts on mental health care internationally. Most systems were under-resourced and under-prepared, struggling to manage both existing and new clients. There were significant differences between sites, depending on the explosivity the pandemic and the readiness of the mental health system. Integrated, community mental health systems exhibited greater adaptability in contrast to services which depended on face-to-face and hospital-based care. COVID-19 has demonstrated the need for a new approach to rapid response to crisis in mental health. New decision support system tools are necessary to ensure local decision-makers can effectively respond to the enormous practical challenges posed in these circumstances. Conclusions The process we have undertaken has generated clear lessons for mental health policymakers worldwide, beyond pandemic planning and response to guide next steps in systemic mental health reform. Key here is achieving some balance between national leadership and local context adaptation of evidence.","Rosenberg, Mendoza, Jafari, Carulla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2020.08.016","20200903","COVID-19; Health Planning; Health Systems Research; Mental Health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Effect of 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic on Ophthalmologists Practicing in Saudi Arabia: A Psychological Health Assessment","To assess the psychological impact and mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, and insomnia during COVID-19 crisis among ophthalmologists. This was a simple random study in which ophthalmologists practicing in Saudi Arabia were asked to fill in a self-administered online survey during the period from March 28, 2020, to April 04, 2020. Four validated psychiatric assessment tools were used to detect symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and stress perception. One hundred and seven participants successfully completed the survey with a response rate of 30.6%. Males constituted 56.1% (<i>n</i> = 60). Ophthalmology residents constituted the majority (<i>n</i> = 66, 61.7%). About half of the physicians exhibited symptoms of depression (<i>n</i> = 56, 50.5%), anxiety (<i>n</i> = 50, 46.7%), and insomnia (<i>n</i> = 48, 44.9%). Symptoms of stress ranged between low (28%), moderate (68.2%), and high (3.7%). According to the cutoff values for severe symptoms, 29% were identified as having depression, 38.3% had anxiety, and 15% had insomnia.Depression was found to be more common among female ophthalmologists (<i>P</i> = 0.06), those living with an elderly (<i>P</i> = 0.003), and fellows (<i>P</i> = 0.006). Female ophthalmologists suffering from anxiety were significantly more than male ophthalmologists (<i>P</i> = 0.046). There was a trend toward suffering from anxiety in frontline health-care providers (<i>P</i> = 0.139) and in ophthalmologists who are living with an elderly (<i>P</i> = 0.149). Female participants exhibited significantly more moderate-to-high symptoms of stress (<i>P</i> = 0.018).

"Impact of COVID-19 and other pandemics and epidemics on people with pre-existing mental disorders: a systematic review protocol and suggestions for clinical care","The current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in high rates of infection and death, as well as widespread social disruption and a reduction in access to healthcare services and support. There is growing concern over how the pandemic, as well as measures put in place to curb the pandemic, will impact people with mental disorders. We aim to study the effect of pandemics and epidemics on mental health outcomes for people with premorbid mental disorders. With our predefined search strategy, we will search five databases for studies reporting on mental health outcomes in people with pre-existing mental disorders during pandemic and epidemic settings. Search dates are planned as follows: 5 May 2020 and 23 July 2020. The following databases will be searched: MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, MedRxiv and EMBASE. Data will be screened and extracted in duplicate by two independent reviewers. Studies involving non-clinical populations or patients diagnosed with a mental disorder <i>during</i> a pandemic/epidemic will be excluded. We will include data collected from all pandemics and epidemics throughout history, including the present COVID-19 pandemic. If possible, study findings will be combined in meta-analyses, and subgroup analyses will be performed. We hope that this review will shed light on the impact of pandemics and epidemics on those with pre-existing mental disorders. Knowledge generated may inform future intervention studies as well as healthcare policies. Given the potential implications of the current pandemic measures (ie, disruption of healthcare services) on mental health, we will also compile a list of existing mental health resources.

"The Protective Impact of Telemedicine on Persons With Dementia and Their Caregivers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Social distancing under the COVID-19 pandemic has restricted access to community services for older adults with neurocognitive disorder (NCD) and their caregivers. Telehealth is a viable alternative to face-to-face service delivery. Telephone calls alone, however, may be insufficient. Here, we evaluated whether supplementary telehealth via video-conferencing platforms could bring additional benefits to care-recipient with NCD and their spousal caregivers at home. Sixty older adults NCD-and-caregiver dyads were recruited through an activity center. The impact of additional services delivered to both care-recipient and caregiver through video conference (nâ€¯=â€¯30) was compared with telehealth targeted at caregivers by telephone only (nâ€¯=â€¯30), over 4 weeks in a pretest-post-test design. Interviews and questionnaires were conducted at baseline and study's end. Supplementary telemedicine had averted the deterioration in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment evident in the telephone-only group (Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>â€¯=â€¯0.50). It also reversed the falling trend in quality of life observed in the telephone only group (QoL-AD, Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>â€¯=â€¯0.23). Varying degrees of improvements in physical and mental health (Short-Form 36 v2), perceived burden (Zarit Burden Interview Scale) and self-efficacy (Revised Caregiving Self-Efficacy Scale) were observed among caregivers in the video-conferencing group, which were absent in the telephone-only group (Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>â€¯=â€¯0.23-0.51). Telemedicine by video conference was associated with improved resilience and wellbeing to both people with NCD and their caregivers at home. The benefits were visible already after 4 weeks and unmatched by telephone alone. Video conference as the modus operandi of telehmedicine beyond the context of pandemic-related social distancing should be considered.","Lai, Yan, Yu, Tsui, Chan, Yee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.019","20200902","COVID-19 pandemic; Caregiver; dementia; telehealth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A rapid systematic review exploring the involvement of medical students in pandemics and other global health emergencies","The role of medical students in the current COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving. The aim of this review is to explore the involvement of medical students in past global health emergencies, to help inform current and future scenarios. A rapid systematic review was undertaken, including articles from online databases discussing the roles, willingness and appropriateness of medical student involvement in global health emergencies. Data were extracted, appraised and written up as a narrative synthesis. This paper was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020177231). 28 articles were included. Medical students played a wide variety of clinical and non-clinical roles including education and logistics, although medical assistance was the most commonly reported role. Challenges included a lack of preparedness and negative mental health impacts. 91.7% of included articles about willingness found medical students were more willing to be involved than not. This review shows medical students are capable and willing to be involved in global health emergencies.

"Mental health implications of COVID-19 pandemic and its response in India","Mental health concerns and treatment usually take a backseat when the limited resources are geared for pandemic containment. In this global humanitarian crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health issues have been reported from all over the world. In this study, we attempt to review the prevailing mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic through global experiences, and reactive strategies established in mental health care with special reference to the Indian context. By performing a rapid synthesis of available evidence, we aim to propose a conceptual and recommendation framework for mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. A search of the PubMed electronic database and google scholar were undertaken using the search terms 'novel coronavirus', 'COVID-19', 'nCoV', SARS-CoV-2, 'mental health', 'psychiatry', 'psychology', 'anxiety', 'depression' and 'stress' in various permutations and combinations. Published journals, magazines and newspaper articles, official webpages and independent websites of various institutions and non-government organizations, verified social media portals were compiled. The major mental health issues reported were stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger and fear. Children and older people, frontline workers, people with existing mental health illnesses were among the vulnerable in this context. COVID-19 related suicides have also been increasingly common. Globally, measures have been taken to address mental health issues through the use of guidelines and intervention strategies. The role of social media has also been immense in this context. State-specific intervention strategies, telepsychiatry consultations, toll free number specific for psychological and behavioral issues have been issued by the Government of India. Keeping a positive approach, developing vulnerable-group-specific need-based interventions with proper risk communication strategies and keeping at par with the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 would be instrumental in guiding the planning and prioritization of mental health care resources to serve the most vulnerable.","Roy, Singh, Mishra, Chinnadurai, Mitra, Bakshi","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020950769","20200902","COVID-19; Mental health; anxiety; depression; pandemic; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What Protective Health Measures Are Americans Taking in Response to COVID-19? Results from the COVID Impact Survey","With the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes; COVID-19, compliance with/adherence to protective measures is needed. Information is needed on which measures are, or are not, being undertaken. Data collected from the COVID Impact Survey, conducted by the non-partisan and objective research organization NORC at the University of Chicago on April, May, and June of 2020, were analyzed through weighted Quasi-Poisson regression modeling to determine the association of demographics, socioeconomics, and health conditions with protective health measures taken at the individual level in response to COVID-19. The three surveys included data from 18 regional areas including 10 states (CA, CO, FL, LA, MN, MO, MT, NY, OR, and TX) and 8 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (Atlanta, GA; Baltimore, MD; Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Cleveland and Columbus, OH; Phoenix, AZ; and Pittsburgh, PA). Individuals with higher incomes, insurance, higher education levels, large household size, age 60+, females, minorities, those who have asthma, have hypertension, overweight or obese, and those who suffer from mental health issues during the pandemic were significantly more likely to report taking precautionary protective measures relative to their counterparts. Protective measures for the three subgroups with a known relationship to COVID-19 (positive for COVID-19, knowing an individual with COVID-19, and knowing someone who had died from COVID-19) were strongly associated with the protective health measures of washing hands, avoiding public places, and canceling social engagements. This study provides first baseline data on the response to the national COVID-19 pandemic at the individual level in the US. The found heterogeneity in the response to this pandemic by different variables can inform future research and interventions to reduce exposure to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Qeadan, Akofua Mensah, Tingey, Bern, Rees, Talboys, Pal Singh, Lacey, Shoaf","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176295","20200904","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; protective health measures; public health; risk behavior","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Determinants of the Lifestyle Changes during COVID-19 Pandemic in the Residents of Northern Italy","The confinement recommended during COVID-19 pandemic could affect behavior and health. We conducted a self-reported survey in northern Italy to observe the lockdown effects on lifestyle changes and to assess their determinants. Prevalence Odds Ratio and Prevalence Risk Ratio were determined. 490 adults (84% female) completed the survey: 13% and 43% reported improved and unchanged sleep quality, respectively, while 43% had insomnia symptoms. Among the 272 active subjects in pre-lockdown, 14% continued habitual exercising, 18% increased it and 68% reduced it; 27% of sedentary subjects started physical exercise; 34% reported an improvement in diet quality; 42% increased food intake and 13% decreased it; and 38% of the smokers increased cigarette consumption. Age and the pre-lockdown habit of regular physical exercising were the mainly determinants of lifestyle changes whereas BMI, gender, and the presence of chronic diseases did not. Living with other people increased the likelihood of increasing the food intake (<i>p</i> = 0.002). More than a third of people were able to positively reorganize their lives during the forced home confinement.

"Characterization of Home Working Population during COVID-19 Emergency: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","Evidence about the characterization of home workers in terms of both work-related outcomes and health issues is lacking. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to examine the impact of home working on perceived job productivity and satisfaction, work-related stress, and musculoskeletal (MSK) issues. We included 51 mobile workers, collecting data about demographic characteristics, working experience, job productivity, and stress. Job satisfaction was assessed through the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale (UWES), while MSK pain was investigated by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ). Moreover, a home workplace analysis had to be carried out according to current Italian regulations. Participants declared that they were less productive (39.2%) but less stressed (39.2%) and equally satisfied (51%) compared to the time of office working. Regarding MSK disorders, low back pain (LBP) was referred by 41.2% of home workers and neck pain by 23.5% of them. Neck pain worsened in 50% of home workers, while LBP did not exacerbate in 47.6% of cases. Home workers with MSK pain reported a lower job satisfaction. Depending on our data, the home environment seems to be not adequate in the mobile worker population, with an increased risk for mental health and MSK problems, particularly affecting the spine. Addressing these issues can significantly reduce risks for health, thus, improving job productivity and satisfaction and reducing cost.","Moretti, Menna, Aulicino, Paoletta, Liguori, Iolascon","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176284","20200904","COVID-19; home working; job satisfaction; low back pain; musculoskeletal pain; neck pain; occupational stress; smart working; work performance; workplace","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Health Behavior Changes During COVID-19 Pandemic and Subsequent &quot;Stay-at-Home&quot; Orders","The COVID-19 pandemic, and resultant &quot;Stay-at-Home&quot; orders, may have impacted adults' positive health behaviors (sleep, physical activity) and negative health behaviors (alcohol consumption, drug use, and tobacco use). The purpose of this study was to investigate how these health behaviors changed (increased/improved or decreased/worsened) at the early stages of the pandemic, what participant characteristics were associated with health behavior changes, and why these behavioral changes may have occurred. A convenience sample of 1809 adults residing in the United States completed a 15-min self-report questionnaire in April and May 2020. Multinomial logistic regressions and descriptive statistics were used to evaluate how, for whom, and why these health behaviors changed. Participants were primarily female (67.4%), aged 35-49 years (39.8%), college graduates (83.3%), non-tobacco users (74.7%), and had previously used marijuana (48.6%). Overall, participants primarily reported a decrease in physical activity, while sleep and all of the negative health behaviors remained the same. Changes in negative health behaviors were related (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) to sex, age, parental status, educational status, job status, BMI, and depression scores. Changes in positive health behaviors were related (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) to sex, parental status, job status, and depression scores.

"An Acute Manic Episode During 2019-nCoV Quarantine","The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.","Yin, Sun, Zhu, Zhu, Gou, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112","20200904","2019-nCoV; Manic episode; Quarantine; Reward hypersensitivity; Social zeitgebers; Stressful events","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological status of 8817 hospital workers during COVID-19 Epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Chongqing","There was an outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2019 in China, which spread all over the world rapidly. The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers (P&lt;0.05). This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected.

This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90Â s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90Â s (Î²Â =Â 0.908, PÂ =Â 0.016), the emotional reaction (Î²Â =Â 0.122, PÂ =Â 0.005) and physical reaction (Î²Â =Â 0.124, PÂ =Â 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression.

"Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak","Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and their correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. The overall prevalence of depression in 1103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68-46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and current smokers (OR=3.843, P&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower QOL compared to those without (F<sub>(1,1103)</sub>=423.83, P&lt;0.001). Depression was common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong","Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing are effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health have not been investigated. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I.Â =Â [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% (95% C.I.Â =Â [18.2%, 27.2%]) of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis risk.

"Drinking to Cope During COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of External and Internal Factors in Coping Motive Pathways to Alcohol Use, Solitary Drinking, and Alcohol Problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (NÂ =Â 320; 54.7% male; mean age of 32Â years) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30Â days, covering a time period beginning within 1Â month of the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that having at least 1 child under the age of 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use, and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and greater coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer term outcomes of drinking to cope during the pandemic.","Wardell, Kempe, Rapinda, Single, Bilevicius, Frohlich, Hendershot, Keough","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14425","20200901","Coronavirus; Drinking Motives; Social Distancing; Solitary Drinking; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Future perspective: high-throughput construction of new ultrasensitive cytokine and virion liquid chips for high-throughput screening (HTS) of anti-inflammatory drugs or clinical diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases","Pathogen-host cell interactions play an important role in many human infectious and inflammatory diseases. Several pathogens, including Escherichia coli (E. coli), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), and even the recent 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), can cause serious breathing and brain disorders, tissue injury and inflammation, leading to high rates of mortality and resulting in great loss to human physical and mental health as well as the global economy. These infectious diseases exploit the microbial and host factors to induce serious inflammatory and immunological symptoms. Thus the development of anti-inflammatory drugs targeting bacterial/viral infection is an urgent need. In previous studies, YojI-IFNAR2, YojI-IL10RA, YojI-NRP1,YojI-SIGLEC7, and YojI-MC4R membrane-protein interactions were found to mediate E. coli invasion of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which activated the downstream anti-inflammatory proteins NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 2(NLRP2), using a proteomic chip conjugated with cell immunofluorescence labeling. However, the studies of pathogen (bacteria/virus)-host cell interactions mediated by membrane protein interactions did not extend their principles to broad biomedical applications such as 2019-nCoV infectious disease therapy. The first part of this feature article presents in-depth analysis of the cross-talk of cellular anti-inflammatory transduction signaling among interferon membrane protein receptor II (IFNAR2), interleukin-10 receptor subunit alpha (IL-10RA), NLRP2 and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent phospholipase A2 (PLA2G5), based on experimental results and important published studies, which lays a theoretical foundation for the high-throughput construction of the cytokine and virion solution chip. The paper then moves on to the construction of the novel GPCR recombinant herpes virion chip and virion nano-oscillators for profiling membrane protein functions, which drove the idea of constructing the new recombinant virion and cytokine liquid chips for HTS of leading drugs. Due to the different structural properties of GPCR, IFNAR2, ACE2 and Spike of 2019-nCoV, their ligands will either bind the extracellular domain of IFNAR2/ACE2/Spike or the specific loops of the GPCR on the envelope of the recombinant herpes virions to induce dynamic charge distribution changes that lead to the variable electron transition for detection. Taken together, the combined overview of two of the most innovative and exciting developments in the immunoinflammatory field provides new insight into high-throughput construction of ultrasensitive cytokine and virion liquid chips for HTS of anti-inflammatory drugs or clinical diagnosis and treatment of inflammatory diseases including infectious diseases, acute or chronic inflammation (acute gouty arthritis or rheumatoid arthritis), cardiovascular disease, atheromatosis, diabetes, obesity, tissue injury and tumors. It has significant value in the prevention and treatment of these serious and painful diseases.

"Are older adults also at higher psychological risk from COVID-19?","Given the lack of information on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on people aged â‰¥60, we aimed to describe their psychological responses to this pandemic and lockdown situation and compare them with those under 60â€‰years of age. Secondary analysis of a larger online cross-sectional study designed to determine the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown across Spain. We analyzed a total of 1690 respondents aged â‰¥60â€‰years and compared them with 13,363 respondents under 60â€‰years of age. We employed the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale and the Impact of Event Scale to evaluate psychological responses. In all, 52.6% of women and 34.3% of men were found to be probable cases of any emotional distress (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). In both sexes, the most common psychological response was avoidance behavior (34.7% and 23.8%, respectively), followed by depression (28.5 and 14.2%). Older women and men were considered probable cases of any emotional distress less often than younger ones (women: 52.6% vs. 72.3%, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001; men: 34.3% vs. 50.6%, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Finally, the results of the binary logistic regression showed that only depressive and stress responses are psychological factors associated with age group [age â‰¥ 60â€‰years, O.R. = 0.617 (95% CI = 0.501â€‰-â€‰0.759) and 0.437 (95% CI = 0.334â€‰-â€‰0.573), respectively]. Contrary to our hypothesis and despite the high percentage of emotional distress we found in older adults, especially women, they are actually at lower risk of developing depressive and stress consequences from COVID-19 and lockdown than those under 60â€‰years of age.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Emotional Resilience and Learning Management of Middle School Students","BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to explore the emotional resilience of middle school students learning at home in February and March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of this resilience on students' learning management skills. The results could provide a basis for psychological health education of middle school students during major life events. MATERIAL AND METHODS This study used a survey to explore emotional resilience and learning management abilities in middle school students (N=896) from February 10, 2020, to March 22, 2020. Students used online e-learning during this period due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were analyzed using t-testing, Pearson's correlation, and multivariate linear regression. RESULTS The results indicate that emotional resilience was significantly lower in eighth grade students than in seventh grade students (t=1.98, P&lt;0.05) and negative emotional recovery increased during the study period. Emotional resilience was positively correlated with learning management skills (r=0.498, P&lt;0.01), and positive emotional ability predicted learning management skills. CONCLUSIONS The study findings indicate that in the face of major life events, emotional resilience is an important factor for the mental health of adolescents and improves coping ability. Cultivating positive emotions can improve learning efficiency.","Zhang, Zhou, Xia","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.924994","20200901",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

A nationwide cross-sectional survey of the prevalence of mental disorders was conducted. We used Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to estimate the prevalence of anxiety and depression. The internal paths and the causality of the psychological health were analyzed using a structural equation modeling (SEM) approach. A total of 24,789 respondents completed the survey. We found that the overall prevalence of anxiety, depression, combination of anxiety, and depression were 51.6% (95% CI: 51.0-52.2), 47.5% (95% CI: 46.9-48.1), and 24.5% (95% CI: 24.0-25.0), respectively. The risk of psychological disorders in men was higher than that in women. The status of psychological health was different across different age groups, education levels, occupations, and income levels. The SEM analysis revealed that inadequate material supplies, low income, low education, lack of knowledge or confidence of the epidemic, and lack of exercise are major risk factors for psychological distress. The evidence from this survey poses serious challenges related to the high prevalence of psychological distress, but also offers strategies to deal with the mental health problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wu, Han, Lin, Chen, Wu, Du, Su, Wu, Chen, Zhang, Zhou, Huang, Wu, Wu, Lai","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1818","20200901","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; psychological distress; structural equation modeling","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal health services in Pakistan","Throughout the world as health systems are being prepared to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak which will affect the management of HIV, diabetes, mental health and mainly maternal healthcare systems. As all efforts are focused on understanding the epidemiology, clinical features, transmission patterns, and management of the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been very little concern expressed over the effects on maternal health services. It is highly likely that the present situation may exacerbate maternal mortality in suburban and rural areas.

"The Coronavirus Health and Impact Survey (CRISIS) reveals reproducible correlates of pandemic-related mood states across the Atlantic","The COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic consequences have had adverse impacts on physical and mental health worldwide and exposed all segments of the population to protracted uncertainty and daily disruptions. The CoRonavIruS health and Impact Survey (CRISIS) was developed for use as an easy to implement and robust questionnaire covering key domains relevant to mental distress and resilience during the pandemic. In the current work, we demonstrate the feasibility, psychometric structure and construct validity of this survey. We then show that pre-existing mood states, perceived COVID risk, and lifestyle changes are strongly associated with negative mood states during the pandemic in population samples of adults and in parents reporting on their children in the US and UK. Ongoing studies using CRISIS include international studies of COVID-related ill health conducted during different phases of the pandemic and follow-up studies of cohorts characterized before the COVID pandemic.","Nikolaidis, Paksarian, Alexander, DeRosa, Dunn, Nielson, Droney, Kang, Douka, Bromet, Milham, Stringaris, Merikangas","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.24.20181123","20200901",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Health-related quality of life and behavior-related lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 home confinement: dataset from a Moroccan sample","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has caused a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1]. The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths. Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities' restrictions could impact the citizens' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation. The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle.","Azizi, Achak, Aboudi, Saad, Nejjari, Nouira, Hilali, Youlyouz-Marfak, Marfak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106239","20200901","ARI, Absolute Risk Increase; ARR, Absolute Risk Reduction; Behavior-related lifestyle; COVID-19 pandemic; EQ-5D-5L; HRQoL, Health-Related Quality of Life; Health-related quality of life; Home confinement","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 in adult patients with pre-existing chronic cardiac, respiratory and metabolic disease: a critical literature review with clinical recommendations","A high burden of severe disease and death from the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been consistently observed in older patients, especially those with pre-existing medical co-morbidities. The global pandemic lockdown has isolated many patients with chronic illnesses from their routine medical care. This narrative review article analyses the multitude of issues faced by individuals with underlying medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources for this publication were identified through searches of PubMed for articles published between 31st December 2019 and 4th June 2020, using combinations of search terms. Guidelines and updates from reputable agencies were also consulted. Only articles published in the English language were included. The volume of literature on COVID-19 continues to expand, with 17,845 articles indexed on PubMed by 4th June 2020, 130 of which were deemed particularly relevant to the subject matter of this review. Older patients are more likely to progress to severe COVID-19 disease requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, especially hypertension and coronary heart disease, are at greatly increased risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19 disease. A controversial aspect of the management of COVID-19 disease has been the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. Obese COVID-19 patients are more likely to require complex ICU management. Putative mechanisms of increased COVID-19 disease severity in diabetes include hyperglycaemia, altered immune function, sub-optimal glycaemic control during hospitalisation, a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory state. Patients with mental health disorders are particularly vulnerable to social isolation, and this has been compounded by the suspension of non-emergency care in hospitals around the world, making it difficult for patients with chronic mental illness to attend outpatient appointments. The global pandemic of COVID-19 disease has had a disproportionately negative impact on patients living with chronic medical illness. Future research should be directed at efforts to protect vulnerable patients from possible further waves of COVID-19 and minimising the negative impact of pandemic mitigation strategies on these individuals.","Flaherty, Hession, Liew, Lim, Leong, Lim, Sulaiman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40794-020-00118-y","20200902","COVID-19; Chronic illness; Co-morbidities; Novel coronavirus; Pandemic; SARS-CoV-2; Travel","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Early Effects of COVID-19 on Programs Providing Medications for Opioid Use Disorder in Jails and Prisons","To describe how the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has affected opioid agonist treatment (OAT) programs in jails and prisons. In May 2020, we conducted an online survey of 19 carceral systems that provided methadone and/or buprenorphine treatment for incarcerated populations before COVID-19. Eleven survey items examined challenges and changes to these programs as a result of the pandemic. Sixteen of 19 programs (84%) responded to the survey. Ten out of 16 systems reported downsizing their OAT programs. Seven of 16 systems made changes to medication dispensation processes. Half of systems report challenges implementing physical distancing (nâ€Š=â€Š8), and/or obtaining personal protective equipment (nâ€Š=â€Š8). In 13 out of 16 systems some OAT program participants were released early due to COVID-19 infection risk. Jails and prisons with existing OAT programs have curtailed their operations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the robust evidence base around OAT for treating opioid use disorder and averting overdose deaths, guidance is needed on maintaining and ramping up medication access as carceral facilities grapple with implementing COVID-19 mitigation.","Bandara, Kennedy-Hendricks, Merritt, Barry, Saloner","https://doi.org/10.1097/ADM.0000000000000718","20200901",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Emerging of a SARS-CoV-2 viral strain with a deletion in nsp1","The new Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in Wuhan (China) in December of 2019 is responsible for the current global pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that it is similar to other betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and Middle-Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, MERS-CoV. Its genome isâ€‰âˆ¼â€‰30Â kb in length and contains two large overlapping polyproteins, ORF1a and ORF1ab that encode for several structural and non-structural proteins. The non-structural protein 1 (nsp1) is arguably the most important pathogenic determinant, and previous studies on SARS-CoV indicate that it is both involved in viral replication and hampering the innate immune system response. Detailed experiments of site-specific mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution studies determined that the mechanisms of action are mediated by (a) the presence of specific amino acid residues of nsp1 and (b) the interaction between the protein and the host's small ribosomal unit. In fact, substitution of certain amino acids resulted in reduction of its negative effects. A total of 17,928 genome sequences were obtained from the GISAID database (December 2019 to July 2020) from patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 from different areas around the world. Genomes alignment was performed using MAFFT (REFF) and the nsp1 genomic regions were identified using BioEdit and verified using BLAST. Nsp1 protein of SARS-CoV-2 with and without deletion have been subsequently modelled using I-TASSER. We identified SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, from several Countries, carrying a previously unknown deletion of 9 nucleotides in position 686-694, corresponding to the AA position 241-243 (KSF). This deletion was found in different geographical areas. Structural prediction modelling suggests an effect on the C-terminal tail structure. Modelling analysis of a newly identified deletion of 3 amino acids (KSF) of SARS-CoV-2 nsp1 suggests that this deletion could affect the structure of the C-terminal region of the protein, important for regulation of viral replication and negative effect on host's gene expression. In addition, substitution of the two amino acids (KS) from nsp1 of SARS-CoV was previously reported to revert loss of interferon-alpha expression. The deletion that we describe indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing profound genomic changes. It is important to: (i) confirm the spreading of this particular viral strain, and potentially of strains with other deletions in the nsp1 protein, both in the population of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic subjects, and (ii) correlate these changes in nsp1 with potential decreased viral pathogenicity.","Benedetti, Snyder, Giovanetti, Angeletti, Gallo, Ciccozzi, Zella","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12967-020-02507-5","20200903","COVID-19; Deletion; Pathogenic; SARS-CoV-2; Viral adaptation; nsp1","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Development and Implementation of Societal Influences Survey Questionnaire (SISQ) for Peoples during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Validity and Reliability Analysis","The emergence of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) had rapidly spread since FEB/MAR 2020. Policy to prevent transmission of COVDI-19 resulted in multi-dimensional impact on social interaction. We aimed to develop a beneficial survey tool with favorable quality and availability, the Societal Influences Survey Questionnaire (SISQ), to evaluate social influences on people during this pandemic. The SISQ was developed with 15 items and 4-point Likert scales consisting of five factors. These include social distance, social anxiety, social desirability, social information, and social adaptation. Construct validity and reliability were performed to verify the SISQ. A total of 1912 Taiwanese were recruited. The results demonstrated that the SISQ has acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's alphas ranging between 0.57 and 0.76. The SISQ accounted for 58.86% and satisfied the requirement of Kaiser-Mayer-Olkinvalues (0.78) and significant Bartlett's Test of sphericity. Moreover, the confirmatory factor analysis fit indices also indicated the adequacy of the model. As for multiple comparison, females scored higher than males in factor of social distance. Unemployed participants and those without partners scored higher in several domains of factors. The survey method and survey instrument prove reliable and valuable, also providing different categories of assessment results regarding social influences and their impacts. Further studies are warranted to extend the applicability of SISQ.","Li, Kao, Shieh, Chou, Lo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176246","20200902","COVID-19; mental health; reliability; social influences; validity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How Personality Relates to Distress in Parents during the Covid-19 Lockdown: The Mediating Role of Child's Emotional and Behavioral Difficulties and the Moderating Effect of Living with Other People","Since the initiation of the COVID-19 lockdown, Italian parents have been forced to manage their children at home. The present study aimed at investigating the psychological distress of parents during the lockdown, identifying contributing factors. An online survey was administered to 833 participants from 3 to 15 April 2020. Mediation and moderated mediation models were run to explore the association between parent neuroticism and parent distress, mediated by child hyperactivity-inattention and child emotional symptoms, and the moderating effect of living only with child(ren) on the direct and indirect effects of parent neuroticism on parent distress. For parents living only with child(ren), high levels of psychological distress depended exclusively on their levels of neuroticism. For parents living with at least one other person in addition to child(ren), distress levels were also mediated by child behavioral and emotional difficulties. Motherhood emerged as a significant factor contributing to greater distress. Furthermore, parent psychological distress decreased in line with increased child age. The results confirm that neuroticism is an important risk factor for mental health. Preventive measures should be primarily target multicomponent families with younger children and directed towards parents who are already known to present emotional instability and to parents of children who have received local mental health assistance for behavioral and/or emotional difficulties.","Mazza, Ricci, Marchetti, Fontanesi, Di Giandomenico, Verrocchio, Roma","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176236","20200902","BIF-10; GHQ-12; SDQ-P; distress; emotional stability; hyperactivityâ€“inattention; mental health; neuroticism; parenting","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of infertile couples","to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertile couples' emotions, anxiety and future plans. An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4 Â± 16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8 Â± 15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI &gt; 36 of 71 %. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3 Â± 15.3. Women were more emotionally distressed, anxious and depressed than men (36.8 Â± 16.4 vs 31.0 Â± 18.4 for IES-R, respectively; p = 0.03). Notwithstanding the uncertainty about pregnancy safety, 64.6 % of respondents chose to maintain their reproductive programme. Economic crisis induced 11.5 % of the surveyed patients to give up their ART program. Respondents who had at least one relative affected by COVID-19 had a significantly higher IES-R score and anxiety VAS, but not higher STAI scores, than patients belonging to unaffected families. COVID-19 pandemic itself and the recommendation to stop ART program generated higher distress levels in infertile couples. The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in infertility patients should not be underestimated, and a specific psychological support should be planned.","Esposito, Rania, Lico, Pedri, Fiorenza, Strati, Conforti, Marrone, Carosso, Revelli, Zullo, Di Carlo, Venturella","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.08.025","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Distress; Infertility; Pandemic; Psychological impact","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE) guidelines and recommendations on gynecological endoscopy during the evolutionary phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has raised some important interrogations on minimally invasive gynaecological surgery. The International Society for Gynecologic Endoscopy (ISGE) has taken upon itself the task of providing guidance and best practice policies for all practicing gynaecological endoscopists. Factors affecting decision making processes in minimal invasive surgery (MIS) vary depending on factors such as the phase of the pandemic, policies on control and prevention, expertise and existing infrastructure. Our responsibility remains ensuring the safety of all health care providers, ancillary staff and patients during this unusual period. We reviewed the current literature related to gynecological and endoscopic surgery during the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) crisis. Regarding elective surgery, universal testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection should be carried out wherever possible 40 h prior to surgery. In case of confirmed positive case of SARS-CoV-2, surgery should be delayed. Priority should be given to relatively urgent cases such as malignancies. ISGE supports medical optimization and delaying surgery for benign non-life-threatening surgeries. When possible, we recommend to perform cases by laparoscopy and to allow early discharges. Any procedure with risk of bowel involvement should be performed by open surgery as studies have found a high amount of viral RNA (ribonucleic acid) in stool. Regarding urgent surgery, each unit should create a risk assessment flow chart based on capacity. Patients should be screened for symptoms and symptomatic patients must be tested. In the event that a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 is found, every attempt should be made to optimize medical management and defer surgery until the patient has recovered and only emergency or life-threatening surgery should be performed in these cases. We recommend to avoid intubation and ventilation in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and if at all possible local or regional anesthesia should be utilized. Patients who screen or test negative may have general anesthesia and laparoscopic surgery while strict protocols of infection control are upheld. Surgery in screen-positive as well as SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that cannot be safely postponed should be undertaken with full PPE with ensuring that only essential personnel are exposed. If available, negative pressure theatres should be used for patients who are positive or screen high risk. During open and vaginal procedures, suction can be used to minimize droplet and bioaerosol spread. In a patient who screens low risk or tests negative, although carrier and false negatives cannot be excluded, laparoscopy should be strongly considered. We recommend, during minimal access surgeries, to use strategies to reduce production of bioaerosols (such as minimal use of energy, experienced surgeon), to reduce leakage of smoke aerosols (for example, minimizing the number of ports used and size of incisions, as well as reducing the operating pressures) and to promote safe elimination of smoke during surgery and during the ports' closure (such as using gas filters and smoke evacuation systems). During the post-peak period of pandemic, debriefing and mental health screening for staff is recommended. Psychological support should be provided as needed. In conclusion, based on the existent evidence, ISGE largely supports the current international trends favoring laparoscopy over laparotomy on a case by case risk evaluation basis, recognizing the different levels of skill and access to minimally invasive procedures across various countries.","Thomas, Maillard, Barnard, Snyman, Chrysostomou, Shimange-Matsose, Van Herendael","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.08.039","20200903","Guidelines; Gynecology; Hysteroscopy; Laparoscopy; Minimally invasive surgery; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The mental state and risk factors of Chinese medical staff and medical students in early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic","This study aimed to investigate the mental state of medical staff and medical students in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, as well as analyze the risk factors of serious mental illness (SMI), so as to provide a scientific basis for further psychological intervention and management. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from February 2-7, 2020. The Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale and a general information questionnaire were administered on-line to a convenience sample of 548 medical staff and medical students in China. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to screen the risk factors of SMI in medical staff and medical students. Of the 505 respondents in the final analysis, 188 (37.23%) were at high risk of SMI. Respondents were at significantly higher risk of SMI if they had been suspected of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (ORÂ =Â 7.00, 95% CI: 1.19-41.14), had relatives suspected of being infected with the SARS-CoV-2 (ORÂ =Â 23.60, 95% CI: 1.11-501.30), felt concerned towards media coverage of outbreak-related information (ORÂ =Â 11.95, 95% CI: 3.07-46.57), recently dreamed related to SARS-CoV-2 (ORÂ =Â 4.21, 95% CI: 2.22-8.01), experienced difficulty in controlling emotions during SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (ORÂ =Â 3.25, 95% CI: 1.66-6.37), or spent hours watching outbreaks per day (ORÂ =Â 1.29, 95% CI: 1.13-1.46). Our findings highlight that medical staff and medical students were vulnerable to SMI during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and identify the factors associated with SMI which can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health. The independent risk factors for SMI among them are suspicion that they or relatives were infected with the SARS-CoV-2, greater interest in media reports about the epidemic, frequency of recent dreams related to SARS-CoV-2, difficulty in controlling emotions during the epidemic, and hours spent watching outbreaks per day.","Wu, Li, Li, Xiang, Yuan, Liu, Xiong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152202","20200903","COVID-19; Medical staff; Medical students; SARS-CoV-2; Serious Mental Illness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Reopening K-12 Schools in the Era of COVID-19: Review of State-level Guidance Addressing Equity Concerns","To determine how state guidance documents address equity concerns in K-12 schools during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using online searches, we collected state-level documents from all 50 states and the District of Columbia discussing reopening plans for K-12 schools in the 2020-2021 academic year. We examined whether these documents explicitly mentioned equity as a concern, as well as if and how they addressed the following equity issues: food insecurity and child nutrition, homelessness or temporary housing, lack of access to Internet/technology, students with disabilities or special needs, English language learners, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) or an equivalent agency, mental health support, students/staff at higher risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and students/staff living with someone at higher risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Forty-four of 51 states (86%) explicitly mentioned equity as a concern or guiding principle. At least 90% of states offered guidance for 7 equity issues. Fewer than 75% states addressed homelessness or temporary housing, students involved with or on the verge of involvement with DCFS or an equivalent agency, and students/staff living with someone at higher risk of severe illness from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Wide variability exists in state-level guidance to help K-12 schools develop re-opening plans that protect those who are most vulnerable to learning loss or reduced access to basic needs. Interpretation and implementation by local educational agencies will need to be assessed.","Li, Harries, Ross","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.08.069","20200903","COVID-19; equity; pandemic; schools; states","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Symptoms of Anxiety, Depression and Peritraumatic Dissociation in Critical Care Clinicians Managing COVID-19 Patients: A Cross-Sectional Study","Frontline healthcare providers (HCPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic are at high risk of mental morbidity. To assess the prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation in HCPs. Cross-sectional study in 21 ICUs in France between April 20 and May 21, 2020. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Peritraumatic Dissociative Experience Questionnaire were used. Factors independently associated with reported symptoms of mental health disorders were identified. Response rate was 67%, with 1058 respondents (median age 33 y, 71% women, 68% nursing staff). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation was 50.4%, 30.4%, and 32%, respectively, with the highest rates in nurses. By multivariable analysis, male sex was independently associated with lower prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic dissociation (Odds Ratio of 0.58(0.42-0.79), 0.57(0.39-0.82) and 0.49(0.34-0.72), respectively. HCPs working in non-university-affiliated hospitals and nursing assistants were at high risk of symptoms of anxiety and peritraumatic dissociation. Importantly, we identified six modifiable determinants of symptoms of mental health disorders: fear of being infected, inability to rest, inability to care for family, struggling with difficult emotions, regret about the restrictions in visitation policies, and witnessing hasty end-of-life decisions. HCPs experience high levels of psychological burden during the COVID-19 epidemic. Hospitals, ICU directors, and ICU staff must devise strategies to overcome the modifiable determinants of adverse mental illness symptoms.

An anonymous survey was distributed to physician members of the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) on March 24 and April 7, 2020. Respondents provided information regarding changes in clinical volume, treatment, and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-4]) before April 10, 2020. Of the 1,430 individuals who opened the survey, 260 completed it (18.2%). Overall clinical and procedural volume decreased to 69.6% and 13.0% of prepandemic volume, respectively. Mean in-person clinic visits were reduced to 17.7% of total prepandemic clinic volume. Ongoing clinical visits were predominantly completed via telemedicine (video) or telephone (74.5%), rather than in-person (25.5%). Telemedicine and telephone visits represented 24.6% and 27.3% of prepandemic clinical volume, respectively. Respondents decreased in-person visits of select groups of high-risk patients by 85.8-94.6%. Significantly more providers reported increasing rather than decreasing prescriptions of the following medications: opioids (28.8% vs 6.2% of providers, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), muscle relaxants (22.3% vs 5.4%, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), neuropathic pain medications (29.6% vs 3.8%, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001), and acetaminophen (26.2% vs 4.2%, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Respondents' mean PHQ-4 score was 3.1, with 19% reporting moderate or severe psychological distress. Several demographic factors were significantly associated with practice changes. The novel coronavirus pandemic dramatically altered the practice and prescribing patterns of interventional pain physicians.","Joyce, Conger, McCormick, Kendall, Wagner, Teramoto, Cushman","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa294","20200831","COVID; Coronavirus; Opioids; Pain; Pandemic; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Implication of coronavirus pandemic on obsessive-compulsive-disorder symptoms","This review assesses various sources regarding obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms and the coronavirus pandemic via a study of literature related to OCD conditions in the United States, China, the United Kingdom, and India. Coronavirus's morbidity and its status as a global pandemic transmittable from one person to another has subsequently intensified the personal perception of distress. The projected shortage of vital medical equipment to fight coronavirus due to daily increases in COVID-19 cases creates social unrest. The world confronts perpetual news about high numbers of coronavirus cases, more people in quarantine, and more deaths; those not infected feel increasing fear about its proximity. Social media, print media, and electronic sources offer much advice on how to prevent coronavirus infection. Pandemics extend beyond pathophysiology and medical phenomena to associations with intense psychosocial impact. Studies have established that people with existing mental disorders are prone to relapses, the fear of faulty COVID-19 prevention measures, distress, and suicidal thoughts during pandemics. Precautionary measures aim to slow the spread of coronavirus, but these radical repetitive measures create great anxiety in the mental health of individuals suffering from OCD. Despite the nature of their conditions, these people must adhere to routine processes, such as washing hands, wearing masks and gloves, and sanitizing hands. Given the asymptomatic nature of people suffering from OCD, the routine measures for addressing COVID-19 have a hectic and adverse effect on their mental health and their state of relaxation. Through a systematic literature review, this paper provides insight into the coronavirus pandemic's implications for OCD symptoms.","Sulaimani, Bagadood","https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2020-0054","20200831","COVID-19; coronavirus; distress; mental health; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Replication analysis of the COVID-19 Worry Scale","Efforts and focus regarding the COVID-19 pandemic have largely been centered around physical health. However, mental health is equally as critical-as such, psychological impacts can resonate adversely during and following the pandemic. This study examined a sample of 729 Bangladeshi people and aimed to assess the psychological impact of the pandemic. Through this replication analysis, the results supported the validation and reliability of the COVID-19 Worry Scale on a Bangladeshi population. The validation of another COVID-19 mental health measure can help determine who is mentally affected by the pandemic and the extent of COVID-19's psychological impact.","Faisal, Jobe, Ahmed, Sharker","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2020.1815104","20200831",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Best Practices for Approaching Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents major challenges for mental health care providers. In particular, providers who treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are now tasked with determining whether to initiate trauma-focused therapy during the pandemic and, if so, whether and how to adapt treatment. The purpose of this communication is to identify and organize key considerations for whether and how to deliver commonly used evidence-supported therapy protocols for trauma treatment-specifically, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy-during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic for adults who currently meet the criteria for PTSD. Based on relevant public health and clinical literature, we present a structured guide that can be used by treatment teams and individual providers to evaluate whether initiating CPT or PE is indicated given a particular patient-provider pair and system context amidst pandemic conditions. In addition, we suggest appropriate action steps, including problem-solving strategies, evidence-informed modifications to CPT and PE, and alternative intervention approaches.","Hagerty, Wielgosz, Kraemer, Nguyen, Loew, Kaysen","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22583","20200831",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental Health Burden of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Germany: Predictors of Mental Health Impairment","COVID-19 is causing an enormous psychological burden for most people. This study aims to assess individual changes in mental health and health status before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore potential predictors of change. A cross-sectional study in Germany (n = 15â€‰037) were conducted. Demographics, depression and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-2, GAD-2), distress (DT), and health status (EQ-5D-3L) were assessed. Additionally, all instruments used were adapted to measure the participants' mental health and health status before the COVID-19 outbreak. COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, and the subjective level of information about COVID-19 were examined. Overall, the participants showed a significant increase in depression and anxiety symptoms, and distress, while health status deteriorated since the COVID-19 outbreak. Impairment in mental health was predicted by COVID-19-related fear. Pre-existing mental illness predicted an increase in depression symptoms and a deterioration in health status. Trust in governmental actions and the subjective level of information predicted less increase in psychological burden. Our data revealed that there have been changes in mental health and health status at an individual level since the outbreak of COVID-19. In order to maintain mental health, the observed predictors should be addressed.","BÃ¤uerle, Steinbach, Schweda, Beckord, Hetkamp, WeismÃ¼ller, Kohler, Musche, DÃ¶rrie, Teufel, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720953682","20200903","COVID-19; anxiety; changes in mental health; depression; mental health; predictors of change; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Fear; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Time from COVID-19 shutdown, gender-based violence exposure, and mental health outcomes among a state representative sample of California residents","There is increasing evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant shutdowns on mental health. This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted <i>N</i>Â =Â 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. Nearly one in five (19â€¢7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15â€¢5% had a history of IPV and 10â€¢1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

"Managing the COVID-19 Pandemic: Research Strategies Based on the Evolutionary and Molecular Characteristics of Coronaviruses","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an ongoing global health emergency, is a highly transmittable and pathogenic viral infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Emerging in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it spread widely across the world causing panic-worst ever economic depression is visibly predictable. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have emerged as a major public health concern having caused three zoonotic outbreaks; severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) in 2002-2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) in 2012, and currently this devastating COVID-19. Research strategies focused on understanding the evolutionary origin, transmission, and molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 and its pathogenesis need to be urgently formulated to manage the current and possible future coronaviral outbreaks. Current response to the COVID-19 outbreak has been largely limited to monitoring/containment.

"Lessons Learned in Implementing VA Video Connect for Evidence-Based Psychotherapies for Anxiety and Depression in the Veterans Healthcare Administration","A top priority for the Veteran's Healthcare Administration is improving access to high-quality mental healthcare. Mobile and telemental healthcare are a vital component of increasing access for veterans. The Veteran's Healthcare Administration is making efforts to further broaden how veterans receive their care through VA Video Connect, which allows veterans to connect with their provider from their residence or workplace. In this mixed-methods study, successes and challenges associated with the rapid implementation of VA Video Connect telemental health appointments are examined through (1) administrative data and (2) qualitative interviews at one medical center. Within 1Â year of the telehealth initiative, the number of providers experienced with telemental health increased from 15% to 85%, and telehealth appointments increased from 5376 to 14,210. Provider reported barriers included administrative challenges and concerns regarding care. Having an implementation model of telehealth champions and a team of experienced mental health providers allowed for rapid adoption of telehealth. Utilizing a similar model in other settings will further enable more veterans with depression and anxiety to have access to evidence-based psychotherapy, regardless of location or national crisis. With the dramatic increase in both training for providers as well as veteran use of telemental healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic response, future research should aim to better understand which teams were able to switch to telehealth easily versus those which struggled, along with examining system-wide and provider-level factors that facilitated continued use of telehealth after social distancing requirements related to COVID-19 were relaxed.","Myers, Coulon, Knies, Dickens, Keller, Birks, Grubaugh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41347-020-00161-8","20200902","Access to care; Mental health; Technology; Telehealth; Veteran","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A study on variation of atmospheric pollutants over Bhubaneswar during imposition of nationwide lockdown in India for the COVID-19 pandemic","The nationwide lockdown in India to flatten the pandemic COVID-19 curve has resulted in the reduction of anthropogenic emission sources to a great extent. This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NO<sub>x</sub> (~ 67 %) and BC (~ 47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~ 14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O<sub>3</sub> (~ 3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>x</sub> during pre-lockdown points to a higher O<sub>3</sub> production potential with decreasing NO<sub>x</sub>. While a reduction in the titration of O<sub>3</sub> due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O<sub>3</sub> in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O<sub>3</sub> values during the later phases of lockdown.","Panda, Mallik, Nath, Das, Ramasamy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11869-020-00916-5","20200902","Air quality; BC; CO; Lockdown; NOx; O3","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Personality and perceived stress during COVID-19 pandemic: Testing the mediating role of perceived threat and efficacy","Prolonged stress is associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes. Understanding the mediators between personality and stress is critical for developing effective stress management interventions during a pandemic. Our study explored whether perceptions of threat from COVID-19 and efficacy to follow government recommendations for preventing COVID-19 would mediate the relationships between personality traits (e.g., neuroticism, conscientiousness-goal-striving, extroversion-activity and sociability) and perceived stress. In an online survey of a representative sample of Canadian adults (<i>n</i>Â =Â 1055), we found that higher neuroticism and extroversion were associated with higher levels of stress during the pandemic and a greater increase in stress levels compared to levels before the pandemic. Perceived threat and efficacy significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism and stress, which suggested that individuals with higher neuroticism experienced higher levels of stress due to higher levels of perceived threat and lower levels of efficacy. Perceived threat did not mediate the relationship between extroverts and stress, which suggested that the source of stress may stem from elsewhere (e.g., inability to socialize). Our findings highlighted that personality traits could be an important factor in identifying stress-prone individuals during a pandemic and that stress management interventions need to be personality specific.","Liu, Lithopoulos, Zhang, Garcia-Barrera, Rhodes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110351","20200901","COVID-19; Perceived efficacy; Perceived threat; Personality; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental distress in orthodontic patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts the mental health of patients, health workers, and the public. The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. AnÂ online survey was conducted on a convenience sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1-3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed mental health-related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 Mental Distress Scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principal component analysis, K-means cluster analysis, and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with significance set at PÂ &lt;0.05. Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; mean age 24.78Â Â±Â 6.33Â years). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments, and Hubei residence. The type of orthodontic appliance was associated with the anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concerns of prolonged treatment duration. The frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. Over one-third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, time since last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Wu, Fang, Sun, Ding, Yi, Huang, Gong, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.07.005","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What COVID-19 can mean for people with hemophilia beyond the infection risk","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents an unprecedented global health crisis. To combat its effects, many governments have opted for strategies of social isolation that involve a radical change in people's behavior. For patients with hemophilia, the negative consequences of these measures can be greater, given they modify aspects of health care and lifestyles needed to counteract the adverse effects of hemophilia. The long-term consequences of the pandemic on patients with hemophilia are not well known. The aim of this special report is to show what COVID-19 could mean for this population, beyond the risk of infection.

"Effects of general and sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors on the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people in Hong Kong","The impact of COVID-19 on mental health has begun to be widely recognized, but there is an absence of studies on how the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.","Suen, Chan, Wong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365","20200903","COVID-19; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; sexual minorities","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Sleep quality and mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Morocco","The lockdown of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoples' sleep quality and mental health. We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.","Janati Idrissi, Lamkaddem, Benouajjit, Ben El Bouaazzaoui, El Houari, Alami, Labyad, Chahidi, Benjelloun, Rabhi, Kissani, Zarhbouch, Ouazzani, Kadiri, Alouane, Elbiaze, Boujraf, El Fakir, Souirti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Insomnia; Mental health; Morocco; Sleep knowledge; Sleep quality","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies' mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors' abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p&lt;0.05). An English online survey was used. During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact.

"Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis","This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.","Serrano-Ripoll, Meneses-Echavez, Ricci-Cabello, Fraile-Navarro, Fiol-deRoque, Pastor-Moreno, Castro, Ruiz-PÃ©rez, Zamanillo Campos, GonÃ§alves-Bradley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034","20200903","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Viral pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: Effects of stay-at-home policies, social distancing behavior, and social resources","Social distancing is the most visible public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but its implications for mental health are unknown. In a nationwide online sample of 435Â U.S. adults, conducted in March 2020 as the pandemic accelerated and states implemented stay-at-home orders, we examined whether stay-at-home orders and individuals' personal distancing behavior were associated with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), intrusive thoughts, insomnia, and acute stress. Stay-at-home order status and personal distancing were independently associated with higher symptoms, beyond protective effects of available social resources (social support and social network size). A subsample of 118 participants who had completed symptom measures earlier in the outbreak (February 2020) showed increases in depression and GAD between February and March, and personal distancing behavior was associated with these increases. Findings suggest that there are negative mental health correlates of social distancing, which should be addressed in research, policy, and clinical approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic.","MarroquÃ­n, Vine, Morgan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113419","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Mental health; Social distancing; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general Chinese population: Changes, predictors and psychosocial correlates","The current COVID-19 pandemic is not only a threat to physical health, but also brings a burden to mental health in the general Chinese population. However, the temporal change of mental health status due to pandemic-related stress in relation to protective and risk factors to hostility is less known. This study was implemented at two timepoints, i.e., during the peak and the remission of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3233 Chinese individuals participated in the first wave, and among them 1390 participants were followed in a second wave. The result showed that fear significantly decreased over time, while depression level significantly increased during the second wave compared to the first wave of the survey. Younger age, lower-income, increased level of perceived stress, and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of depression escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a higher initial stress response tended to show more hostility. Furthermore, the use of negative coping strategy plays a potential intermediating role in the stress-related increase in hostility, while social support acts as a buffer in hostility in the general population under high stress. As the whole world is facing the same pandemic, this research provides several implications for public mental health intervention.","Duan, Yan, Ding, Gan, Kohn, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113396","20200903","COVID-19; Coping; Depression; Hostility; Mental health; Social support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Sleep disturbances among Chinese residents during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak and associated factors","Sleep status can affect the body's immune status and mental health. This study aims to investigate the sleep status of Chinese residents during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to evaluate its related risk factors. This research carried out a cross-sectional survey in February 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) to investigate the sleep status of residents nationwide in the form of an online questionnaire. Of the 8151 respondents, 6437 were eventually included in the analysis. Logistic regression is applied to analyze the associated factors affecting residents' sleep quality. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of sleep disturbances in residents was 17.65%. Increased risk of sleep disturbances was found to be associated with older age, female gender, and poor self-reported health status. Moreover, the odds ratios (ORs) were 1.42 (95% CI: 1.1-2.64), 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16-1.59), 5.59 (95% CI: 4.32-7.23), respectively. Those residents who believed COVID-19 had caused a high number of deaths or who thought COVID-19 was not easy to cure were more likely to experience sleep disorders, and the ORs were 1.73 (95% CI: 1.43-2.09), 1.57 (95% CI: 1.29-1.91), respectively. Regular exercise was a protective factor for sleep disturbances, ORÂ =Â 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63-0.93). During the outbreak of COVID-19, nearly one-fifth of participants had sleep disorders. It is necessary to pay more attention to people at high risk for sleep disturbances during the outbreak, adopt effective risk communication methods, enhance residents' rational understanding of COVID-19, and develop practical indoor exercise programs for general public to improve sleep quality.","Wang, Gong, Chen, Wu, Feng, Yan, Lv, Lu, Mu, Yin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.08.002","20200903","Associated factors; COVID-19; Chinese residents; Sleep disturbances","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Clinical characteristics and factors affecting the duration of positive nucleic acid test for patients of COVID-19 in XinYu, China","The outbreak of a new coronavirus, COVID-19, which was earliest reported in Wuhan, China, is now transmitting throughout the world. The aim of this study was to articulate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and to reveal possible factors that may affect the persistent time of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, so as to identify which patients may deteriorate or have poor prognoses as early as possible. Retrospective cohort study was carried out on 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to XinYu People's Hospital of JiangXi Province. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratorial, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. In this study, patients were divided into two groups based on whether their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in respiratory specimens turn negative within (Group Rapid or Group R) or over (Group Slow or Group S) a week. There was no significant difference in age, sex, travel or exposure history, and smoking history between the two groups. Forty-two patients had been observed with comorbidities. Similar clinical manifestations, for instance fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue, have been observed among patients in both groups, except that patients in Group S were obviously more likely to get fatigue than patients in Group R. Both groups had shown decrease in white blood cell or lymphocyte counts. Chest X-ray or computed tomography scan showed unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. High proportion in both groups has used nasal cannula (89.47% vs. 85.71%) to inhale oxygen. 10.53% of Group S have applied high-flow nasal cannula, while Group R used none. The current treatment is mainly antibiotics, antiviral, and traditional Chinese medicine, while a couple of patients has used methylprednisolone. Only 1 patient out of both groups got even worse despite this active treatment. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include the exposure history and typical systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, decreased WBC and lymphocyte counts, and infiltration in both lower lobes on CT imaging. Among them, fatigue appears to be an important factor that affects the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in respiratory specimens.","Lu, Yin, Li, Fu, Hu, Huang, Chen, Li, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23534","20200829","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease; SARS-CoV-2; clinical characteristics; fatigue","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A rapid review of pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes","COVID-19 spread rapidly causing widescale loss of life and economic devastation. Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesise and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010-April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32,049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorised them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesised effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Jackson, Durkin, Gyamfi, Bhullar","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790","20200829","behaviour change; pandemic; psychological outcomes; rapid review; systematic review","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Demographic and health factors associated with pandemic anxiety in the context of COVID-19","The mental health consequences of COVID-19 are predicted to have a disproportionate impact on certain groups. We aimed to develop a brief measure, the Pandemic Anxiety Scale, to capture the specific aspects of the pandemic that are provoking anxiety, and explore how these vary by health and demographic factors. Data were from a convenience sample of parents (NÂ =Â 4,793) and adolescents (NÂ =Â 698) recruited in the first 6Â weeks of lockdown. Factor analytic and IRT methods were used to validate the new measure in both parent and adolescent samples. Associations between scores on the new measure and age, gender, household income, and physical health status were explored using structural equation modelling (SEM). Two factors were identified in both samples: disease anxiety (e.g., catching, transmitting the virus) and consequence anxiety (e.g., impact on economic prospects); and unique associations with health and demographic factors were observed. Anxieties due to the COVID-19 are multifaceted, and the PAS is a short, reliable, and valid measure of these concerns. These anxieties are differentially associated with demographic, social, and health factors, which should be considered when developing strategies to mitigate the mental health impact of the pandemic.","McElroy, Patalay, Moltrecht, Shevlin, Shum, Creswell, Waite","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12470","20200829","COVID-19; anxiety; lockdown; mental health; pandemic; scale development; validation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain","To evaluate compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain. Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop compassion fatigue or burnout, which puts them at risk for mental health problems. Cross-sectional online survey. A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire (ProQoL), and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies. Physicians had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while nurses had higher compassion satisfaction scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while levels of compassion satisfaction and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace. Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of compassion fatigue and burnout have remained moderate/high. However, compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve compassion satisfaction and prevent burnout and compassion fatigue among professionals in the long term.","Ruiz-FernÃ¡ndez, Ramos-Pichardo, IbÃ¡Ã±ez-Masero, Cabrera-Troya, Carmona-Rega, Ortega-GalÃ¡n","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15469","20200829","Burnout; COVID-19; Compassion Fatigue; Compassion Satisfaction; Healthcare Professionals","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Stress and parenting during the global COVID-19 pandemic","Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. This study examined the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 risk factors, mental health risk factors, protective factors, parental perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Greater COVID-19 related stressors and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher parental perceived stress. Receipt of financial assistance and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic are associated with lower perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related stressors, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.","Brown, Doom, Lechuga-PeÃ±a, Watamura, Koppels","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104699","20200901","COVID-19; Child maltreatment; Pandemic; Parenting; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Is the psychological impact of exposure to COVID-19 stronger in adolescents with pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences? A survey of rural Chinese adolescents","Since the COVID-19 outbreak at the end of 2019, it has evolved into a global pandemic with tremendous mental health impact besides the threats to people's physical health. The aims were to examine whether exposure to COVID-19 predicts elevated levels of anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms and whether pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences exacerbate this impact on mental health in adolescents. The survey was conducted online from February 8 st to February 27th, 2020, and the questionnaires were distributed and retrieved through a web-based platform. This study includes a total of 6196 subjects, aged range from 11 to 18 years old. Several multivariable linear regressions were used to analyse the data. The largest variance in PTSS and anxiety problems was explained by ACEs, with more pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences predicting more PTSS (effect size beta = 0.16âˆ¼0.27), and more anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32âˆ¼0.47). Experienced or subjective fear of exposure to COVID-19 predicted statistically significant variance in PTSS and anxiety, and standardized betas ranged from 0.04 to 0.09. Participants who had adverse childhood experiences and had experienced exposure to COVID-19 showed elevated PTSS. After pre-pandemic maltreatment experiences the impact of exposure to COVID-19 on mental health may be stronger. Scars from the past seem to be vulnerabilities during societal upheaval. We therefore suggest that when exposed to COVID-19 rural adolescents should get prioritized professional family support and mental health counseling in particular when they have experienced family abuse and neglect in childhood, even though such support is more difficult to organize in rural areas.","Guo, Fu, Liu, Zhang, Wang, van IJzendoorn","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104667","20200831","ACEs; Adolescents; Anxiety; Covid-19; Maltreatment; PTSS","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Emotional and Cognitive Responses and Behavioral Coping of Chinese Medical Workers and General Population during the Pandemic of COVID-19","The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) might affect the psychological health of population, especially medical workers. We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional and cognitive responses and behavioral coping among Chinese residents. An online investigation was run from 5 February to 25 February 2020, which recruited a total of 616 Chinese residents. Self-designed questionnaires were used to collect demographic information, epidemic knowledge and prevention of COVID-19 and characteristics of medical workers. The emotional and cognitive responses were assessed via the Symptom Check List-30 (SCL-30) and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Behavioral coping was assessed via Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). In total, 131 (21.3%) medical workers and 485 (78.7%) members of the general public completed the structured online survey. The structural equation models showed that emotional response interacted with cognitive response, and both emotional response and cognitive response affected the behavioral coping. Multivariate regression showed that positive coping enhanced emotional and cognitive responses, while negative coping reduced emotional and cognitive responses. The emotional response (depression, anxiety and photic anxiety) scores of the participants were higher than the norm (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001); in particular, the panic scores of members of the general public were higher than those of medical workers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), as well as the cognitive response (paranoia and compulsion). Both positive and negative coping scores of the participants were lower than the norm (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and the general public had higher negative coping than medical workers (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). During the preliminary stage of COVID-19, our study confirmed the significance of emotional and cognitive responses, which were associated with behavioral coping and significantly influenced the medical workers and the general public's cognition and level of public health emergency preparedness. These results emphasize the importance of psychological health at times of widespread crisis.","Cai, Zheng, Huang, Zhang, Qiu, Huang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176198","20200901","Corona Virus Disease 2019; behavioral coping; cognition; emotion","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Effect of Environmental Stressors on Tinnitus: A Prospective Longitudinal Study on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Tinnitus, the perception of sound in the absence of a corresponding sound, and the distress caused by it, is rarely a static phenomenon. It rather fluctuates over time depending on endogenous and exogenous factors. The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential environmental stressor that might influence the individually perceived tinnitus distress. Since not all people are affected by the pandemic in the same way, the situation allows one to identify environmental factors and personality traits that impact tinnitus distress differently. In our study, 122 tinnitus patients were included at two time points: in the year 2018 and during the German lockdown in April 2020. We assessed tinnitus-related distress, depressive symptoms, personality characteristics and the individual perception of the pandemic situation. On average, there was only a small increase of tinnitus distress with heterogeneous changes during the lockdown. People perceiving the situation as generally stressful with increased grief, frustration, stress and nervousness reported the worsening of tinnitus distress. People with high values in neuroticism also reported the worsening of tinnitus distress, while the personality traits extraversion, conscientiousness and openness seemed to be a protection factor. The study identifies factors that influence tinnitus distress change during a pandemic and spots those patients that need specific help in the pandemic situation.","Schlee, HÃ¸lleland, Bulla, Simoes, Neff, Schoisswohl, Woelflick, Schecklmann, Schiller, Staudinger, Probst, Langguth","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9092756","20200831","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; big five; coronavirus; pandemic; personality traits; quarantine; social isolation; stress; tinnitus distress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Professional Quality of Life and Mental Health Outcomes among Health Care Workers Exposed to Sars-Cov-2 (Covid-19)","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic spreading worldwide, and Italy represented the first European country involved. Healthcare workers (HCWs) facing COVID-19 pandemic represented an at-risk population for new psychosocial COVID-19 strain and consequent mental health symptoms. The aim of the present study was to identify the possible impact of working contextual and personal variables (age, gender, working position, years of experience, proximity to infected patients) on professional quality of life, represented by compassion satisfaction (CS), burnout, and secondary traumatization (ST), in HCWs facing COVID-19 emergency. Further, two multivariable linear regression analyses were fitted to explore the association of mental health selected outcomes, anxiety and depression, with some personal and working characteristics that are COVID-19-related. A sample of 265 HCWs of a major university hospital in central Italy was consecutively recruited at the outpatient service of the Occupational Health Department during the acute phase of COVID-19 pandemic. HCWs were assessed by Professional Quality of Life-5 (ProQOL-5), the Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Seven-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) to evaluate, respectively, CS, burnout, ST, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Females showed higher ST than males, while frontline staff and healthcare assistants reported higher CS rather than second-line staff and physicians, respectively. Burnout and ST, besides some work or personal variables, were associated to depressive or anxiety scores. The COVID-19 pandemic represents a new working challenge for HCWs and intervention strategies to prevent burnout and ST to reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes are needed.","Buselli, Corsi, Baldanzi, Chiumiento, Del Lupo, Dell'Oste, Bertelloni, Massimetti, Dell'Osso, Cristaudo, Carmassi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176180","20200901","COVID-19; burnout; compassion satisfaction (CS); healthcare workers (HCWs); professional quality of life (ProQOL-5); secondary traumatization (ST)","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental health interventions and supports during COVID- 19 and other medical pandemics: A rapid systematic review of the evidence","Novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) is a global reminder of the need to attend to the mental health of patients and health professionals who are suddenly facing this public health crisis. In the last two decades, a number of medical pandemics have yielded insights on the mental health impact of these events. Based on these experiences and given the magnitude of the current pandemic, rates of mental health disorders are expected to increase. Mental health interventions are urgently needed to minimize the psychological sequelae and provide timely care to affected individuals. We conducted a rapid systematic review of mental health interventions during a medical pandemic, using three electronic databases. Of the 2404 articles identified, 21 primary research studies are included in this review. We categorized the findings from the research studies using the following questions: What kind of emotional reactions do medical pandemics trigger? Who is most at risk of experiencing mental health sequelae? What works to treat mental health sequelae (psychosocial interventions and implementation of existing or new training programs)? What do we need to consider when designing and implementing mental health interventions (cultural adaptations and mental health workforce)? What still needs to be known? Various mental health interventions have been developed for medical pandemics, and research on their effectiveness is growing. We offer recommendations for future research based on the evidence for providing mental health interventions and supports to those most in need.","Soklaridis, Lin, Lalani, Rodak, Sockalingam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.08.007","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"First report of manic-like symptoms in a COVID-19 patient with no previous history of a psychiatric disorder","In December 2019, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection was first reported in Wuhan city, central China, which has spread rapidly. The common clinical features of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection included fever, fatigue, and damage to the respiratory or digestive system. However, it is still unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 infection could cause damage to the central nervous system (CNS) inducing psychiatric symptoms. Herein, we present the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with manic-like symptoms and describe the diagnosis, clinical course, and treatment of the case, focusing on the identifications of SARS-CoV-2 in the specimen of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient developed manic-like symptoms when his vital signs recovered on illness day 17. After manic-like attack, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in CSF was positive, while the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on CSF for the SARS-CoV-2 was negative. The patient received Olanzapine for treatment and his mood problems concurrently improved as indicated by scores of Young Manic Rating Scale (YMRS). This is a single case report only, and the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF was not performed simultaneously when SARS-CoV-2 was positive in samples of sputum and stool. This first case of COVID-19 patient with manic-like symptoms highlights the importance of evaluation of mental health status and may contribute to our understanding of potential risk of CNS impairments by SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lu, Wei, Jiang, Wu, Sheng, Zhou, Fang, Chen, Zheng, Chen, Liang, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.031","20200903","Cerebrospinal fluid; IgG; Manic-like symptoms; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Immediate impact of stay-at-home orders to control COVID-19 transmission on socioeconomic conditions, food insecurity, mental health, and intimate partner violence in Bangladeshi women and their families: an interrupted time series","Stay-at-home orders (lockdowns) have been deployed globally to control COVID-19 transmission, and might impair economic conditions and mental health, and exacerbate risk of food insecurity and intimate partner violence. The effect of lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries must be understood to ensure safe deployment of these interventions in less affluent settings. We aimed to determine the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on women and their families in rural Bangladesh. An interrupted time series was used to compare data collected from families in Rupganj upazila, rural Bangladesh (randomly selected from participants in a randomised controlled trial), on income, food security, and mental health a median of 1 year and 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to data collected during the lockdown. We also assessed women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Between May 19 and June 18, 2020, we randomly selected and invited the mothers of 3016 children to participate in the study, 2424 of whom provided consent. 2414 (99Â·9%, 95% CI 99Â·6-99Â·9) of 2417 mothers were aware of, and adhering to, the stay-at-home advice. 2321 (96Â·0%, 95Â·2-96Â·7) of 2417 mothers reported a reduction in paid work for the family. Median monthly family income fell from US$212 at baseline to $59 during lockdown, and the proportion of families earning less than $1Â·90 per day rose from five (0Â·2%, 0Â·0-0Â·5) of 2422 to 992 (47Â·3%, 45Â·2-49Â·5) of 2096 (p&lt;0Â·0001 comparing baseline with lockdown period). Before the pandemic, 136 (5Â·6%, 4Â·7-6Â·6) of 2420 and 65 (2Â·7%, 2Â·1-3Â·4) of 2420 families experienced moderate and severe food insecurity, respectively. This increased to 881 (36Â·5%, 34Â·5-38Â·4) of 2417 and 371 (15Â·3%, 13Â·9-16Â·8) of 2417 during the lockdown; the number of families experiencing any level of food insecurity increased by 51Â·7% (48Â·1-55Â·4; p&lt;0Â·0001). Mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the lockdown. Among women experiencing emotional or moderate physical violence, over half reported it had increased since the lockdown. COVID-19 lockdowns present significant economic, psychosocial, and physical risks to the wellbeing of women and their families across economic strata in rural Bangladesh. Beyond supporting only the most socioeconomically deprived, support is needed for all affected families.

"Anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital in Wuhan, China","Fangcang shelter hospitals were established in China during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as a countermeasure to stop the spread of the disease. To our knowledge, no research has been conducted on mental health problems among patients in Fangcang shelter hospitals. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and major influencing factors of anxiety and depressive symptoms among COVID-19 patients admitted to Fangcang shelter hospitals. From February 23, 2020, to February 26, 2020, we obtained sociodemographic and clinical characteristics information of COVID-19 patients in Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital (Wuhan, China) and assessed their mental health status and sleep quality. Data were obtained with an online questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of a set of items on demographic characteristics, a set of items on clinical characteristics, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Three hundred seven COVID-19 patients who were admitted to Jianghan Fangcang Shelter Hospital participated in this study. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms were 18.6% and 13.4%, respectively. Poor sleep quality and having â‰¥ two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for anxiety symptoms. Female sex, having a family member with confirmed COVID-19, and having â‰¥ two current physical symptoms were independent risk factors for depressive symptoms. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were found to be common among COVID-19 patients in Fangcang Shelter Hospital, with some patients being at high risk.","Dai, Wang, Jiang, Li, Wang, Wu, Jia, Liu, An, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238416","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Perinatal distress during COVID-19: a thematic analysis of an online parenting forum","The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has impacted the whole of society, requiring rapid implementation of individual, population and system level public health responses to contain and reduce the spread of infection. Women in the perinatal period (pregnant, birthing and postpartum) have unique and timely needs for directives on health, safety and risk aversion during periods of isolation and physical distancing for themselves, their child or children and other family members. In addition, they are a vulnerable group, at increased risk of psychological distress that may be exacerbated in the context of social support deprivation and a high risk external environment. Examination of the public discourse of a perinatal cohort to understand unmet health information and support needs and impacts on mothering identity and social dynamics, in the context of COVID-19. A leading Australian online support forum for women pre- through to post-birth was used to interrogate all posts related to COVID-19 from Jan 27 to May 12 2020 inclusive. Key search terms included: 'COVID', 'corona' and 'pandemic'. A three-phase analysis was conducted including: thematic analysis, sentiment analysis and word frequency calculations. The search yielded 960 posts, of which 831 were included in our analysis. Qualitative thematic analysis demonstrated reasonable understanding, interpretation and application of relevant restrictions in place, with five emerging themes identified. These were: 1) heightened distress related to a high-risk external environment; 2) despair and anticipatory grief due to deprivation of social and family support, and bonding rituals; 3) altered family and support relationships; 4) guilt tampered happiness; and, 5) family future postponed. Sentiment analysis revealed content was predominantly negative (very negative: 537 and moderately negative: 443 compared to very positive: 236 and moderately positive: 340). Negative words were frequently used with associated derivatives including 'worried' (19.9%); 'risk' (17.2%); 'anxiety' (11.8%); 'concerns' (8.8%) and 'stress' (8.3%). Women in the perinatal period are uniquely impacted by the current pandemic. General information on COVID-19 safe behaviors did not meet the particular needs of this cohort. The lack of nuanced and timely information may exacerbate risk of psychological and psychosocial distress in this vulnerable, high-risk group. State and federal public health departments need to provide a central repository of information that is targeted, consistent, accessible, timely and reassuring. Compensatory social and emotional support should be considered, using alternative measures to mitigate the risk of mental health disorders in this cohort.","Chivers, Garad, Boyle, Skouteris, Teede, Harrison","https://doi.org/10.2196/22002","20200828",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients included in a bariatric surgery program","The COVID-19 pandemic has radically impacted the world lifestyle. Epidemics are well-known to cause mental distress, and patients with a current or past history of obesity are at increased risk for the common presence of psychological comorbidities. This study investigates the psychological impact of the current pandemic in patients participating in a bariatric surgery program. Patients were consecutively enrolled during the Italian lockdown among those waiting for bariatric surgery or attending a post-bariatric follow-up, and were asked to complete through an online platform the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and a self-assessment questionnaire of 22 items evaluating the resilience, change in eating behavior and emotional responses referring to the ongoing pandemic. 59% of the 434 enrolled subjects reported of being worried about the pandemic, and 63% specifically reported of being worried about their or their relatives' health. 37% and 56% felt lonelier and more bored, respectively. 66% was hungrier with increased frequency of snacking (55%) and 39% reported more impulse to eat. Noteworthy, 49% felt unable to follow a recommended diet. No difference in terms of psychological profile was recorded among pre and post-bariatric subjects. Logistic regression analysis on post-bariatric patients showed a relationship between snacking, hunger, eating impulsivity, and anxiety, stress, and/or depression symptoms. The pandemic led to increased psychological distress in patients with a current or past history of obesity, reducing quality of life and affecting dietary compliance. Targeted psychological support is warranted in times of increased stress for fragile subjects such as pre- and post-bariatric patients.

"Impact on mental health care and on mental health service users of the COVID-19 pandemic: a mixed methods survey of UK mental health care staff","The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.","Johnson, Dalton-Locke, Vera San Juan, Foye, Oram, Papamichail, Landau, Rowan Olive, Jeynes, Shah, Sheridan Rains, Lloyd-Evans, Carr, Killaspy, Gillard, Simpson, Bell, Bentivegna, Botham, Edbrooke-Childs, Goldsmith, GrÃ¼nwald, Harju-SeppÃ¤nen, Hatch, Henderson, Howard, Lane, Ledden, Leverton, Lomani, Lyons, McCrone, Ntephe, Ocloo, Osborn, Pilling, Poursanidou, Scott, Steare, Stuart, Tomlin, Turner, Tzouvara","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01927-4","20200830","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health care; Mental health services; Mental health staff; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Discriminating Metabolic Health Status in a Cohort of Nursing Students: Protocol for a Cross-Sectional Study","Obesity is currently a worldwide health crisis. Nurses are integral members of the primary health care team and have an important role in managing obesity and administering physical activity (PA) for patients. However, research shows that nurses tend to be overweight or obese, have poor metabolic health, and do not meet PA recommendations. This is problematic because PA is linked to both physiological and psychological well-being and may also influence how nurses counsel their patients. Nursing students are the next generation of nurses; however, there is limited research examining PA (among other lifestyle factors) and metabolic health in nursing students. The goal of this research is to examine multiple lifestyle factors (including PA, nutrition, sleep, and stress) and determine whether these factors are associated with metabolic health in full-time undergraduate nursing students. An estimated 320 nursing students (18 years of age and older) will be assessed for their metabolic health. Metabolic status will be determined by measuring body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage [skinfold measures (FitSystems Inc)], resting blood pressure [automated oscillatory (Omron Healthcare Inc)], and fasting blood glucose (glucometer). Lifestyle factors will also be measured, including PA and sleep [the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) and 7-day accelerometry (wGT3X-BT, Actigraph LLC)], nutrition [3-day diet log (Nutritionist Pro, Axxya Systems)], and stress [the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, heart rate variability assessments, and salivary cortisol (ELISA, Eagle Biosciences)]. The association between metabolic status and PA, sleep quantity and quality, nutrition, and stress will be examined by linear regression analyses. Differences by year of study in metabolic health status, PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress will be examined by 1-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). To determine the ability of PA, sleep, nutrition, and stress to discriminate prevalent overweight and obesity or poor metabolic status, logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves will be constructed. Statistical analyses will be performed in Stata (version 16.1, StataCorp LLC). Based on pilot data, we believe senior nursing students will have worse metabolic health (ie, higher BMI and WHR, increased body fat percentage, higher blood pressure, and increased fasting blood glucose) compared to first-year students. We hypothesize that poor PA participation, poor sleep quantity and quality, increased food intake, poor nutrition, and increased stress will be associated with worse metabolic health in full-time nursing students. The study received funding in February 2020. Due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, work on this study has been delayed. We are currently completing our application for institutional research ethics approval. Data collection is projected to begin in January 2021, with data collection and analyses expected to be completed by May 2022. This study will be the first published research to examine the relationship between lifestyle choices and metabolic status in nursing students attending a Canadian institution. More importantly, the results of this study will support the development of an informed intervention that will target the identified lifestyle factors, improving the physiological and mental health and well-being of nursing students.

To examine the ethical challenges encountered by nurses caring for patients with the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) and to provide nurses with suggestions and support regarding promotion of their mental health. A qualitative study was carried out using a qualitative content analysis. The participants were 18 nurses who agreed to attend an interview and describe their own experiences of providing care to COVID-19 patients in China. They were purposively sampled, and structured, in-depth interviews were performed. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed from February to March 2020. The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Second Hospital of Shandong University, China. The findings revealed three main themes and 10 categories. The themes were the following: (1) ethical challenges (people with COVID-19, inequality, professional ethics, and job competency); (2) coping styles (active control and planning, seeking support as well as catharsis, and staying focused); and (3) impacts on career (specialized nursing skills, scientific research ability, and management skills).

"The Role of Anxiety and Cortisol in Outcomes of Patients With Covid-19","The outbreak due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is n global public health emergency and challenges psychological resilience. The central nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system are complex interacting systems. Cortisol has been implicated as the cause of a wide range of mental and physical health disorders; however, the impact of cortisol on outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is not clear. The current study enrolled patients with COVID-19 (onset of disease within 7 days of the first symptom) to evaluate the serum concentration of cortisol and levels of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) to investigate a possible relationship between cortisol, depression, and anxiety levels and outcomes of patients with COVID-19. A total of 30 patients with COVID-19 were studied. The levels of cortisol and HADS score in patients who died of Covid-19 were significantly higher in comparison with surviving patients (P&lt;0.017 and P&lt;0.001 respectively). We also found that the HADS score was positively correlated with serum cortisol levels (r= 0.842, P=0.004). Our findings showed that stress and anxiety are associated with patients' outcomes.

"How People Emotionally Respond to the News on COVID-19: An Online Survey","During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, news media has played an important role in informing people to satisfy their curiosity about this stressful condition. Regular exposure to such stressful news may elicit different emotions in people and engage them in using strategies to control their emotions. In the present study, we aimed at exploring the most common negative emotion(s) experienced by individuals, as well as the most frequent Emotion Regulation (ER) strategies used facing the COVID-19-related news. We also examined whether the variable of personal relevance can moderate these emotional responses. 617 individuals living in Tehran who regularly read the news about the COVID-19 from the early stages of spread completed an online survey. After excluding the participants with high scores from the Beck Depression Inventory (&gt;18), data obtained from 443 participants were analyzed in terms of the experienced negative emotions and ER strategies. Anxiety (55.8%) was the most common negative emotion reported by participants facing COVID-19-related news and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy used to control negative emotions. Both groups with high and low personal relevance indicated a similar pattern in experiencing high and low arousal emotions, as well as using ER strategies, and no significant differences were found (X<sup>2</sup>=0.006, p=0.51; X<sup>2</sup>=0.14, p=0.39, respectively). We also found that participants with high scores in the resilience scale used an integrative rather than a single approach of the ER strategies (rbp=0.15, p=0.01). We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak, news media may have important role in triggering anxiety in people who regularly read the relevant news, and problem-solving was the most frequent strategy among them.

"Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Levels Among Healthcare Staff During the COVID-19 Epidemic","In the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, medical staff Are in direct contact with the patients and experience high work pressure. Direct contact with the patients could create some psychological problems in this group. Thus, the prevalence of such problems must be investigated in them. The present study aimed to determine the level of stress, anxiety, and depression among the healthcare staff in Zanjan City, Iran, during the COVID-19 epidemic. This descriptive study has a cross-sectional design. The Sample of the study population consisted of 535 Staff healthcare members of Vali-e-Asr Hospital in Zanjan City, Iran. A sample of 200 of medical staff was randomly selected to participate in the present study. The required data were collected using the electronic version of Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS) tool. Descriptive statistics, as well as the inferential statistics (the Pearson correlation coefficient, Spearman correlation coefficient, Phi, and Cramer's correlation tests), were used to analyze the obtained data in SPSS. The mean age of the study participants was 40.60 years. The mean values of depression, anxiety, and stress in study samples were 6.27, 5.38, and 8.41, respectively. There was a significant relation between gender and variables of depression, anxiety, and stress. There was also an inverse relationship between stress and variables of educational level and age (P&lt;0/05). We found that our sample reported a normal degree of Depression, anxiety, and stress. The extent of stress induced by direct contact with patients was higher in female employees. Furthermore, with the increase in the education and age of the employees, their stress level decreased.","Hosseinzadeh-Shanjani, Hajimiri, Rostami, Ramazani, Dadashi","https://doi.org/10.32598/bcn.11.covid19.651.4","20200829","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Medical staff; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Exposure to health misinformation about COVID-19 and increased tobacco and alcohol use: a population-based survey in Hong Kong","Health information about COVID-19 has been circulating in social networking sites, including unproven claims that smoking and alcohol drinking could protect against COVID-19. We examined if exposure to such claims was associated with changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption. We conducted a population-based, landline and mobile phone survey of 1501 randomly sampled adults aged 18 years or older (47.5% male) in Hong Kong in April 2020. Respondents reported if they had ever seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from popular social networking platforms. Current tobacco and alcohol users reported if they had increased or reduced their consumption since the outbreak. Prevalence data were weighted by sex, age and education of the general adult population. 19.0% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.4%) of all respondents reported having seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from social networking sites. Multinomial logistic regression showed that exposure to the claims was significantly associated with increased tobacco use (OR 2.37, 95%â€‰CI 1.08 to 5.20) in current tobacco users (N=280) and increased alcohol use (OR 4.16, 95%â€‰CI 2.00 to 8.67) in current drinkers (N=722), adjusting for sex, age, education level, alcohol/tobacco use status, home isolation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and survey method.

"Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels and Related Factors Among Operating Theater Workers During the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on health care workers because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among health care professionals working in operating theaters (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The universe of this descriptive study consisted of health care professionals working in operating theaters in various health care institutions in Turkey. Data were collected online between April 9, 2020 and April 12, 2020 using a SurveyMonkey Questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) and health care workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. A total of 702 health care professionals working in operating theaters participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4Â Â±Â 4.6 (min 0 to max 21) and 10.0Â Â±Â 4.5 (min 0 to max 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60Â years or older (PÂ &lt;Â .05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease, and those whose workload increased (PÂ &lt;Â .05). The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among health care professionals working in operating theaters.

"Material hardship and parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: The mediating role of grandparents' mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of many families, including grandparent kinship families, to deal with a health/economic crisis. The fear of COVID-19 plus stay-at-home orders have increased individuals' psychological distress. Moreover, school closures and homeschooling further increased parenting stress among caregivers. This study examined the relationship between material hardship and parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers, and assessed grandparents' mental health as a potential mediator to this relationship during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Grandparent kinship providers (N = 362) that took primary care of their grandchildren participated in a cross-sectional survey via Qualtrics Panels in June 2020 in the United States. Descriptive and bivariate analyses, binary logistic regression, and mediation analyses were conducted using STATA 15.0. Suffering material hardship was significantly associated with higher odds of experiencing parenting stress among grandparent kinship providers, and grandparents' mental health partially mediated this association. Addressing material and mental health needs among grandparent kinship providers is critical to decreasing their parenting stress.","Xu, Wu, Levkoff, Jedwab","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104700","20200830","COVID-19; Grandparent kinship providers; Material hardship; Mental health; Parenting stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological distress and sleep problems when people are under interpersonal isolation during an epidemic: A nationwide multicenter cross-sectional study","During the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people are under the dual pressure of interpersonal isolation and concerns about infection. An evaluation of people's psychological status and risk factors is needed to conduct target interventions. This was a nationwide, multicenter, cross-sectional study using quota and snowball sampling methods during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. Participants' characteristics and experiences were obtained by an online questionnaire and telephone review. Psychological distress and sleep problems were measured by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and the Insomnia Severity Index. A total of 23,500 participants were recruited, and 19,372 valid questionnaires were received from 11 centers. Overall, 11.0-13.3% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms, and 1.9-2.7% had severe symptoms. The prevalence of psychological and sleep problems has increased. Working as frontline medical staff (Odds Ratio ORÂ =Â 3.406), living in Hubei Province (ORÂ =Â 2.237), close contacts with COVID-19 (ORÂ =Â 1.808), and age 35-49Â years (ORÂ =Â 1.310) were risk factors for anxiety symptoms; no outside activity for 2Â weeks (ORÂ =Â 2.167) and age 35-49Â years (ORÂ =Â 1.198) were risk factors for depression symptoms; and living in Hubei Province (ORÂ =Â 2.376), no outside activity for 2Â weeks (ORÂ =Â 1.927), and age 35-49Â years (ORÂ =Â 1.262) were risk factors for insomnia symptoms.

"Coping style, social support and psychological distress in the general Chinese population in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic","The purpose of this study was to investigate the psychological status of the general population in mainland China during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to explore the factors influencing psychological distress, in order to provide the basis for further psychological intervention programs. We administered three questionnaires on-line to a convenience sample of the general population from different regions of mainland China from February 1 to February 4, 2020. We used the Mandarin versions of the six-item Kessler psychological distress scale (K6), the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). We also collected demographic data and other information related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing psychological distress. Of 1607 respondents, 1588 returned valid questionnaires and were included in the analysis. Nearly one quarter (22.8%) had high levels of psychological distress (K6 scoreâ€‰â‰¥â€‰13). Individuals with higher psychological distress were more likely to be unmarried, spend more than 6â€‰h per day searching for information about COVID-19, more frequently adopt a passive coping style, and report less social support than those with lower psychological distress. The COVID-19 outbreak in China has a great impact on the mental health status of the general population. Active coping strategies and increased social support are significantly correlated with decreased psychological distress, and may serve as the basis for psychological interventions.","Yu, Li, Li, Xiang, Yuan, Liu, Li, Xiong","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02826-3","20200831","COVID-19; Coping style; Cross-sectional; Psychological distress; Social support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental health among head and neck surgeons in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic: A national study","Head and neck surgeons are among the highest risk for COVID-19 exposure, which also brings great risk to their mental wellbeing. In this study, we aim to evaluate mental health symptoms among head and neck surgeons in Brazil surrounding the time it was declared the epicenter of the virus. A cross-sectional, survey-based study evaluating burnout, anxiety, distress, and depression among head and neck surgeons in Brazil, assessed through the single-item Mini-Z burnout assessment, 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. 163 physicians completed the survey (74.2% males). Anxiety, distress, burnout, and depression symptoms were reported in 74 (45.5%), 43 (26.3%), 24 (14.7%), and 26 (16.0%) physicians, respectively. On multivariable analysis, female physicians were more likely to report a positive screening for burnout compared to males (OR 2.88, CI [1.07-7.74]). Physicians 45Â years or older were less likely to experience anxiety symptoms than those younger than 45Â years (OR 0.40, CI [0.20-0.81]). Physicians with no self-reported prior psychiatric conditions were less likely to have symptoms of distress compared to those with such history (OR 0.11, CI [0.33-0.38]).

"Job-related factors associated with changes in sleep quality among healthcare workers screening for 2019 novel coronavirus infection: a longitudinal study","Sleep disorders may exacerbate many physical and mental health conditions, causing difficulty function in a healthcare setting. Workers screening for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection have a high risk of not only occupational exposure to the virus but also sleep disorders. However, the job-related factors associated with reduced sleep quality remain unclear. All healthcare workers temporarily scheduled to screen the 2019-nCoV patients were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire that included questions on demographics, job-related factors, and sleep quality as assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Sleep quality was assessed over a one-month follow-up period. A total of 116 doctors and 99 nurses were recruited for this study. The total scheduled work time was 14.78Â Â±Â 6.69 days during follow-up. Some job-related factors, such as number of work days, years of work experience, and subjective psychological stress, were associated with changes in the PSQI score. During the study, some workers tried out cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for sleep disorders using methods that were available online and easily accessible. Adopting online CBT was shown to be associated with scores of components of sleep quality, sleep latency, and sleep disturbance (Î²Â =Â -0.152, PÂ =Â 0.01; Î²Â =Â -0.175, PÂ =Â 0.008; and Î²Â =Â -0.158, PÂ =Â 0.011, respectively).

"Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide: Biosynthesis, Consumption, and Therapeutic Role in Cardiac Diseases","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an abundant cofactor that plays crucial roles in several cellular processes. NAD can be synthesized de novo starting with tryptophan, or from salvage pathways starting with NAD precursors like nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (NAM), or nicotinamide riboside (NR), referred to as niacin/B<sub>3</sub> vitamins, arising from dietary supply or from cellular NAD catabolism. Given the interconversion between its oxidized (NAD<sup>+</sup> ) and reduced form (NADH), NAD participates in a wide range of reactions: regulation of cellular redox status, energy metabolism, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Plus, NAD acts as a signaling molecule, being a co-substrate for several enzymes such as sirtuins, poly-ADP-ribose-polymerases (PARPs), and some ectoenzymes like CD38, regulating critical biological processes like gene expression, DNA repair, calcium signaling, and circadian rhythms. Given the large number of mitochondria present in cardiac tissue, the heart has the highest NAD levels and is one of the most metabolically demanding organs. In several models of heart failure, myocardial NAD levels are depressed and this depression is caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic remodeling, and inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that regulating NAD homeostasis by NAD precursor supplementation has therapeutic efficiency in improving myocardial bioenergetics and function. This review provides an overview of the latest understanding of the different NAD biosynthesis pathways, as well as its role as a signaling molecule particularly in cardiac tissue. We highlight the significance of preserving NAD equilibrium in various models of heart disease and shed light on the potential pharmacological interventions aiming to use NAD boosters as therapeutic agents.","Tannous, Booz, Altara, Muhieddine, Mericksay, Refaat, Zouein","https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13551","20200827","COVID-19; Cardiac diseases; Cardiac metabolism; Inflammation; Mitochondria; NAD; Redox potential; Transcription factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Distress and Coronavirus Fears During the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant health and economic crisis around the world. The U.S. saw a rapid escalation in laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and related deaths in March, 2020. The financial consequences of a virtual economic shutdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus are widespread and debilitating, with over 30 million Americans (about 20% of the labor force) filing for unemployment benefits since mid-March. During these unprecedented times, it is important to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress and overall fear associated with the virus. To gain an understanding of the overall levels and predictors of psychological distress experienced in the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., a survey was administered online to over 2,000 individuals residing in the country. The survey instrument was administered between March 22-26, 2020, during which time the country was suffering through a period of exponential growth in COVID-19 cases and fatalities. It was administered via MTurk, a popular crowdsourcing platform increasingly used by social scientists to procure large samples over a brief period of time. A short, valid screening instrument to measure psychological distress in individuals, the Kessler 10 scale was developed in the U.S. in the 1990s as an easy-to-administer symptom assessment. The first dependent variable is the respondents' summated Kessler 10 score. The second dependent variable is a 7-category measure of how afraid the subject is about the novel coronavirus. The final dependent variable is also a 7-category scale, this time measuring self-reported likelihood of contracting the coronavirus. A variety of socio-demographic variables and health status were collected to analyze factors associated with psychological distress and mental health. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression was employed to analyze these data. We find that protective factors against psychological distress include age, gender (male), and physical health. Factors exacerbating psychological distress include Hispanic ethnicity and a previous mental illness diagnosis. Similar factors are significantly related to fear of the virus and self-assessed likelihood of contracting it. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with high levels of psychological distress in the U.S. The Kessler 10 mean value in our sample is 21.12, which falls in the likely to experience mild mental illness category, yet is considerably higher compared to one of the largest and earliest benchmark studies validating the scale. Psychological distress is one element of overall mental health status that could be influenced by the COVID-10 pandemic. Other mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders could also be affected by the pandemic. We encourage researchers to examine these and other mental health disorders in future research on the COVID-19 pandemic. The relatively high mean score (21.12) for psychological distress during early stages of the pandemic suggests government officials, policy-makers, and public health advocates should act quickly to address emerging mental health problems.","French, Mortensen, Timming","https://www.google.com/search?q=Psychological+Distress+and+Coronavirus+Fears+During+the+Initial+Phase+of+the+COVID-19+Pandemic+in+the+United+States.","20200827",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Getting back to the &quot;new normal&quot;: Autonomy restoration during a global pandemic","We investigate the psychological recovery process of full-time employees during the 2-week period at the onset of the Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). Past research suggests that recovery processes start <i>after</i> stressors abate and can take months or years to unfold. In contrast, we build on autonomy restoration theory to suggest that recovery of impaired autonomy starts immediately even as a stressor is ongoing. Using growth curve modeling, we examined the temporal trajectories of two manifestations of impaired autonomy-powerlessness and (lack of) authenticity-to test whether recovery began as the pandemic unfolded. We tested our predictions using a unique experience-sampling dataset collected over a 2-week period beginning on the Monday after COVID-19 was declared a &quot;global pandemic&quot; by the World Health Organization and a &quot;national emergency&quot; by the U.S. Government (March 16-27, 2020). Results suggest that autonomy restoration was activated even as the pandemic worsened. Employees reported decreasing powerlessness and increasing authenticity during this period, despite their subjective stress-levels not improving. Further, the trajectories of recovery for both powerlessness and authenticity were steeper for employees higher (vs. lower) in neuroticism, a personality characteristic central to stress reactions. Importantly, these patterns do not emerge in a second experience-sampling study collected prior to the COVID-19 crisis (September 9-20, 2019), highlighting how the pandemic initially threatened employee autonomy, but also how employees began to recover their sense of autonomy almost immediately. The present research provides novel insights into employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic and suggests that psychological recovery can begin during a stressful experience.

"Hemoglobin A1C is a Predictor of COVID-19 Severity in Patients with Diabetes","Poor outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been linked to diabetes but its relation to pre-infection glycemic control is still unclear. To address this question we report here the association between pre-infection HemoglobinA1c (A1C) levels and COVID-19 severity as assessed by need for hospitalization in a cohort of 2068 patients with diabetes tested for COVID-19 in Leumit Health Services, Israel, between February 1 and April 30, 2020. Using the LHS integrated electronic medical records system we were able to collect a large amount of clinical information including age, sex, socioeconomic status, weight, height, body mass index, A1C, prior diagnosis of ischemic heart disease, depression/anxiety, schizophrenia, dementia, hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure , smoking and chronic lung disease. Of the patients included in the cohort, 183 (8.85 %) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and 46 were admitted to hospital. More hospitalized patients were female, came from higher socioeconomic background and had a higher baseline A1C. A prior diagnosis of cerebrovascular accident and chronic lung disease conferred an increased risk of hospitalization but not obesity or smoking status. In a multivariate analysis, controlling for multiple prior clinical conditions, the only parameter associated with a significantly increased risk for hospitalization was A1Câ‰¥9%. Using pre-infection glycemic control data we identify A1C as a clear predictor of COVID-19 severity. Pre-infection risk stratification is crucial to successfully manage this disease, efficiently allocate resources and minimize the economic and social burden associated with an undiscriminating approach.

"Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System Inhibitors and Risk of Death in Patients Hospitalised with COVID-19: A Retrospective Italian Cohort Study of 43,000 Patients","The epidemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been spreading globally, raising increasing concerns. There are several controversial hypotheses on the potentially harmful or beneficial effects of antihypertensive drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Furthermore, there is accumulating evidence, based on several observational studies, that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) do not increase the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection. On the other hand, conflicting findings regarding the role of ACEIs/ARBs as prognosis modifiers in COVID-19 hospitalised patients have been reported. The aim of this large-scale, retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether prior exposure to ACEIs and/or ARBs was associated with all-cause mortality among over 40,000 hospitalised COVID-19 patients compared with calcium channel blockers (CCBs), a potential therapeutic alternative. This study was conducted using COVID-19 registries linked to claims databases from Lombardy, Veneto and Reggio Emilia (overall, 25% of Italian population). Overall, 42,926 patients hospitalised between 21 February and 21 April 2020 with a diagnosis of COVID-19 confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction tests were included in this study. All-cause mortality occurring in or out of hospital, as reported in the COVID-19 registry, was estimated. Using Cox models, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality (along with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were estimated separately for ACEIs/ARBs and other antihypertensives versus CCBs and non-use. Overall, 11,205 in- and out-of-hospital deaths occurred over a median of 24Â days of follow-up after hospital admission due to COVID-19. Compared with CCBs, adjusted analyses showed no difference in the risk of death among ACEI (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.89-1.06) or ARB (HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89-1.06) users. When non-use of antihypertensives was considered as a comparator, a modest statistically significant increase in mortality risk was observed for any antihypertensive use. However, when restricting to drugs with antihypertensive indications only, these marginal increases disappeared. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses confirmed our main findings. ACEI/ARB use is not associated with either an increased or decreased risk of all-cause mortality, compared with CCB use, in the largest cohort of hospitalised COVID-19 patients exposed to these drugs studied to date. The use of these drugs therefore does not affect the prognosis of COVID-19. This finding strengthens recommendations of international regulatory agencies about not withdrawing/switching ACEI/ARB treatments to modify COVID-19 prognosis.","TrifirÃ², Massari, Da Cas, Menniti Ippolito, Sultana, Crisafulli, Giorgi Rossi, Marino, Zorzi, Bovo, Leoni, Ludergnani, Spila Alegiani, Spila Alegiani, Menniti Ippolito, Da Cas, Massari, Traversa, Onder, TrifirÃ², Sultana, Ientile, Crisafulli, Giorgi Rossi, Grilli, Formoso, Marino, Vicentini, Leoni, Ludergnani, Cereda, Ferroni, Guzzinati, Bovo, Zorzi, Gion","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00994-5","20200829",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Effectiveness and influencing factors of online education for caregivers of patients with eating disorders during COVID-19 pandemic in China","The goals were twofold: To estimate the depression and anxiety levels among caregivers of patients with eating disorders (ED) in China during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with a control group, and to assess whether an online education program was effective in decreasing the anxiety and depression of the caregivers of patients with ED, and associated factors. Caregivers of patients with ED (n = 254) and a comparison group of non-ED caregivers (N = 254) were recruited at baseline. Additionally, caregivers of patients with ED were invited into a free 4-week online education program, with an additional online group as support. Depression and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Caregivers of patients with ED showed significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than the comparison group of non-ED caregivers. The online education program showed no significant effect on decreasing depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of patients with ED overall. Caregivers who had older loved ones and not living with them were more likely to decrease their depression levels. Caregivers of patients with longer illness duration were less likely to decrease their anxiety levels. These results showed that caregivers of ED patients suffered more serious psychological distress during the pandemic. A more structured and intensive online intervention with a limited number of participants might be required to address caregivers' distress in post-COVID-19 China.","Guo, Wu, Zhu, Zhang, Peng, Li, Chen, FernÃ¡ndez-Aranda, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2783","20200903","COVID-19; caregivers; eating disorders; online intervention","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prospects for improving future mental health of children through prenatal maternal micronutrient supplementation in China","Prenatal micronutrients in pregnant women's diets, including supplements, have an essential role in fetal brain development and may reduce the risk of mental disorders in offspring. Folic acid, vitamin D, omega-3 fatty acids, and choline have been investigated for this purpose. Folic acid supplementation throughout pregnancy has well-established positive effects. Vitamin D, administered to the mother before birth or to the newborn, has also been shown to reduce the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Omega-3 fatty acids during pregnancy have a more uncertain role, with recent trials questioning a beneficial effect on cognition and attention deficit disorder, despite positive effects on prematurity and neonatal wheezing prevention. Choline supplementation is associated with positive effects on cognition and behavior, including early behaviors associated with the development of autism and schizophrenia. There is no experience yet with COVID-19, but adverse effects on fetal brain development of most common coronaviruses are mitigated by higher choline levels. Maternal dietary supplementation of nutrients is a benign and inexpensive intervention in pregnancy to prevent life-long disability from mental illness. Use of dietary supplements in poorer, rural areas of China is below recommendations. Physicians, midwives, and public health officials in China can promote prenatal nutrient supplementation to reduce the future burden of mental illnesses that might be prevented before birth.","Li, Freedman","https://doi.org/10.1002/ped4.12199","20200828","Choline; Coronavirus; Folic acid; Omegaâ€3 fatty acids; Pregnancy; Vitamin D","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Combatting Social Isolation Among Older Adults in a Time of Physical Distancing: The COVID-19 Social Connectivity Paradox","Social isolation is an important public health issue that has gained recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the risks posed to older adults based on physical distancing. The primary purposes of this article are to provide an overview of the complex interconnectedness between social isolation, loneliness, and depression while introducing the COVID-19 Connectivity Paradox, a new concept used to describe the conflicting risk/harm continuum resulting from recommended physical distancing. In this context, examples will be provided for practical and feasible community-based models to improve social connectivity during COVID-19 by adjusting the processes and modalities used to deliver programs and services to older adults through the aging social services network. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for clinical and community-based organizations to unite and form inter-sectorial partnerships to maintain the provision of services and programs for engaging and supporting older adults during this difficult time of physical distancing and shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders. The aging social services network provides a vital infrastructure for reaching older underserved and/or marginalized persons across the U.S. to reduce social isolation. Capitalizing on existing practices in the field, older adults can achieve distanced connectivity to mitigate social isolation risk while remaining at safe physical distances from others.","Smith, Steinman, Casey","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00403","20200828","aging network; distanced connectivity; loneliness; paradox; screening; service provision; social connectivity; social isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychosocial Support for Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel corona virus disease COVID-19 was first diagnosed in humans in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Since then it had become a global pandemic. Such a pandemic leads to short- and long-term mental health burden for healthcare workers. Recent surveys suggest that rates of psychological stress, depression, anxiety, and insomnia and will be high for this group. Numerous organizations have since released guidance on how both healthcare workers and the general public can manage the mental health burden. However, these recommendations focus on specific healthcare workers (e.g., nurses or psychologists), are often not evidence-based, and typically do not situate guidance within a phased model that recognizes countries are at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this perspective paper we propose a phased model of mental health burden and responses. Building on work by the Intensive Care Society and the Royal College of Psychiatrists in the United Kingdom, we present a model that demonstrates how both staff and organizations might respond to the likely stressors that might occur at preparation-, pre-, initial and core-, and longer-term-phases of the pandemic. Staff within countries at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic will be able to use this model. We suggest practical tips for both healthcare workers and organizations and embed this within up-to-date scientific literature. The phased model of mental health burden and responses can be a helpful guide for both staff and organizations operating at different stages of the pandemic.","Tomlin, Dalgleish-Warburton, Lamph","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01960","20200828","COVID-19; Corona virus; healthcare; interventions; psychosocial support; staff","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How and When Does Inclusive Leadership Curb Psychological Distress During a Crisis? Evidence From the COVID-19 Outbreak","Traumatic events such as a pandemic shatter the assumption of the workplace as a safe place. Nurses face risks of life-threatening infection, which can create psychological distress. Quality of care for infected patients depends on mental well-being of nurses which calls for research on predictors of stress among health care workers. Responding to a call for research on the effects of leadership styles on psychological distress during traumatic events, this paper uses the theoretical lens of social exchange theory and contributes to literature on relationships between inclusive leadership, psychological distress, work engagement, and self-sacrifice. Participants of this cross sectional study included 497 registered nurses from five hospitals in Wuhan. Data were collected with temporal separation through an online questionnaire. Partial least-squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. Results show inclusive leadership has a significant negative relationship with psychological distress. Work engagement mediates this relationship, and nurses' self-sacrificial behavior moderates it. Findings indicate inclusive leadership style serves as a sustainable mechanism to reduce psychological distress during pandemics. It can operationalize the delivery of mental health support in real-time in work settings. Results provide empirical support for social exchange theory through high work engagement to help control psychological distress among nurses.","Ahmed, Zhao, Faraz","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01898","20200828","health care workers; inclusive leadership; mental health; psychological distress; self-sacrifice; social exchange theory; the COVID-19; work engagement","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Don't Walk So Close to Me: Physical Distancing and Adult Physical Activity in Canada","<b>Background</b>: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing measures have been implemented globally. Canadians have been instructed to stay at home, which has likely resulted in significant changes in their physical activity. Using data from a national physical activity tracking app (PAC app), we aimed to determine device-measured physical activity levels immediately prior to and following the implementation of physical distancing measures in Canada to provide evidence for the development of physical activity recommendations for future pandemics or second wave infections. <b>Methods</b>: Demographic and physical activity data were extracted from the ParticipACTION app (PAC app), using a 10-week (10 February to 19 April 2020) quasi-experimental design to determine changes in physical activity 4 weeks pre-pandemic and 6 weeks post-pandemic declaration. Weekly physical activity levels were monitored through wearable fitness trackers and health apps linked to the PAC app, to record moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), light physical activity (LPA), and steps. Repeated measure ANOVA was used to determine changes over time (mean Â± SE). <b>Findings</b>: A total of 2,338 Canadians who were mostly 35-44 years old (26.6%) and female (90.2%) were included in the analysis. MVPA, LPA, and steps significantly declined immediately following the declaration of the pandemic (MVPA: pre-pandemic: 194.2 Â± 5.2 min, post-pandemic: 176.7 Â± 5.0 min, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; LPA: pre-pandemic: 1,000.5 Â± 17.0 min, post-pandemic: 874.1 Â± 15.6 min, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; steps: pre-pandemic: 48,625 Â± 745 steps, post-pandemic: 43,395 Â± 705 steps, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). However, 6 weeks following pandemic declaration, MVPA (week 6: 204.4 Â± 5.4 min, <i>p</i> = 0.498) had returned to pre-pandemic levels. LPA (week 6: 732.0 Â± 14.3 min, <i>p</i> = &lt; 0.001) and steps (week 6: 41,946 Â± 763, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) remained significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels at week 6. <b>Interpretation</b>: Although MVPA returned to pre-pandemic levels, significant and sustained declines in incidental LPA and steps were observed. Attenuating the loss of incidental physical activity should be a public health priority in response to future pandemics or a second wave of a COVID-19 infection, as it may have significant long-term implications for the physical and mental health of Canadians.","Di Sebastiano, Chulak-Bozzer, Vanderloo, Faulkner","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01895","20200828","COVID-19; incidental physical activity; light physical activity; moderate to vigorous physical activity; pandemic; social distancing; steps","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence and Psychosocial Correlates of Mental Health Outcomes Among Chinese College Students During the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic","To investigate the prevalence and risk factors for poor mental health of Chinese university students during the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Chinese nation-wide on-line cross-sectional survey on university students, collected between February 12<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup>, 2020. Primary outcome was prevalence of clinically-relevant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Secondary outcomes on poor mental health included prevalence of clinically-relevant anxiety and depressive symptoms, while posttraumatic growth was considered as indicator of effective coping reaction. Of 2,500 invited Chinese university students, 2,038 completed the survey. Prevalence of clinically-relevant PTSD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, and post traumatic growth (PTG) was 30.8, 15.5, 23.3, and 66.9% respectively. Older age, knowing people who had been isolated, more ACEs, higher level of anxious attachment, and lower level of resilience all predicted primary outcome (all <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). A significant proportion of young adults exhibit clinically relevant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxious or depressive symptoms, but a larger portion of individuals showed to effectively cope with COVID-19 pandemic.

"COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown Measures Impact on Mental Health Among the General Population in Italy","The psychological impact of the COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and lockdown measures on the Italian population are unknown. The current study assesses rates of mental health outcomes in the Italian general population three to 4 weeks into lockdown measures and explores the impact of COVID-19 related potential risk factors. A web-based survey spread throughout the internet between March 27<sup>th</sup> and April 6<sup>th</sup> 2020. Eighteen thousand one hundred forty-seven individuals completed the questionnaire, 79.6% women. Selected outcomes were post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), depression, anxiety, insomnia, perceived stress, and adjustment disorder symptoms (ADS). Seemingly unrelated logistic regression analysis was performed to identify COVID-19 related risk factors. Endorsement rates for PTSS were 6,604 (37%), 3,084 (17.3%) for depression, 3,700 (20.8%) for anxiety, 1,301 (7.3%) for insomnia, 3,895 (21.8%) for high perceived stress and 4,092 (22.9%) for adjustment disorder. Being woman and younger age were associated with all of the selected outcomes. Quarantine was associated with PTSS, anxiety and ADS. Any recent COVID-related stressful life event was associated with all the selected outcomes. Discontinued working activity due to the COVID-19 was associated with all the selected outcomes, except for ADS; working more than usual was associated with PTSS, Perceived stress and ADS. Having a loved one deceased by COVID-19 was associated with PTSS, depression, perceived stress, and insomnia. We found high rates of negative mental health outcomes in the Italian general population 3 weeks into the COVID-19 lockdown measures and different COVID-19 related risk factors. These findings warrant further monitoring on the Italian population's mental health.","Rossi, Socci, Talevi, Mensi, Niolu, Pacitti, Di Marco, Rossi, Siracusano, Di Lorenzo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00790","20200828","anxiety; covid-19; depression; mental health; stress; trauma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Validation of the Impact of Event Scale With Modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19)","Viral outbreaks can be experienced as disruptive and can be associated with trauma-related stress symptoms. In the current study, we adjusted the Dutch version of the Impact of Event Scale (IES) to assess traumatic stress symptoms related to the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. The psychometric properties of this Impact of Event Scale with modifications for COVID-19 (IES-COVID19) were investigated by administering the IES-COVID19 to 380 university students who participated during the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak, upon invitation <i>via</i> e-mail. Using confirmatory factor analysis, the factor structure of the IES-COVID19 was found to be similar to the original IES, indicating two latent factors: intrusion and avoidance, <i>Ï‡<sup>2</sup></i> (85) = 147.51, CFI = .92, TLI = .90, RMSEA = .044, SRMR = .049. Cronbach's alpha showed acceptable internal consistency of the total IES-COVID19, <i>Î±</i> = .75. Pearson's correlations of the IES-COVID19 over time were also sufficient, demonstrating adequate test-retest reliability, <i>r</i> = .62. Significant correlations (ranging between .15 and .50) between the IES-COVID19 and symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, stress-related rumination, as well as negative social interactions, demonstrate adequate convergent validity. Overall, the IES-COVID19 shows to be a valid and reliable measure that can be utilized to investigate trauma-related stress symptoms of intrusion and avoidance related to the short- and long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Vanaken, Scheveneels, Belmans, Hermans","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00738","20200828","COVID-19; avoidance; confirmatory factor analysis; coronavirus; impact of event scale; intrusion; trauma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Cellular and Molecular Pathways of COVID-19 and Potential Points of Therapeutic Intervention","With the objective of linking early findings relating to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with potentially informative findings from prior research literature and to promote investigation toward therapeutic response, a coherent cellular and molecular pathway is proposed for COVID-19. The pathway is consistent with a broad range of observed clinical features and biological markers and captures key mediators of pathophysiology. In this proposed pathway, membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus <i>via</i> ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, including pulmonary type-II pneumocytes, provoke an initial immune response featuring inflammatory cytokine production coupled with a weak interferon response, particularly in IFN-Î»-dependent epithelial defense. Differentiation of non-classic pathogenic T-cells and pro-inflammatory intermediate monocytes contributes to a skewed inflammatory profile, mediated by membrane-bound immune receptor subtypes (e.g., Fc<i>Î³</i>RIIA) and downstream signaling pathways (e.g., NF-ÎºB p65 and p38 MAPK), followed by chemotactic infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils into lung tissue. Endothelial barrier degradation and capillary leakage contribute to alveolar cell damage. Inflammatory cytokine release, delayed neutrophil apoptosis, and NETosis contribute to pulmonary thrombosis and cytokine storm. These mechanisms are concordant with observed clinical markers in COVID-19, including high expression of inflammatory cytokines on the TNF-Î±/IL-6 axis, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), diffuse alveolar damage <i>via</i> cell apoptosis in respiratory epithelia and vascular endothelia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CRP, high production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), depressed platelet count, and thrombosis. Although certain elements are likely to be revised as new findings emerge, the proposed pathway suggests multiple points of investigation for potential therapeutic interventions. Initial candidate interventions include prophylaxis to augment epithelial defense (e.g., AT1 receptor blockade, type III and type I interferons, melatonin, calcitriol, camostat, and lopinavir) and to reduce viral load (e.g., remdesivir, ivermectin, emetine, Abelson kinase inhibitors, dopamine D2 antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor modulators). Additional interventions focus on tempering inflammatory signaling and injury (e.g., dexamethasone, doxycycline, Ang1-7, estradiol, alpha blockers, and DHA/EPA, pasireotide), as well as inhibitors targeted toward molecular mediators of the maladaptive COVID-19 immune response (e.g., IL-6, TNF-Î±, IL-17, JAK, and CDK9).","Hussman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01169","20200828","COVID-19; cytokines; immunity; signal transduction; therapeutics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Magnitude of Psychological Problem and Associated Factor in Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Among Communities Living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, March 2020: A Cross-Sectional Study Design","COVID-19 pandemic is a World Health Organization day-to-day work and has a significant crisis on the physical and mental health of humans. However, little is known about the mental health crisis of the pandemic in Sub-Saharan countries. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the magnitude of psychological problems and associated factors among communities living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 10 to 30, 2020. Data were collected from 420 respondents selected using a consecutive sampling technique. An online self-administered and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21) survey during the initial phase of the pandemic was conducted to assess the presence of psychological problems for the last two weeks in response to the infection. The magnitude of the psychological problem from moderate to severe levels was 66.4%. The predictor variables of the outcome were female gender, above the secondary level of education, monthly income below 3000 ETB, and more than three family size at 95% CI, P&lt;0.05. At the time of the initial COVID-19 pandemic in Ethiopia, nearly two-thirds of the respondents reported moderate to severe levels of psychological problems.

"Missouri's Fentanyl Problem: The China Connection","Recently, Missouri has followed an overall upward trend in opioid overdose deaths. In 2018, Missouri was the state with the largest absolute and percentage increase in opioid-related overdose fatality rates per capita over the previous year (18.3% and 3.1/100,000). This increase occurred despite an overall decrease in U.S. opioid-related death rates in the same period. This report identifies illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF) (and analogues) as the drug most responsible for this rise in opioid deaths in Missouri, with stimulant overdoses (primarily from methamphetamine) in second place. Within Missouri, we find the areas where opioid deaths are highest: St. Louis and the city's fringe areas, following the national trend for high rates in fringe areas. Based on reports from CDC Wonder data, county medical examiners, law enforcement agencies, and drug addiction prevention agencies, we conclude that IMF and related synthetic opioids arriving from China are primarily responsible for fatal narcotic overdoses in Missouri. Despite the COVID-19 disruption of fentanyl manufacturing and distribution centers in and around Wuhan, China early in the pandemic, preliminary 2020 data from medical examiners' offices show an upswing in opioid deaths, an indicator that Chinese fentanyl producers have restored the supply chain.","Stoecker, Bosworth, Rottnek","https://www.google.com/search?q=Missouri's+Fentanyl+Problem:+The+China+Connection.","20200902","Analgesics, Opioid; China; Drug Compounding; Drug Overdose; Drug Trafficking; Fentanyl; Humans; Missouri; Opioid Epidemic; Opioid-Related Disorders; Synthetic Drugs","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Do suicide rates in children and adolescents change during school closure in Japan? The acute effect of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted the lives of children and adolescents. School closure, one of the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in social contacts and increases in family time for children and adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of suicide is unknown. This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during school closure in Japan. Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020. Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020. Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also performed. We found no significant change in suicide rates during the school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month and school closure were not significant (p &gt; 0.1).

"Developing thinking around mental health science: the example of intrusive, emotional mental imagery after psychological trauma","One route to advancing psychological treatments is to harness mental health science, a multidisciplinary approach including individuals with lived experience and end users (e.g., Holmes, E.

While early days, we here illustrate a line of research explored by our group-intrusive imagery-based memories after trauma. We illustrate three possible approaches through which mental health science may stimulate thinking around psychological treatment innovation. First, focusing on single/specific target symptoms rather than full, multifaceted psychiatric diagnoses (e.g., intrusive trauma memories rather than all of posttraumatic stress disorder). Second, investigating mechanisms that can be <i>modified</i> in treatment (treatment mechanisms), rather than those which cannot (e.g., processes only linked to aetiology). Finally, exploring novel ways of delivering psychological treatment (peer-/self-administration), given the prevalence of mental health problems globally, and the corresponding need for effective interventions that can be delivered at scale and remotely for example at times of crisis (e.g., current COVID-19 pandemic). These three approaches suggest options for potential innovative avenues through which mental health science may be harnessed to recouple basic and applied research and transform treatment development.","Singh, Espinosa, Ji, Moulds, Holmes","https://doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2020.1804845","20200827","Mental health science; global mental health; intrusive memories of trauma; psychological treatments; remote delivery","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Productivity Commission's Draft Report illustrates the benefits and risks of economic perspectives on mental healthcare","In 2018, the Australian Government instructed the Productivity Commission to examine the social and economic effects of poor mental health, as well as make recommendations on how they might be addressed. The resulting Draft Report demonstrates both the benefits and risks of an economic approach to these issues. Some of the broader systemic recommendations have merit such as the need for stepped care, coordinated crisis management and the important role of welfare, housing and the workplace in improving mental health. However, there are areas of concern, particularly for mental health services in the public sector. One is a disproportionate emphasis on prevention and intervention in the early years of life for strategies where evidence for effectiveness is limited. Another is the introduction of market-based approaches such as shadow billing or a commissioner/provider split to the funding of mental health services across Australia. Among the numerous problems of such market-driven approaches are the increased costs of additional bureaucracy and the lack of commissioner expertise in planning services or evidence-based practice. As a result, similar arrangements have been abandoned in other jurisdictions. The Commission's final recommendations and the Australian Government's response are awaited and the resulting changes to the mental health system, and beyond, may well be influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, reform should be based on evidence and achieved without increasing administrative complexity.","Kisely, Looi","https://doi.org/10.1177/0004867420951255","20200827","Public mental health services; commissioning; purchaser/provider split; youth mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Hâ€³ITâ€³ting the Barriers for Exercising during Social Isolation","Aerobic exercise is traditionally recommended to improve general health and prevent many non-communicable diseases. However, the measures adopted to control the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak culminated with closing of exercise facilities and fitness centers and, as a primary consequence, impaired aerobic exercise practice. This contributed to an increase in risk factors associated with physical inactivity such as insulin resistance, high blood pressure, low-grade inflammation, weight gain, and mental health problems. The scenario is worrisome, and it is important to propose alternatives for exercise practice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interval training (IT) emerges as an exercise mode that might be feasible, low-cost, and potentially safe to be performed in many different places. IT consists of interspersing relative brief bouts of high-intensity exercise with recovery periods and promotes similar or greater health benefits when compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise. Among the different types of IT, sprint interval training and &quot;Tabata protocols&quot; might be particularly useful during social isolation. These protocols can be controlled and performed without the need of complex equipment and can be adapted to different places, including domestic environments. In this article, we present variations of IT as possible alternatives to cope physical inactivity during COVID-19 pandemics with a focus on its practical applications. The protocols suggested can be performed without the need of specialized equipment or facilities, in a time-efficient manner, and aiming to prevent detraining or even improve physical fitness and general health.","Souza, Coswig, de Lira, Gentil","https://doi.org/10.3390/biology9090245","20200827","COVID-19; aerobic exercise; calisthenics; high-intensity interval training; immunity; intermittent exercise","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Asia Pacific Disaster Mental Health Network: Setting a Mental Health Agenda for the Region","Addressing the psychological mechanisms and structural inequalities that underpin mental health issues is critical to recovery following disasters and pandemics. The Asia Pacific Disaster Mental Health Network was established in June 2020 in response to the current disaster climate and to foster advancements in disaster-oriented mental health research, practice and policy across the region. Supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) Thematic Platform for Health Emergency and Disaster Risk Management (Health EDRM), the network brings together leading disaster psychiatry, psychology and public health experts. Our aim is to advance policy, research and targeted translation of the evidence so that communities are better informed in preparation and response to disasters, pandemics and mass trauma. The first meetings of the network resulted in the development of a regional disaster mental health agenda focused on the current context, with five priority areas: (1) Strengthening community engagement and the integration of diverse perspectives in planning, implementing and evaluating mental health and psychosocial response in disasters; (2) Supporting and assessing the capacity of mental health systems to respond to disasters; (3) Optimising emerging technologies in mental healthcare; (4) Understanding and responding appropriately to addressing the mental health impacts of climate change; (5) Prioritising mental health and psychosocial support for high-risk groups. Consideration of these priority areas in future research, practice and policy will support nuanced and effective psychosocial initiatives for disaster-affected populations within the Asia Pacific region.","Newnham, Dzidic, Mergelsberg, Guragain, Chan, Kim, Leaning, Kayano, Wright, Kaththiriarachchi, Kato, Osawa, Gibbs","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176144","20200828","Asia Pacific; COVID-19; Health EDRM; disaster; mental health; psychosocial","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Epidemiological and clinical features of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha city, Hunan, China","In December 2019, a cluster of coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The present study was conducted to report the clinical characteristics of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, a city outside of Wuhan. All of the patients with confirmed COVID-19 were admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha City, the designated hospital for COVID-19 assigned by the Changsha City Government. The clinical and epidemiological characteristics, data of laboratory, radiological picture, treatment, and outcomes records of 201 COVID-19 patients were collected using electronic medical records. This study population consisted of 201 hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Changsha by April 28, 2020. The median age of the patients was 45 years (IQR 34-59). About half (50.7%) of the patients were male, and most of the infected patients were staff (96 [47.8%]). Concerning the epidemiologic history, the number of patients linked to Wuhan was 92 (45.8%). The most common symptoms were fever (125 [62.2%]), dry cough (118 [58.7%]), fatigue (65 [32.3%]), and pharyngalgia (31 [15.4%]). One hundred and forty-four (71.6%) enrolled patients showed bilateral pneumonia. Fifty-four (26.9%) patients showed unilateral involvement, and three (1.5%) patients showed no abnormal signs or symptoms. The laboratory findings differed significantly between the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and non-ICU groups. Compared with non-ICU patients, ICU patients had depressed white blood cell (WBC), neutrocytes, lymphocytes, and prolonged prothrombin time (PT). Moreover, higher plasma levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase (ALA), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), creatinine (CREA), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were detected in the ICU group. In this single-center study of 201 COVID-19 patients in Changsha, China, 22.4% of patients were admitted to ICU. Based on our findings, we propose that the risk of cellular immune deficiency, hepatic injury, and kidney injury should be monitored. Previous reports focused on the clinical features of patients from Wuhan, China. With the global epidemic of COVID-19, we should pay more attention to the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients outside of Wuhan.","Zhou, Sun, Cao, Wang, Huang, Zheng, Xie, Jiang, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000021824","20200827",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Depression and anxiety among university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: A web-based cross-sectional survey","The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also aimed at identifying the determinants of depression and anxiety. A total of 476 university students living in Bangladesh participated in this cross-sectional web-based survey. A standardized e-questionnaire was generated using the Google Form, and the link was shared through social media-Facebook. The information was analyzed in three consecutive levels, such as univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis. Students were experiencing heightened depression and anxiety. Around 15% of the students reportedly had moderately severe depression, whereas 18.1% were severely suffering from anxiety. The binary logistic regression suggests that older students have greater depression (OR = 2.886, 95% CI = 0.961-8.669). It is also evident that students who provided private tuition in the pre-pandemic period had depression (OR = 1.199, 95% CI = 0.736-1.952). It is expected that both the government and universities could work together to fix the academic delays and financial problems to reduce depression and anxiety among university students.","Islam, Barna, Raihan, Khan, Hossain","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238162","20200831","Adolescent; Anxiety; Bangladesh; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Association of social-economic changes due to COVID 19 with health outcomes in patients with skin diseases","The outbreak of COVID-19 has profoundly influenced the lifestyle of the public, while the impacts varied across subgroups of people. The pandemic-related impacts on health outcomes of skin diseases are unknown. To study the association of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts with health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases. This was a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with skin diseases. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (isolation status, income change and employment status) were collected. The main outcomes included perceived stress (visual analog scale), symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) and depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), quality of life (Dermatology Life Quality Index), and health utility mapping from the EQ-5D-3L. Multivariable logistic regression was used to investigate the associations. A total of 506 patients with skin diseases accomplished the survey. The mean age of the patients was 33.5Â±14.0 years, and 42.9% (217/506) were male. Among them, 25.3% were quarantined, 20.2% reported unemployment, and 62.7% reported decrease or loss of income since the pandemic. The pandemic-related impacts were significantly associated with impaired mental-wellbeing and quality of life with different effect. Unemployment and complete loss of income were associated with the highest risks of adverse outcomes, with 110% to 162% increase in the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and impaired quality of life. Isolation, income loss, and unemployment are associated with the impaired health-related quality of life in patients with skin diseases since the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Shen, Zhang, Xiao, Zhao, Yin, Bu, Wang, Chen, Su","https://doi.org/10.2196/22288","20200826",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Impacts Mental Health Outcomes and Ability/Desire to Participate in Research Among Current Research Participants","Examine COVID-19 impact on current research participants' mental health outcomes, ability to adhere to behavioral intervention recommendations, and desire to participate in research. Quantitative/qualitative cross-sectional survey among adults currently enrolled in health-related research (n=250; 85% women; &gt;50% currently enrolled in behavioral weight loss intervention). COVID-19 is perceived as a severe threat by most (62.3%). Related to COVID-19, 29.6% of participants reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety/depression and 68.4% reported moderate/severe PTSD symptomatology, with women more likely to demonstrate moderate/severe anxiety/depression (p=0.047) and PTSD symptomatology (p=0.028) relative to men. Those with moderate/severe levels of anxiety/depression (p=0.0154) and distress (p=0.0330) were more likely to report decreased desire to participate in research. Among those in behavioral interventions, individuals perceiving COVID-19 as a moderate/severe threat or experiencing moderate/severe depression or PTSD symptomatology were 4-19 times more likely to report COVID-19 affected their ability to adhere to behavioral recommendations. Qualitative analysis identified four themes describing COVID-19 impact on research experiences: transition; remote intervention delivery; ability to adhere to program goals; research participation interest. These data suggest participants engaged in health-related research perceive COVID-19 as a significant threat, affecting mental health, desire to participate in research, and ability to adhere to intervention recommendations.","Cardel, Manasse, Krukowski, Ross, Shakour, Miller, Lemas, Hong","https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.23016","20200903","behavioral science; clinical research; epidemiology; outcomes; psychology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Effect of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on Pediatric Resident Well-Being","This study aims to identify factors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic that affect resident physicians' well-being, identify potential sources of anxiety, and assess for depression and stress among residents. A cross-sectional survey was performed in April 2020 that evaluated resident perceptions about COVID-19 pandemic, its impact on their personal lifestyle, and coping mechanisms adopted. The respondents also completed the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and Cohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Of 37 residents, 29 completed the survey for a response rate of 78%. We found that 50% of residents harbored increased anxiety due to the pandemic and reported fears of spreading disease. Factors that negatively impacted their well-being included social isolation from colleagues (78%), inability to engage in outdoor activities (82%), and social gatherings (86%). Residents expressed concern about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on their didactic education and clinical rotations. The mean PSS-10 total score was 17 (SD = 4.96, range = 0-33) and the mean BDI-II total score was 6.79 (SD = 6.00). Our residents adopted a number of coping mechanisms in response to COVID-19. We identified factors specific to the COVID-19 pandemic that adversely affected resident physician well-being. Trainees were concerned about the risk of developing COVID-19 and spreading this to their family. Residents also harbored anxiety regarding the effect of COVID-19 on their education. Lifestyle changes including social isolation also resulted in a negative effect on resident well-being.

"The impacts of a COVID-19 epidemic focus and general belief in a just world on individual emotions","Whether the general belief in a just world (GBJW) can protect individual emotions during a major disaster is a matter of debate. This study conducted two experiments to explore this question during the COVID-19 epidemic. Experiment 1 (<i>N</i>â€¯=â€¯92, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>â€¯=â€¯22.52, 48.91% was male) manipulated the focus regarding the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate the impact of this focus on participants' emotions. The results showed that compared with the nonepidemic focus group, the epidemic focus group had higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions. Experiment 2 (<i>N</i>â€¯=â€¯200, <i>M</i><sub>age</sub>â€¯=â€¯23.91, 49% was male) manipulated the epidemic focus and GBJW to investigate their effects on the participants' emotions. The results showed that high levels of GBJW reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions regardless of whether the participants were focused on the epidemic. This study expands the influence of the GBJW on individual emotions and finds that the GBJW can protect individuals' emotions when they face a major social disaster. These findings imply that controlling people's intake of information on the epidemic can avoid their suffering from the vicarious traumatization caused by epidemic-related information overload and that improving the public's GBJW protects their mental health during an epidemic.","Wang, Wang, Liu, Yang, Zheng, Bai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110349","20200827","Epidemic focus; General belief in a just world (GBJW); Individual emotions; Psychological stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"[Adaptations of an outpatient Dialectical Behavioral Therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic and consequences of the confinement on patients with borderline personality disorder]","<i>Background:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the accessibility of psychotherapy for particularly vulnerable patients during the period of confinement in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. We had to adapt our usual therapeutic programs. We illustrate this approach in an outpatient program of dialectical behavioral therapy for patients with borderline personality disorder. Each week the individual therapies took place by videoconference or phone. The skills training group was held individually by videoconference or phone and was supported by an online skills training program. Patients filled out their diary cards online. Intersession contact with the therapist remained available as usual and we could organize team consultation. The aim of this study is to describe how a sample of our patients experienced the period of confinement.<i>Method:</i> We compared the experiences of seven patients suffering from borderline personality disorder during two periods: eight weeks prior to confinement, and during the eight weeks of confinement. We analyzed their daily diary cards (n = 426) and their weekly frequency of problem behaviors (n = 69). We performed multilevel analyses to take into account the hierarchical structure of the data and the autocorrelation of observations.<i>Results:</i> The seven patients were predominantly female (85.7â€‰%) and had an average age of 35.1 (11.5) years. Measurements prior to the start of the pandemic indicated on average severe depression (Beck Depression Inventory, m = 30.9 (10.0)) and marked hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale, m = 15.0 (5.0)). Analysis of the daily diary cards indicated that the confinement period significantly predicted a decrease in feelings of shame or guilt, fear and tension. At the same time, however, there was an increase in distress. Weekly monitoring of problem behaviors showed a decrease in binge-eating behaviors and a trend towards a decrease in alcohol consumption during confinement.<i>Conclusions:</i> Despite the small number of patients included, two types of repeated measurements indicated convergent results, with some improvements during confinement: a decrease of the feelings of fear, shame or guilt, and tension, and a decrease of the frequency of binge-eating behaviors. The decreased pace of daily social and professional life may explain these improvements. The diminution of the above-mentioned feelings as triggers for addictive and compulsive behaviors may also account for the improvements regarding binge-eating. However, they also experienced an increased distress that may reflect the loneliness experienced during this period. The pre-pandemic development of computerized tools that were already familiar to patients greatly facilitated the necessary adaptations to maintain an intensive therapeutic setting during the confinement. This may partly explain why these patients were able to adjust the challenges of this period.","Salamin, Rossier, Joye, Nolde, Pierrehumbert, Gothuey, Guenot","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.08.006","20200826","Borderline personality disorder; Confinement; Coronavirus; Dialectical behavior therapies; Pandemic; Psychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

We present a rare case of fulminant COVID-19 associated with reverse-takotsubo-cardiomyopathy (RTCC) that improved with therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). A 40 year old previous healthy male presented in the emergency room with 4 days of dry cough, chest pain, myalgias and fatigue. He progressed to ARF requiring high-flow-nasal-cannula (flow: 60â€‰L/minute, fraction of inspired oxygen: 40%). Real-Time-Polymerase-Chain-Reaction (RT-PCR) assay confirmed COVID-19 and chest X-ray showed interstitial infiltrates. Biochemistry suggested CRS: increased C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin and interleukin-6. Renal function was normal but lactate levels were elevated. Electrocardiogram demonstrated non-specific changes and troponin-I levels were slightly elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular (LV) basal and midventricular akinesia with apex sparing (LV ejection fraction: 30%) and depressed cardiac output (2.8â€‰L/min) consistent with a rare variant of stress-related cardiomyopathy: RTCC. His ratio of partial arterial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired concentration of oxygen was &lt;â€‰120. He was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for mechanical ventilation and vasopressors, plus antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir), and prophylactic anticoagulation. Infusion of milrinone failed to improve his cardiogenic shock (day-1). Thus, rescue TPE was performed using the Spectra Optiaâ„¢ Apheresis System equipped with the Depuro D2000 Adsorption Cartridge (Terumo BCT Inc., USA) without protective antibodies. Over 5 days he received daily TPE (each lasting 4 hours). His lactate levels, oxygenation, and LV function normalized and he was weaned off vasopressors. His inflammation markers improved, and he was extubated on day-7. RT-PCR was negative on day-17. He was discharged to home isolation in good condition. Stress-cardiomyopathy may complicate the course of fulminant COVID-19 with associated CRS. If inotropic therapy fails, TPE without protective antibodies may help rescue the critically ill patient.","Faqihi, Alharthy, Alshaya, Papanikolaou, Kutsogiannis, Brindley, Karakitsos","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01665-0","20200903","COVID-19; Cardiogenic shock; Case-report; Cytokine release syndrome; Echocardiography; Reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy; Therapeutic plasma exchange; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Cardiotonic Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Drug Combinations; Echocardiography; Humans; Lopinavir; Male; Pandemics; Plasma Exchange; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; Ritonavir; Shock, Cardiogenic; Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Physical activity and nutrition guidelines to help with the fight against COVID-19","As the world is witnessing the epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019, emerging genetics and clinical pieces of evidence suggest a similar immunopathology to those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. Staying at home to prevent the spread of the virus and consequently being largely inactive is associated with unintended consequences. These can actually enhance the infection risk and exacerbate poor health conditions including impaired immune function. Physical activity is a feasible way of improving health, particularly physical and mental health in a time of social isolation. However, people with certain health conditions in these circumstances may need a special physical activity programme in addition to any exercise they may already be performing via online programmes. This review aims to provide practical guidelines during the COVID-19 quarantine period. We suggest performing aerobic, resistance training, respiratory muscle training and yoga in the healthy, and in those with upper respiratory tract illness, patients with lower respiratory tract illness should be restricted to respiratory muscle training and yoga. In addition, vitamins D and C, omega-3 fatty acids, and regular consumption of fruit and vegetables might be considered as nutritional aids to support the immune system in those affected by COVID-19.","Khoramipour, Basereh, Hekmatikar, Castell, Ruhee, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2020.1807089","20200826","Coronavirus; exercise; immune response; nutrition; respiratory muscle training","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

A total of 874 neuropsychology trainees (81% female) completed the 69-item survey. Of the included trainees, 48% were doctoral students, 17% were interns, and 35% were postdoctoral residents (50% of resident respondents were in their first year). The majority of neuropsychology trainees reported some impact of the pandemic on their professional and/or personal life. Overall, the impact did not differ by training level, geographic location, or demographic factors. Trainees' primary professional concerns included uncertainty about the impact of the pandemic on their professional future, loss of clinical hours, and desire for increased and ongoing communication from their leadership. A notable percentage of trainees reported increased personal mental health symptoms (i.e. anxiety/depression; 74%/54%), as well as a number of other personal stressors. Despite the transition to telehealth (mostly interviews/feedback sessions), few trainees have prior training or experience in providing neuropsychological services via phone or video platform. A limited proportion of trainees (approximately 10%) were still seeing patients face-to-face for neuropsychological evaluations during the COVID-19 pandemic as of 14 April 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting neuropsychological training and the well-being of trainees. This survey highlights the importance of communication with trainees during uncertain times. Based on the survey results, recommendations were developed to assist neuropsychology organizations in developing initiatives to support trainees during the current pandemic and in the future.","Guidotti Breting, Towns, Butts, Brett, Leaffer, Whiteside","https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2020.1809712","20200826","COVID-19; education; neuropsychology trainees; pandemic; survey","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Eating disorders in times of the COVID-19 pandemic-Results from an online survey of patients with anorexia nervosa","The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting public restrictions pose a psychological burden for humans worldwide and may be particularly detrimental for individuals with mental disorders. Therefore, the current study explored effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on eating disorder (ED) symptoms and other psychological aspects in former inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN). One-hundred and fifty-nine patients with AN-discharged from inpatient treatment in 2019-completed an online survey on contact history with COVID-19, changes in ED symptoms and other psychological aspects, health care utilization, and strategies patients employed to cope during the pandemic. Approximately 70% of patients reported that eating, shape and weight concerns, drive for physical activity, loneliness, sadness, and inner restlessness increased during the pandemic. Access to in-person psychotherapies and visits at the general practitioner (including weight checks) decreased by 37% and 46%, respectively. Videoconference therapy was used by 26% and telephone contacts by 35% of patients. Patients experienced daily routines, day planning and enjoyable activities as the most helpful among the most used coping strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic poses great challenges to patients with AN. ED-related thoughts and behaviors may be used as dysfunctional coping mechanisms to regain control over the current circumstances. E-mental health interventions appear to be promising for supporting AN patients during these hard times. Furthermore, interventions addressing symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as intolerance of uncertainty might help them manage their ED symptoms.","Schlegl, Maier, Meule, Voderholzer","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23374","20200903","COVID-19 pandemic; anorexia nervosa; coping strategies; health care utilization; symptoms worsening","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 Is Straining Mental Health-Could Technology Be the Answer?","One of the most pernicious side effects of the COVID-19 pandemic is a steep rise in stress and mental health problems. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly half of American adults say that worry and stress about the pandemic is hurting their mental health [1]. There are plenty of factors feeding into this phenomenon. People are anxious about getting sick, grieving lost loved ones, and experiencing financial stress, parental stress, and loneliness. The pandemic places additional burdens on essential workers and people of color, both of whom are at greater risk of dying from the disease.

"Pain Management During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Chronic pain management during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenging process, especially with growing evidence that COVID-19 infection is associated with myalgias, referred pain, and widespread hyperalgesia. In light of the limited data available for COVID-19-related impact on chronic pain patients, this review explores the changes in the healthcare delivery system due to social distancing and safety precautions to provide the appropriate management of chronic pain patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding both the general problems facing chronic pain patients as well as specific problems in the COVID-19 era including deconditioning, increased mental health concerns, financial burdens, and potential for medication-induced immune-suppression is vital in the appropriate management of patients. Telemedicine, the practice of caring for patients remotely when the provider and patient are not physically present with each other, is becoming increasingly used and recognized as a valuable tool to both health care providers and patients. This paper concentrates on the proper utilization of the available resources to help patients with the most severe conditions as well as the most vulnerable group. COVID-19 may be associated with a profound effect on both the health care system and patients with chronic pain. As a result, delaying, or stopping, treatment for chronic pain patients will have negative consequences, and strong pain evaluations must be administered to triage patients appropriately. Recent recommendations for the safe use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and interventional pain management procedures are vital to know and understand specifically during the pandemic era. Further researches are needed to identify the advance planning and rapid responses to reduce the impact of the pandemic.","El-Tallawy, Nalamasu, Pergolizzi, Gharibo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40122-020-00190-4","20200827","COVID-19 pandemic; Interventional pain management; Pain management; Personal protective equipment (PPE); Systemic analgesics; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Rehabilitation of patients post-COVID-19 infection: a literature review","Rehabilitation is important for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Given the lack of guidelines in English on the rehabilitation of these patients, we conducted a review of the most recent reports. We performed this literature review using the principal research databases and included randomized trials, recommendations, quasi-randomized or prospective controlled clinical trials, reports, guidelines, field updates, and letters to the editor. We identified 107 studies in the database search, among which 85 were excluded after screening the full text or abstract. In total, 22 studies were finally included. The complexity of the clinical setting and the speed of spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which leads to rapid occupation of beds in the intensive care unit, make it necessary to discharge patients with COVID-19 who have mild symptoms as soon as possible. For these reasons, it is necessary to formulate rehabilitation programs for these patients, to help them restore physical and respiratory function and to reduce anxiety and depression, particularly patients with comorbidities and those who live alone or in rural settings, to restore a good quality of life.","Demeco, Marotta, Barletta, Pino, Marinaro, Petraroli, Moggio, Ammendolia","https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520948382","20200831","Rehabilitation; coronavirus disease 2019; intensive care; physical function; respiratory function; review; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Discharge; Patient Discharge Summaries; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Neurological manifestations of COVID-19: available evidences and a new paradigm","The recent pandemic outbreak of coronavirus is pathogenic and a highly transmittable viral infection caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). In this time of ongoing pandemic, many emerging reports suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 has inimical effects on neurological functions, and even causes serious neurological damage. The neurological symptoms associated with COVID-19 include headache, dizziness, depression, anosmia, encephalitis, stroke, epileptic seizures, and Guillain-Barre syndrome along with many others. The involvement of the CNS may be related with poor prognosis and disease worsening. Here, we review the evidence of nervous system involvement and currently known neurological manifestations in COVID-19 infections caused by SARS-CoV-2. We prioritize the 332 human targets of SARS-CoV-2 according to their association with brain-related disease and identified 73 candidate genes. We prioritize these 73 genes according to their spatio-temporal expression in the different regions of brain and also through evolutionary intolerance analysis. The prioritized genes could be considered potential indicators of COVID-19-associated neurological symptoms and thus act as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of CNS manifestations associated with COVID-19 patients.","Khatoon, Prasad, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13365-020-00895-4","20200827","COVID-19; Gene enrichment; Gene prioritization; Neurological damage; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Psychiatric Emergency Department Visits - A Descriptive Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (COVID-19) has an important direct and indirect impact on both physical and mental health. We aim to describe the impact of an emergency state period due to COVID-19 on psychiatric emergency department (ED) visits. We conducted a retrospective observational study analysing all emergency visits occurring at a metropolitan psychiatric ED between March 19th and May 2nd 2019 and 2020 (the beginning/end date of the emergency state which Portugal was under due to COVID-19). Data regarding age, sex, diagnoses, admission date, discharge destiny and status were collected. Diagnoses were classified using the International Classification of Diseases version 9, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). There was a 52Â·2% decrease on the number of psychiatric emergency visits during the emergency state period (n<sub>2020</sub>â€‰=â€‰780 vs n<sub>2019</sub>â€‰=â€‰1633 episodes). The decrease on psychiatric ED visits was greater in the female sex and in the younger age groups. Episodes with a primary diagnosis of Mood disorders lead the decrease on psychiatric ED visits with 68Â·3% less episodes. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders was the diagnosis group with the smaller decline (9Â·8% decrease). COVID-19 emergency state period had an important impact on the number and characteristics of psychiatric ED visits, reinforcing the great indirect effects of COVID-19 on mental health.","GonÃ§alves-Pinho, Mota, Ribeiro, Macedo, Freitas","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09837-z","20200827","Administrative database; Emergency service; Mental health; Pandemics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

We analyzed 625 serial plasma samples from 40 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and 170 SARS-CoV-2-infected outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. Severely ill patients developed significantly higher SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses than outpatients and asymptomatic individuals. The development of plasma antibodies was correlated with decreases in viral RNAemia, consistent with potential humoral immune clearance of virus. Using a novel competition ELISA, we detected antibodies blocking RBD-ACE2 interactions in 68% of inpatients and 40% of outpatients tested. Cross-reactive antibodies recognizing SARS-CoV RBD were found almost exclusively in hospitalized patients. Outpatient and asymptomatic individuals' serological responses to SARS-CoV-2 decreased within 2 months, suggesting that humoral protection may be short-lived.","RÃ¶ltgen, Wirz, Stevens, Powell, Hogan, Najeeb, Hunter, Sahoo, Huang, Yamamoto, Manalac, Otrelo-Cardoso, Pham, Rustagi, Rogers, Shah, Blish, Cochran, Nadeau, Jardetzky, Zehnder, Wang, Kim, Gombar, Tibshirani, Pinsky, Boyd","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.15.20175794","20200827",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How <i>Î¼</i> -Opioid Receptor Recognizes Fentanyl","The opioid crisis has escalated during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than half of the overdose-related deaths are related to synthetic opioids represented by fentanyl which is a potent agonist of mu-opioid receptor (mOR). In recent years, crystal structures of mOR complexed with morphine derivatives have been determined; however, structural basis of mOR activation by fentanyl-like synthetic opioids remains lacking. Exploiting the X-ray structure of mOR bound to a morphinan ligand and several state-of-the-art simulation techniques, including weighted ensemble and continuous constant pH molecular dynamics, we elucidated the detailed binding mechanism of fentanyl with mOR. Surprisingly, in addition to the orthosteric site common to morphinan opiates, fentanyl can move deeper and bind mOR through hydrogen bonding with a conserved histidine H297, which has been shown to modulate mOR's ligand affinity and pH dependence in mutagenesis experiments, but its precise role remains unclear. Intriguingly, the secondary binding mode is only accessible when H297 adopts a neutral HID tautomer. Alternative binding modes and involvement of tautomer states may represent general mechanisms in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-ligand recognition. Our work provides a starting point for understanding mOR activation by fentanyl analogs that are emerging at a rapid pace and assisting the design of safer analgesics to combat the opioid crisis. Current protein simulation studies employ standard protonation and tautomer states; our work demonstrates the need to move beyond the practice to advance our understanding of protein-ligand recognition.","Vo, Mahinthichaichan, Shen, Ellis","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.16.253013","20200827",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

In order to promote psychological resilience during this time, it is important to understand modifiable targets for clinical intervention. The current study examined demographic characteristics, pandemic-related adversity, and psychological flexibility in relation to general and peritraumatic distress in a sample of United States survey respondents during May of 2020. Participants were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), <i>N</i>Â =Â 485. Participants completed measures of pandemic-related adversity, psychological flexibility components (openness to experience, behavioral awareness, and valued action), peritraumatic distress, and general distress. Hierarchical regression analyses examined whether demographic characteristics, pandemic-related adversity, and components of psychological flexibility were associated with general and peritraumatic distress. Results indicated that higher pandemic-related adversity, lower openness to experience, and lower behavioral awareness were significantly associated with higher general distress. Greater pandemic-related adversity, lower openness to experience, lower behavioral awareness, and higher valued action were significantly associated with higher peritraumatic distress. Adding the components of psychological flexibility to the model increased the amount of variance accounted for in both measures of distress. The results indicated that psychological flexibility components may be particularly important targets for prevention and intervention efforts in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Transdiagnostic interventions, such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, that target psychological flexibility may be useful as the impact of the pandemic continues to unfold.","Kroska, Roche, Adamowicz, Stegall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.011","20200831","Awareness; COVID-19; Distress; Engagement; Openness; Pandemic adversity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The majority of the participants were from Erbil (58.8%), most of them were male (58.4%); nearly 21.2% preferred quarantine and 41.7% chose curfew as a best way to to avoid being infected by COVID-19. Most of the participants had depression because of people's lack of knowledge about how to protect themselves from the virus (88.14%), while the majority of them had anxiety concerning shopping and contact with infected people (97%) and financial problems (97%). Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than did males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was no significant association between other variables and depression and anxiety. The findings of the study indicated that the majority of participants were depressed and had anxiety about COVID-19. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety.","Blbas, Aziz, Nejad, Barzinjy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01325-9","20200827","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Kurdistan Region of Iraq; Population","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Stress and burnout in health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic: validation of a questionnaire","To validate a questionnaire to assess stress and burnout in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, content validity, Cronbach's alpha, and test-retest reliability method were utilized among 60 HCWs to evaluate the validity, internal consistency, and reliability of the questionnaire respectively. The final questionnaire was composed of four parts asking for the background information, questions about the stress caused by the COVID-19, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), and six questions from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). The CVR of 46 questions was equal to 1, making them acceptably valid (CVRâ€‰&gt;â€‰0.78), so that the items could be arranged into a final questionnaire. Moreover, all items could successfully attain CVI values above 0.79, confirming the content validity of the questionnaire. The Cronbach's alpha was between 0.80-0.95 for different sections of questionaire, confirming the stable reliability and high repeatability of the questionnaire. The results of this study showed that the DASS-21 offers adequate levels of validity and reliability for assessing the stress, anxiety, and depression among the HCWs engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the six items adapted from the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI) were found to provide a good instrument for investigating the job burnout among the HCWs at Masih Daneshvari Hospital during the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Talaee, Varahram, Jamaati, Salimi, Attarchi, Kazempour Dizaji, Sadr, Hassani, Farzanegan, Monjazebi, Seyedmehdi","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01313-z","20200827","Burn out; COVID-19; DASS 21; Healthcare workers; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Research on the individualized short-term training model of nurses in emergency isolation wards during the outbreak of COVID-19","To explore an effective personalized training model for nurses working in emergency isolation wards of COVID-19 in a short period. This study is a longitudinal study from 24 January 2020 to 28 February 2020. There are 71 nursing staff working in the emergency isolation wards of Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital that participated in this study. The questionnaires were conducted with Likert scale. The operation assessment teachers have received standardized training. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression Scale (SDS) were applied to assess the mental state of nurses. After short-term training, these nurses can handle the emergency tasks in a timely manner. The pass rate of nurse theory and operation assessment is 100%. The 111 suspected patients admitted to the emergency isolation ward have been scientifically diagnosed and treated, the three confirmed patients have received appropriate treatment. No nurses have been infected. In this study, the personalized emergency training mode was feasible in the emergency isolation ward during the COVID-19 epidemic, which rapidly improved the rescue ability of nurses and effectively avoid the occurrence of cross-infection. This mode can provide a valuable reference for the emergency training of nurses in the future.","Zhou, Yuan, Zhao, Xi, Wen, Zeng, Zeng, Wu, Zeng, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1002/nop2.580","20200827","COVIDâ€19; isolation; nurses; nursing; training","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mindful Parenting: A Behavioral Tool for Parent Well-Being","Parents often suffer from conditions such as stress and depression due to the high demands of parenting. In particular, parenting children with some form of developmental disability may bring about increased maladaptive behaviors that may increase daily parenting stressors. The fast-spreading repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic have left millions of parents across the globe to deal with various stressors in isolation. Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of mindfulness as an intervention for targeting individuals' behaviors such as aggression, self-injurious behavior, and noncompliance while increasing overall well-being and happiness levels. Significant decreases in target behaviors are noted across studies, as well as increases in parent satisfaction and well-being. This study reviews the use of mindfulness within the scope of behavior analysis as a tool that can be quickly implemented to support parents not only through this crisis but also throughout parenthood in general.","Fuller, Fitter","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40617-020-00447-6","20200827","COVID-19; behavior reduction; mindfulness; parent training; parent well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Relative bradycardia as a clinical feature in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A report of two cases","We treated two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Case 1 was a 73-year-old Japanese man. Computed tomography (CT) revealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs. He had severe respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio (P/F ratio) of 203. Electrocardiogram showed a heart rate (HR) of 56Â beats/min, slight ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF, and mild saddle-back type ST elevation in leads V1 and V2. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level was slightly elevated. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, his HR remained within 50-70Â beats/min. Case 2 was a 52-year-old Japanese woman. CT revealed ground-glass opacities in the lower left lung. Electrocardiogram showed a HR of only 81Â beats/min, despite a body temperature of 39.2Â Â°C, slight ST depression in leads V4, V5, V6, and a prominent U wave in multiple leads. She had an elevated cTnT and a P/F ratio of 165. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, her HR remained within 50-70Â beats/min. Both patients had a poor compensatory increase in their HR, despite their critical status. Relative bradycardia could be a cardiovascular complication and is an important clinical finding in patients with COVID-19. &lt;<b>Learning objective:</b> We report two Japanese cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with relative bradycardia as a condition and no significant compensatory increase in heart rate despite high fever and severe hypoxemia. Relative bradycardia in COVID-19 might be associated with myocardial injury due to not only direct viral involvement but also systemic inflammation. We should carefully observe the occurrence of relative bradycardia because it could potentially be a clinical sign of COVID-19.&gt;.","Hiraiwa, Goto, Nakamura, Yasuda, Sakai, Kasugai, Jinno, Tanaka, Ogawa, Higashi, Yamamoto, Jingushi, Ozaki, Numaguchi, Kondo, Morimoto, Okumura, Matsuda, Murohara","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jccase.2020.07.015","20200827","Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Myocardial injury; Relative bradycardia; Severe acute respiratory syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Do Quarantine Experiences and Attitudes Towards COVID-19 Affect the Distribution of Mental Health in China? A Quantile Regression Analysis","While quarantine has become a widely used control strategy during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), empirical research on whether and to what extent quarantine and attitudes towards COVID-19 affect mental health is scant. Using a cross-sectional online survey, this paper is the first from the Chinese outbreak to investigate how quarantine experiences and attitudes towards COVID-19 are related to mental health, and how these relationships change across the distribution of mental health scores. Using quantile regression analysis, we found that home self-quarantine is associated with a decrease in depression and an increase in happiness, while community-level quarantine is associated with decreased happiness, especially for those in the lower happiness quantile. We also found that favorable attitudes towards COVID-19 regarding the credibility of real-time updates and confidence in the epidemic control are associated with lower levels of depression and higher levels of happiness. These effects are stronger in the upper quantile of depression and the median quantile of happiness.","Lu, Nie, Qian","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11482-020-09851-0","20200827","Attitudes; Mental health; Quantile regression; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Lockdowns: a Public Mental Health Ethics Perspective","States all over the world have reacted to COVID-19 with quarantines of entire cities, provinces, and even nations. Previous studies and preliminary evidence from current lockdowns suggest that emergency measures protecting the public's physical health by dislocating individuals, families, and social networks could well be causing a devastating public health crisis of mental ill-health in the months and years to come. This article is the first to take a public mental health ethics perspective in examining these lockdowns, the lodestar of which is the right to mental health, rooted in the concept of human dignity. Even the strictest lockdowns are not necessarily unethical but are prone to damage mental health disproportionately, with vulnerable and disadvantaged populations being at particular risk.","Cheung, Ip","https://doi.org/10.1007/s41649-020-00144-0","20200827","COVID-19; Lockdowns; Public health ethics; Public mental health; Right to mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Guidance for the Treatment and Management of COVID-19 Among People with Intellectual Disabilities","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing world crisis and people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are vulnerable due to disparity in healthcare provision and physical and mental health multimorbidity. While most people will develop mild symptoms upon contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), some will develop serious complications. The aim of this study is to present guidelines for the care and treatment of people with IDs during the COVID-19 pandemic for both community teams providing care to people with IDs and inpatient psychiatric settings. The guidelines cover specific issues associated with hospital passports, individual COVID-19 care plans, the important role of families and carers, capacity to make decisions, issues associated with social distancing, ceiling of care/treatment escalation plans, mental health and challenging behavior, and caring for someone suspected of contracting or who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 within community or inpatient psychiatric settings. We have proposed that the included conditions recommended by Public Health England to categorize someone as high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 should also include mental health and challenging behavior. There are specific issues associated with providing care to people with IDs and appropriate action must be taken by care providers to ensure that disparity of healthcare is addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that our guidance is focused upon healthcare delivery in England and invite others to augment our guidance for use in other jurisdictions.","Alexander, Ravi, Barclay, Sawhney, Chester, Malcolm, Brolly, Mukherji, Zia, Tharian, Howell, Lane, Cooper, Langdon","https://doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12352","20200827","COVIDâ€19; SARSâ€CoVâ€2; coronavirus; intellectual disabilities; learning disabilities; neurodevelopmental disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study","The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control. The results emphasize the protective effect of PMH in extraordinary situations such as the current outbreak of COVID-19. El brote COVID-19 y la falta de vacuna hicieron necesarias acciones extraordinarias como la distancia social. Algunas personas experimentan las restricciones en la vida diaria como sobrecarga emocional y otras se adaptan a la situaciÃ³n, tratando de sacar lo mejor de ella. Se investigÃ³ el alcance y predictores de sobrecarga emocional inducida por el COVID-19 en Alemania. Se evaluaron niveles de estrÃ©s y salud mental positiva en octubre de 2019 con DASS-21 y Escala-PMH, y en marzo de 2020, agregando medidas de sobrecarga emocional y percepciÃ³n de control. En una muestra de 436 participantes, el 28% permaneciÃ³ en cuarentena, 22 personas tuvieron sÃ­ntomas relevantes y una dio positivo en COVID-19. La mayorÃ­a experimentaron niveles de sobrecarga emocional medio-alto, aunque trataron de sobrellevar la situaciÃ³n lo mejor posible. Los sÃ­ntomas de estrÃ©s en octubre 2019 predijeron un nivel de sobrecarga mÃ¡s elevado en marzo 2020 y, contrariamente, los niveles de salud mental positiva en octubre 2019 predijeron un menor nivel de sobrecarga emocional en marzo 2020. Sorprendentemente, los sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n y ansiedad no predijeron la sensaciÃ³n de sobrecarga posterior. El efecto protector de la salud mental positiva y el impacto negativo de los sÃ­ntomas de estrÃ©s fueron mediados por la percepciÃ³n de control.

"Perceived stress among students in virtual classrooms during the COVID-19 outbreak in KSA","COVID-19 is a newly discovered infectious Coronavirus that became pandemic. Since disease outbreaks can have mental health consequences, this study explored the perceived stress level among students during the Coronavirus Disease Outbreak and suspension of in-person teaching in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional survey of a sample consisting of 367 students living in Saudi Arabia assessed socio-demographic characteristics, Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and their emotions and concerns during the outbreak. Most participants were female (74.7%) and secondary school (79.8%) students. More than half of the participants showed moderate levels of stress (55%), while 30.2% registered high levels. Females and university students showed a significant association with stress level (<i>p</i>-valueÂ =Â 0.003 and 0.049, respectively). There was a moderate to high level of stress among students in KSA at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study found a significant correlation between a high level of stress and female university students. The integration of online counselling and stress management programs would help mitigate the stress of students during distance learning.

"Validation and Psychometric Properties of the Japanese Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Among Adolescents","In the context of the global outbreak of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to explore the effects of this pandemic on the mental health of adolescents. The present study aims to adapt and validate a Japanese-version Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with a sample of adolescent students from Japan. To this end, the Japanese-version FCV-19S, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS) were administered to a sample of Japanese adolescents in schools. The results of statistical analyses revealed that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a bi-factor model consisting of the emotional response factor and the physiological response factor, with high reliability (emotional: <i>Î±</i>Â =â€‰.71; physiological: <i>Î±</i>Â =â€‰.82). Constructive validity was shown by the significant positive correlation between the GAD-7 and emotional (<i>r</i>Â =â€‰.11) and physiological response (<i>r</i>Â =â€‰.25), between PHQ-A and physiological response (<i>r</i>Â =â€‰.19), and between both factors and the PVDS subscale (<i>rs</i>Â &gt;â€‰.16).

"Online Gambling in the Midst of COVID-19: A Nexus of Mental Health Concerns, Substance Use and Financial Stress","This study examined the emerging impact of COVID-19 on gambling during the first 6Â weeks of emergency measures in Ontario, Canada. A cross-sectional online survey of 2005 gamblers, including a sub-sample of 1081 online gamblers (age 18Â years and older), was administered to assess risky gambling behaviours and motivations, financial impacts from COVID-19, the influence of COVID-19 on online gambling, mental health concerns and substance use. A series of odds ratio comparisons and measures of association were carried out. Results show significant likelihood of online gambling among those classified as high-risk gamblers (according to the Problem Gambling Severity Index) and those with past experience of online gambling, though migration from land-based gambling was apparent. Among high-risk online gamblers, the most predictive risk factors included moderate and severe anxiety and depression, reduced work hours, being influenced to gamble due to COVID-19, gambling under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and risky gambling motives tied to mental health concerns, including gambling because it helps with nervousness and depression, chasing gambling losses and seeking to earn income. This study has confirmed many of the risk associations presented in emerging COVID-19-related studies and past research on global economic crisis relating to gambling risk, mental health concerns and substance use. However, unlike many past studies, the present paper takes note of all of these elements holistically and provides incremental clarity on online gambling risk factors during the pandemic, specifically.","Price","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00366-1","20200827","COVID-19; Financial stress; Gambling motives; Mental health; Online gambling; Substance use","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Malay Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Validity and Reliability","The newly developed Persian Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item uni-dimensional scale that assesses the severity of fear of COVID-19. A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach Î± value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (râ€‰=â€‰0.481, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) and stress (râ€‰=â€‰0.389, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-M's properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods. It therefore is a highly crucial and timely addition to the psychological toolkit both in operational and research settings in identifying, managing and responding to the psychological distress engendered by COVID-19.","Pang, Kamu, Hambali, Mun, Kassim, Mohamed, Ayu, Rahim, Omar, Jeffree","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00355-4","20200827","COVID-19; COVID-19 fear; Coronavirus; FCV-19S Malay; Fear of COVID-19 scale; Malaysia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Adaptation of the Bangla Version of the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale","The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) is among the first few published screening tools for assessing dysfunctional anxiety induced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The CAS was translated into the Bangla language following the International Test Commission's guidelines for this adaptation study and placed in an online survey (<i>N</i>â€‰=â€‰737, with a mean age of 26.55 (<i>SD</i>â€‰=â€‰7.166Â years) to assess the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the scale. Results suggested that all items had a good item discrimination index and single-factor structure with good factor loadings. The CAS Bangla version was found to have good internal consistency reliabilities, test-retest reliability, and composite reliability (â‰¥â€‰0.7). The measurement invariance suggested invariances across age groups and gender. The CAS Bangla version showed a high correlation to the anxiety subscale of the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and a moderate correlation to the depression subscale of the DASS-21 and the COVID-19 Worry Scale. This validation of a Bangla CAS scale would be helpful for mental health practitioners to assess pandemic anxiety among the Bangladeshi people.","Ahmed, Faisal, Sharker, Lee, Jobe","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00357-2","20200827","Anxiety; Anxiety scale; Bangladesh; COVID-19 pandemic; Psychometric properties","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in a US College Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted college students' coursework, stress levels, and perceived health. Various estimates indicate that high proportions of college students have experienced increased amounts of stress (Dziech, <i>Inside Higher Education</i>, 2020; Hartocollis, <i>New York Times</i>, 2020), yet other sources indicate that many college students respond to these changes with resilience (Kelley, <i>Cornell Chronicle</i>, 2020). A method for assessing student anxiety regarding the pandemic is thus needed. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) (Ahorsu et al., <i>International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction</i>, 2020) is a seven-item scale which has been validated and shown to possess good psychometric qualities in studies of participants from multiple countries. The current study used a cross-sectional convenience sample of US college student participants (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰237) and found that the FCV-19S has high reliability and validity as demonstrated by its internal consistency and strong one-factor solution. Scores on the FCV-19S were positively correlated with anxiety for students who were married or of Asian descent. Additionally, the FCV-19S was only moderately correlated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), suggesting that the FCV-19S may bring added utility to research and clinical practice with populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perz, Lang, Harrington","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00356-3","20200827","Anxiety; COVID-19; College students; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Psychometrics; USA","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychometric Properties of a Spanish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in General Population of Lima, Peru","The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has increased the anxiety and fear experienced by many. The main objective of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Spanish-translated version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sample of population in Peru. This is a cross-sectional instrumental study. Data were collected by a convenience sampling method, resulting in a total of 832 participants, and the collection took place over 1Â week, April 17-23, 2020. The original version of the FCV-19S was translated from English into Spanish. The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factors-one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of COVID-19 (CFIâ€‰=â€‰0.988, RMSEAâ€‰=â€‰0.075). Invariance between healthcare workers and age groups was reached (Î”CFI &lt;â€‰0.01), but the invariance between men and women was not met (Î”CFIâ€‰=â€‰0.02). Convergent validity was found with depressive, anxious, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The general factor of the fear of COVID-19 and two specific factors had an optimal level of internal consistency (Ï‰â€‰&gt;â€‰0.89 and Î±â€‰&gt;â€‰0.83).

"Aging and Feeling Valued Versus Expendable During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: a Review and Commentary of Why Mattering Is Fundamental to the Health and Well-Being of Older Adults","The current commentary and review examines the potentially protective role of feelings of mattering among elderly people during typical times and the current atypical times associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Mattering is the feeling of being important to others in ways that give people the sense that they are valued and other people care about them. We contrast this feeling with messages of not mattering and being expendable and disposable due to ageism, gaps in the provision of care, and apparently economically focused positions taken during the pandemic that disrespect the value, worth, and merits of older persons. We provide a comprehensive review of past research on individual differences in mattering among older adults and illustrate the unique role of mattering in potentially protecting older adults from mental health problems. Mattering is also discussed in terms of its links with loneliness and physical health. This article concludes with a discussion of initiatives and interventions that can be modified and enhanced to instill a sense of mattering among older adults. Key directions for future research are also highlighted along with ways to expand the mattering concept to more fully understand and appreciate the relevance of mattering among older adults.","Flett, Heisel","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00339-4","20200827","Ageism; Commentary; Depression; Geropsychology; Health; Mattering; Older adults; Review; Suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"An Investigation of the Effect of COVID-19 on OCD in Youth in the Context of Emotional Reactivity, Experiential Avoidance, Depression and Anxiety","In addition to the serious physical and medical effects on individuals, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have short- and long-term psycho-social consequences, especially for young people. Nowadays, with psychological problems becoming more widely recognized in adolescents, it is possible that the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic will trigger various anxiety disorders, OCD and similar negative outcomes. Considering that psychological qualities such as emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance observed in adolescents may increase the risk of such psycho-social disorders, in this study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and OCD was investigated in a Turkish sample of 598 adolescents, and the mediating role of emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety in this relationship was examined. The data collection was performed online rather than in person because of the COVID-19 threat. A structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that the effect of COVID-19 fear on OCD is mediated by emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety.","SeÃ§er, UlaÅŸ","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00322-z","20200827","COVID-19 fear; Depression; Emotional reactivity; Experiential avoidance; OCD","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Gender and Fear of COVID-19 in a Cuban Population Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency that could potentially have a serious impact on public health. Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples <i>t</i> test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male. Our results corroborate international research that indicate a greater psychological vulnerability in women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result points to the need to design interventions that reduce the negative impact of the current outbreak on women's mental health.","Broche-PÃ©rez, FernÃ¡ndez-Fleites, JimÃ©nez-Puig, FernÃ¡ndez-Castillo, RodrÃ­guez-Martin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00343-8","20200827","Fear; Fear of COVID-19; Gender; Psychological impact","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Mental Health, and Preventive Behaviours Across Pregnant Women and Husbands: An Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling","The present cross-sectional study examined the actor-partner interdependence effect of fear of COVID-19 among Iranian pregnant women and their husbands and its association with their mental health and preventive behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A total of 290 pregnant women and their husbands (<i>N</i>â€‰=â€‰580) were randomly selected from a list of pregnant women in the Iranian Integrated Health System and were invited to respond to psychometric scales assessing fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives' actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety. Moreover, a husband actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Additionally, there were significant partner effects observed for both the pregnant wives and their husbands concerning all outcomes. The present study used a cross-sectional design and so is unable to determine the mechanism or causal ordering of the effects. Also, the data are mainly based on self-reported measures which have some limitations due to its potential for social desirability and recall biases. Based on the findings, couples may benefit from psychoeducation thatÂ focuses on the effect of mental health problems on pregnant women and the foetus.","Ahorsu, Imani, Lin, Timpka, BrostrÃ¶m, Updegraff, Ã…restedt, Griffiths, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00340-x","20200827","APIM; Anxiety; COVID-19 preventive behaviour; Depression; Dyad; Pregnancy; Suicidal intention","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Coronavirus Stress, Optimism-Pessimism, Psychological Inflexibility, and Psychological Health: Psychometric Properties of the Coronavirus Stress Measure","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a global health threat attributed to negatively affecting the mental health and well-being of people globally. The purpose of the present study is to examine the mediating role of optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility in the relationship of coronavirus stress with psychological problems among Turkish adults. The sample of the study included 451 adults (55% women). Participants mainly consisted of young adults with a mean age of 23.30Â years, ranging from 18 to 65Â years (SDâ€‰=â€‰6.97). A mediation model indicated that coronavirus stress had a significant predictive effect on optimism-pessimism, psychological inflexibility, and psychological problems. Further, optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility mediated the effect of coronavirus stress on psychological problems in adults. Lastly, optimism-pessimism predicted the psychological problems of adults through psychological inflexibility. These results elucidate our understanding of the role of mediators in coronavirus stress and psychological health problems. The findings are useful in terms of providing evidence for tailoring interventions and implementing preventative approaches to mitigate the psychopathological consequences of COVID-19. Based on the present findings, the potential utility of acceptance and commitment therapy is discussed within the context of COVID-19.","Arslan, YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m, Tanhan, BuluÅŸ, Allen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00337-6","20200827","Acceptance commitment therapy; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Optimism; Pessimism; Psychological inflexibility","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

As a result of the correlation analysis, a positive relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress, and a negative relationship was determined between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The result of the analysis for the study model indicated that there was a mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. Eliminating uncertainty from the fear of COVID-19 will contribute to reducing depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing positivity.","BakioÄŸlu, Korkmaz, Ercan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00331-y","20200827","Anxiety; Depression; Fear of COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty; Positivity; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"When Stay-at-Home Orders Leave Victims Unsafe at Home: Exploring the Risk and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel coronavirus pandemic (hereafter COVID-19) is likely to have unprecedented impacts on the incidence and impacts of crime and violence globally. This includes impacts to the risk, consequences, and decision-making of women experiencing violence by an intimate partner (hereafter IPV). Most importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the risk of IPV is likely to differentially impact vulnerable populations, including minority women and those with long histories of victimization and mental health issues. This review paper explores the potential short- and long-term implications of COVID-19 on the risk of IPV, highlighting some of the most recent preliminary data. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, record levels of male unemployment, added stressors in the home, including the care and home schooling of children, and the social distancing measures required by the epidemiological response, may serve to undermine the decades of progress made in keeping women and children safe at home. Victim police reporting, help-seeking decisions, and social service utilization during the pandemic are likely to be impacted by stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for providing safety planning and self-care for victims and their children.","Kaukinen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09533-5","20200827","COVID-19; Intimate partner violence; Mental health and PTSD; Social distancing and stay-at-home orders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This perspective is embedded in the gendered approach and feminist framework which attempts to explore and offer the embodied intersectional and divergent impact on living during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown.","Mukhtar","https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12482","20200824","COVIDâ€19 (coronavirus); awareness; counselling psychologist; feminism; gendered impact; growth; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A Feminist Perspective on COVID-19 and the Value of Care Work Globally","The shared response to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that the vast majority of society believes human well-being - not economic growth - should be at the center of policy. COVID-19 exposes the foundational role of care work, both paid and unpaid, to functioning societies and economies. Focusing on &quot;production&quot; instead of the sustainable reproduction of human life devalues care work and those who perform it. Women's physical and mental health, and the societies that rely on them, are at stake. When these policies are formulated, the field of feminist economics has valuable lessons for mitigating hardships as countries navigate the related economic fallout. A comprehensive response to the COVID-19 crisis must recognize this gendered work as an integral part of the economic system that promotes human well-being for all.","Bahn, Cohen, van der Meulen Rodgers","https://doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12459","20200824","COVIDâ€19; care; health; social reproduction; work","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A new SAIR model on complex networks for analysing the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","Nowadays, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading around the world and has attracted extremely wide public attention. From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on people's livelihood, societies and economies.","Liu, Wu, Niu, Wu, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11071-020-05704-5","20200827","COVID-19; SAIR model; latent period; social network","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health toll from the coronavirus: Social media usage reveals Wuhan residents' depression and secondary trauma in the COVID-19 outbreak","This study investigates the possible association between social media usage and the mental health toll from the coronavirus at the peak of Wuhan's COVID-19 outbreak. Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan - the first epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic - used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues. The results imply that taking a social media break may promote well-being during the pandemic, which is crucial to mitigating mental health harm inflicted by the pandemic.","Zhong, Huang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2020.106524","20200902","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Health behavior change; Mental health; Social media; Wuhan","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.","Isaacs Russell","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581","20200824","COVIDâ€19; PANDEMIC; PRESENCE; PSYCHOANALYSIS; PSYCHOTHERAPY; REMOTE THERAPY; SCREEN RELATIONS; TECHNOLOGY","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Distance education as a response to pandemics: Coronavirus and Arab culture","Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox 'distanceship'.","Al Lily, Ismail, Abunasser, Alhajhoj Alqahtani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101317","20200831","Crisis; Disaster; Distance learning; Emergency; Social distancing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Present-Day Mass Tourism: its Imaginaries and Nightmare Scenarios","Present-day mass tourism uncannily resembles an auto-immune disease. Yet, self-destructive as it may be, it is also self-regenerating, changing its appearance and purpose. They are two modes that stand in contrast to each other. We can see them as opposites that delimit a conceptual dimension ordering varieties of present-day mass tourism. The first pole calls forth tourism as a force leaving ruin and destruction in its wake or at best a sense of nostalgia for what has been lost, the other sees tourism as a force endlessly resuscitating and re-inventing itself. This paper article highlights both sides of the story. These times of the Covid-19 pandemic, with large swathes of public life emptied by social lock-down, remind us of a second, cross-cutting conceptual dimension, ranging from public space brimming with human life to its post-apocalyptic opposite eerily empty and silent.

"Managing Mass Fatalities during COVID-19: Lessons for Promoting Community Resilience During Global Pandemics","In the United States and around the world, COVID-19 represents a mass fatality incident, as there are more bodies than can be handled using existing resources. Although the management and disposition of bodies is distressing and heartrending, it is a task that local, state, and federal governments must plan for and respond to collaboratively with the private sector and faith-based community. When mass fatalities are mismanaged, there are grave emotional and mental health consequences that can delay recovery and undermine community resilience. Using insights from one of the author's mass fatality management research during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, this article explores how mass fatalities are being managed in response to COVID-19. Based on the researcher's findings a decade ago, it is apparent that many lessons have not been learnt. This article concludes by providing governments with practical lessons on how to manage mass fatalities to facilitate and promote community resilience.","Entress, Tyler, Sadiq","https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.13232","20200824",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This case study examines an education and environment program which has adapted to the social distancing measures of COVID-19, resulting in an even more community-reliant and community-driven program than the program designers initially intended. The Eco Ambassador Program uses environmental activism within a space that supports mental health during COVID-19 social isolation. While community engagement and action have been elements of the program, the program has transformed to utilize new levels of social capital in the program's network, to overcome the obstacles presented in regular programming. Many aspects of the critical pedagogy of space are utilized to conceptualize this educational program during the pandemic. The limitations of in-person interactions in defined learning spaces led to more technology-reliant programming, hence broadening the space of place-based learning, while enabling personal spaces and personal environments to become new learning spaces.","Iyengar, Shin","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09467-0","20200824","COVID-19; Case study; Community; Community-based learning; Coronavirus; Education; Environment; Place-based education","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This article focuses on such crisis-driven policy learning, examining how the experiences of China and South Korea as early responder states influenced the subsequent coronavirus crisis management in Germany. The first reaction of the German core executive was the quick concentration of decision-making power at the top of the political hierarchy. Asserting the prerogatives of the executive included the radical simplification of the relationship between politics, law and science. State actors took emergency measures by recourse to a single piece of legislation-the 'infection protection law' (<i>Infektionsschutzgesetz</i>)-overriding other elements of the legal order. They also limited the government's use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government's crisis measures. Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition-namely public willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health-that is absent in the German case.","Dostal","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-923X.12865","20200824","China; Germany; South Korea; coronavirus; policy learning; risk","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"CBT-Informed Interventions for Essential Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic face heightened levels of anxiety and depression due to increased work demands, lack of adequate personal protective equipment, fear of contracting the virus, and fear of spreading it to loved ones. This is a time of urgent need for mental health support for workers affected by the pandemic crisis. Clinicians may employ empirically supported interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and related therapies. Psychological First Aid, an evidence-based crisis intervention, may be utilized to emphasize basic needs and support, but is intended as an acute disaster intervention. Given that a pandemic is an ongoing and prolonged stressor, additional CBT-informed interventions are likely needed to fully support essential workers during these times. It is recommended that clinicians help essential worker clients meet their basic needs by modifying health and sleep habits where possibleÂ and helping them advocate for their needs using interpersonal effectiveness skills. Empathic listening, validation of the crisis at hand, and values clarification can aid the therapeutic relationship, help them feel a renewed sense of purpose and meaning in their careers and with their families,Â and facilitate behavior change consistent with chosen values. Self-monitoring through a daily diary can help clients focus their thoughts and recognize maladaptive patterns in their thoughts and behaviors. In tandem with these techniques, behavioral activation and coping strategies including relaxation, distress tolerance, and acceptance promote engaging in positive and adaptive activities. Finally, therapists can help clients reduce anxiety related to the pandemic by helping them limit information intake.","Benhamou, Piedra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10879-020-09467-3","20200827","CBT; COVID-19; Cognitive-behavioral interventions; Crisis intervention; Essential workers; Frontline professionals; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological Intervention and COVID-19: What We Know So Far and What We Can Do","The coronavirus COVID-19 and the global pandemic has already had a substantial disruptive impact on society, posing major challenges to the provision of mental health services in a time of crisis, and carrying the spectre of an increased burden to mental health, both in terms of existing psychiatric disorder, and emerging psychological distress from the pandemic. In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.","Inchausti, MacBeth, Hasson-Ohayon, Dimaggio","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10879-020-09460-w","20200827","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Digital therapy; Psychological interventions; Psychotherapy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"[PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social]","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country &quot;at war&quot; against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population.

"[General sanitary containment during the Coronavirus epidemic: Medico-psychological consequences in general population, caregivers, and subjects suffering previously from mental disorders (Retrospective on the repercussions of lethal mass risks, scientific models of collective confinement, first clinical observations, implementation of countermeasures and innovative therapeutic strategies)]","The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found, and to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialised medico-psychological monitoring. We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in war zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favourable in this, as evidenced by the &quot;debate on chloroquine&quot; widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death, which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the &quot;Western man&quot; tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalisation of e-psychotherapy asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some questioning, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behaviour, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: depending on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face consequences resulting from other crises, especially social ones.","AuxÃ©mÃ©ry, Tarquinio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001","20200827","Confinement; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Online psychotherapy; Psychopathology; Reaction to stress; Sociopathology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"[Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?]","This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Tarquinio, Tarquinio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200827","COVID-19; Containment; Health; Hope; Optimism","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic","To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of insomnia symptoms among Chinese adolescents and young adults affected by the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12-29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students' projections of trends in COVID-19. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a risk factor for insomnia symptoms; as such, the government must devote more attention to sleep disorders in this patient population while combating COVID-19.","Zhou, Wang, Yang, Yang, Zhang, Guo, Chen, Wang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001","20200903","Adolescents; COVID-19; Insomnia; Prevalence; Young adults","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Standing up for health - improving mental wellbeing during COVID-19 isolation by reducing sedentary behaviour","The global COVID-19 outbreak and its management are disrupting ways of life and increasing the risk of poor mental and physical health for many. The restrictions on movement have made some forms of physical activity harder to achieve and increased the chances of more sedentary behaviour. Independent of exercise taken, sedentary behaviour can have a negative impact upon mental health, especially by lowering mood. We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home. These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others. At a time in which our mental and physical health needs are more critical than ever, the relationship between sedentary behaviour and low mood is of particular importance. The current situation represents a good opportunity for us all to change habits to implement a less sedentary lifestyle, for now and the future. This can start with changes we can make at home during lockdown.","Diamond, Byrd","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.137","20200903","Depression; Lockdown; Low mood; Physical activity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Neurocovid-19: A clinical neuroscience-based approach to reduce SARS-CoV-2 related mental health sequelae","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a disaster due to not only its psychosocial impact but it also to its direct effects on the brain. The latest evidence suggests it has neuroinvasive mechanisms, in addition to neurological manifestations, and as seen in past pandemics, long-term sequelae are expected. Specific and well-structured interventions are necessary, and that's why it's important to ensure a continuity between primary care, emergency medicine, and psychiatry. Evidence shows that 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) survivors developed persistent psychiatric comorbidities after the infection, in addition to Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. A proper stratification of patients according not only to psychosocial factors but also an inflammatory panel and SARS-Cov-2's direct effects on the central nervous system (CNS) and the immune system, may improve outcomes. The complexity of COVID-19's pathology and the impact on the brain requires appropriate screening that has to go beyond the psychosocial impact, taking into account how stress and neuroinflammation affects the brain. This is a call for a clinical multidisciplinary approach to treat and prevent Sars-Cov-2 mental health sequelae.","Pallanti, Grassi, Makris, Gasic, Hollander","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.08.008","20200903","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Neurocovid; Psychosocial support; SARS-COV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Three months of loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown","The majority of the U.S. population has been under stay-at-home restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 since March 2020. Over the first three months of restrictions, 3,121 U.S. adults completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Despite relaxation of lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders over that time, loneliness scores increased significantly, particularly from April to May 2020, and appear to have plateaued by June. Loneliness was correlated with depression and suicidal ideation at all time points and was most prevalent among individuals who reported that they were still under community restrictions to socially isolate due to the novel coronavirus. Loneliness remains elevated despite the reopening of many communities.","Killgore, Cloonan, Taylor, Miller, Dailey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113392","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

To determine the effect of these restrictions on suicidal ideation, a total of 3,120 individuals completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at one of three time points from April through June 2020. The percentage of respondents endorsing suicidal ideation was greater with each passing month for those under lockdown or shelter-in-place restrictions due to the novel coronavirus, but remained relatively stable and unchanged for those who reported no such restrictions.

"The burden of alcohol on health care during COVID-19","Alcohol's impact on global health is substantial and of a similar order of magnitude to that from COVID-19. Alcohol now also poses specific concerns, such as increased risk of severe lung infections, domestic violence, child abuse, depression and suicide. Its use is unlikely to aid physical distancing or other preventative behavioural measures. Globally, alcohol contributes to 20% of injury and 11.5% of non-injury emergency room presentations. We provide some broad comparisons between alcohol-attributable and COVID-19-related hospitalisations and deaths in North America using most recent data. For example, for Canada in 2017 it was recently estimated there were 105â€‰065 alcohol-attributable hospitalisations which represent a substantially higher rate over time than the 10â€‰521 COVID-19 hospitalisations reported during the first 5â€‰months of the pandemic. Despite the current importance of protecting health-care services, most governments have deemed alcohol sales to be as essential as food, fuel and pharmaceuticals. In many countries, alcohol is now more readily available and affordable than ever before, a situation global alcohol producers benefit from and have helped engineer. We argue that to protect frontline health-care services and public health more generally, it is essential that modest, evidence-based restrictions on alcohol prices, availability and marketing are introduced. In particular, we recommend increases in excise taxation coupled with minimum unit pricing to both reduce impacts on health-care services and provide much-needed revenues for governments at this critical time.","Stockwell, Andreasson, Cherpitel, Chikritzhs, Dangardt, Holder, Naimi, Sherk","https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13143","20200903","COVID-19; alcohol; healthcare; mortality; policy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The quality of research on mental health related to the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review","SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This study aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open scientific research practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Twenty-eight studies were identified through a systematic search. Most of them met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, the widespread use of convenience samples and the lack of a priori power analysis, coupled with low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies and availability of databases, raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good scientific practice.","Nieto, Navas, VÃ¡zquez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100123","20200824","COVID-19; Mental health; Research quality; Systematic review","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Antipsychotic-induced immune dysfunction: A consideration for COVID-19 risk","Patients with severe mental illness are more susceptible to infections for a variety of reasons, some associated with the underlying disease and some due to environmental factors including housing insecurity, smoking, poor access to healthcare, and medications used to treat these disorders. This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23Â®. These data indicate that short-to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.","May, Slitzky, Rostama, Barlow, Houseknecht","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100097","20200824","Adaptive immunity; Antipsychotic; Cytokine; Infection; Inflammation; Pneumonia; Risperidone","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19: Psychological flexibility, coping, mental health, and wellbeing in the UK during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of many people across the globe, both through the direct interpersonal cost of the disease, and the governmental restrictions imposed to mitigate its spread and impact. The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of 'lockdown' (15th-21st May 2020) and the specific role of <i>Psychological Flexibility</i> as a potential mitigating process. We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (NÂ =Â 555). However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress. Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest. No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found. In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses). Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping. We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic.","Dawson, Golijani-Moghaddam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010","20200824","COVID-19; Coping; Coronavirus; Mental health; Psychological flexibility; Wellbeing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The moderating roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Italy","The Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility on the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in Italy. Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (<i>M</i>Â =Â 39.29 days, <i>SD</i>Â =Â 11.26), 1035 adults (79% female, <i>M</i>Â =Â 37.5 years, <i>SD</i>Â =Â 12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pakenham, Landi, Boccolini, Furlani, Grandi, Tossani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003","20200827","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Lockdown; Peritraumatic distress; Psychological flexibility; Psychological inflexibility","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A contextual behavioral approach for responding to moral dilemmas in the age of COVID-19","Prior pandemics and current news stories suggest that a &quot;second pandemic&quot; of potentially devastating mental health consequences will follow the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the changing contextual demands associated with the pandemic for many people, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 are likely to include exposure to a range of moral dilemmas. Such dilemmas may set the stage for the development of moral distress and moral injury in a broad range of contexts from the ER to the grocery store. In the current paper we offer an approach to responding to moral dilemmas presented by COVID-19. We propose a contextual behavioral model of moral injury that is relevant to those experiencing moral pain associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this model, we offer two different approaches to intervening on COVID-19-related moral dilemmas. First, we propose the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Moral Injury (ACT-MI) among individuals suffering from moral injury. Second, to intervene on moral dilemmas at the level of the group, we propose the use of the Prosocial intervention. We offer case examples describing ACT-MI and Prosocial to highlight how these interventions might be applied to moral-dilemma-related concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss implications for future research.","Borges, Barnes, Farnsworth, Drescher, Walser","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.06.006","20200824",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Levels of physical activity during COVID-I9 social distancing were self-reported. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale.

Sleep disorders, in particular insomnia, have been commonly reported in frontline medical workers, in hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic and are often accompanied by depressive and anxiety symptoms. Sleep quality, however, has been mainly assessed by the use of self-reported measures, thus limiting clinical usefulness. Poor sleep quality among the medical staff is prevalent, and our experience supports that this has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The higher percentage of mental health disturbances of children with the higher education level of parents, relative infected by COVID-19 (yes), parents still need to go the workplace (yes), and parent's abnormal behavior but lower to their counterparts. This paper demonstrates large proportions of children are suffering from mental health disturbances in Bangladesh during the period of lockdown. Implementation of psychological intervention strategies and improvement in house-hold financial conditions, literacy of parents, taking care of children, and job security may help in improving the psychological/mental status of children and the authors believe that the findings will be beneficial to accelerate the rate of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) linked to health status in Bangladesh.","Yeasmin, Banik, Hossain, Hossain, Mahumud, Salma, Hossain","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105277","20200824","Bangladesh; COVID-19; Children; Lockdown; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Latent profiles of the comorbidity of the symptoms for posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder among children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19","The present study aims to examine the comorbidity patterns of the symptoms (intrusion and avoidance) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and the role of perceived threat and courtesy stigma in distinguishing specific patterns of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD among children and adolescents who are susceptible to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei, China. A total of 1172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8-18Â years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Duan, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105235","20200824","COVID-19; GAD; Latent profile; PTSD; Perceived threat; Stigma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of lockdown on learning status of undergraduate and postgraduate students during COVID-19 pandemic in West Bengal, India","To assess the impact of lockdown amidst COVID-19 on undergraduate and postgraduate learners of various colleges and universities of West Bengal. An online survey was conducted from 1 May to 8 May 2020 to collect the information. A structural questionnaire link using 'Google form' was sent to students' through WhatsApp and E-mail. A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic. This study suggests targeted interventions to create a positive space for study among students from the vulnerable section of society.

"COVID-19, Deferred Care and Telemedicine: A Problem, A Solution and a Potential Opportunity","The COVID-19 pandemic forced many health systems to proactively reduce care delivery to prepare for an expected surge of hospitalizations. There have been concerns that care deferral may have negative health effects and hopes telemedicine could provide a viable alternative. To measure the extent and reason for care deferral during a health system shutdown, to understand whether telemedicine was acceptable as a care delivery alternative and to estimate whether acceptance of telemedicine had changed during the shutdown. Cross-sectional analysis of survey responses from 1,694 primary care patients in a mid-sized northeastern city. The survey was conducted during the &quot;lock down&quot; and while the healthcare system was shut down except for care that could not be delayed. Our mains outcome was respondent report of telemedicine use and care deferral during the shutdown. : Deferred care is widespread - nearly half of respondents deferred care - but it was largely for preventive services, particularly dental and primary care, and did not cause concern about negative health effects. A quarter of those who delayed care were concerned about the health effects, with needs centered around orthopedics and surgery. Telemedicine was viewed more positively than prior to the pandemic and was overwhelmingly viewed as a viable option to deliver deferred care, particularly by those over age 65, female and college educated. Mental health services stood out for high levels of deferred care. Temporary health system shutdowns will necessarily lead to deferred care. However, much of the deferral will be for preventive services. The health effect can be moderated by prioritizing surgical and orthopedic services and moving other service lines to telemedicine. The need for telemedicine options is particularly acute for mental health services.","Atherly, Van Den Broek-Altenburg, Hart, Gleason, Carney","https://doi.org/10.2196/21607","20200824",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

In this case report, we aimed to present a young patient whose QT interval was prolonged due to hydroxychloroquine overdose which was given for COVID-19 treatment. This is the first reported case of QT interval prolongation at a low dose of 1.600 mg in the literature. A 28-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with the complaints of nausea, diarrhea, and weakness. The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 a day prior and home isolation was recommended with hydroxychloroquine and oseltamivir P. O. treatment. His complaints started 6 h after accidentally taking 1.600 mg of hydroxychloroquine P. O. at the same time. On physical examination, the Glasgow Coma Scale was 15, and neurological, respiratory, and abdominal examinations were normal. His pulse was 54 beats/min, oxygen saturation was 99%, arterial blood pressure was 122/82 mmHg, and fever was 36.5Â°C. Electrocardiography (ECG) showed sinus bradycardia and corrected QT interval was calculated as 510 ms. The QT interval prolongation and bradycardia persisted, and the patient was hospitalized for follow-up and treatment. He was discharged on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day of his hospitalization after the corrected QT interval was detected to be 420 ms and his bradycardia improved. Due to the potential cardiac side effects, patients who are sent to home isolation with treatment should be educated about the use, dosage, and possible side effects of this medicine, and serial ECG monitoring should be provided to patients who are hospitalized.","Aksel, Islam, Aslan, Eroglu","https://doi.org/10.4103/2452-2473.290063","20200825","2019 novel coronavirus infection; COVID-19; COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 virus disease; COVID-19 virus infection; SARS-CoV-2 infection; coronaviruses","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Symptoms of anxiety, depression and self-care behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population","The COVID-19 pandemic can have important psychosocial consequences in the population. To determine the levels of anxiety, depression and self-care symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population. Online survey distributed over three weeks using a non-probability sampling. The PHQ-9 Patient Health Questionnaire, the GAD-7 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and Visual analog scale for self-care behaviors were used. Between-group (anxiety and depression) descriptive and comparison analyses were carried out. Out of 1508 included participants, 20.8% had symptoms of severe anxiety, while 27.5% showed symptoms of severe depression. Being a woman, being single, having no children, having medical comorbidities and a history of mental health care were risk factors for developing symptoms of anxiety and depression; 66 to 80 % of the population complied with self-care recommendations. A need for receiving mental health care was identified in our study population. A larger number of individuals with moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms were observed than in other pandemics. COVID-19 pandemic psychological effects are considered an emerging public health problem, and implementation of programs for their care is therefore recommended.

"Factors associated with resilience among non-local medical workers sent to Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak","To investigate the resilience of non-local medical workers sent to support local medical workers in treating the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In February 2020, non-local medical workers who had been sent to Wuhan as support staff to respond to the COVID-19 outbreak were asked to complete an online survey composed of the Connor Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Survey responses from 114 non-local medical workers were analyzed. CD-RISC scores were high (67.03â€‰Â±â€‰13.22). The resilience level was highest for physicians (73.48â€‰Â±â€‰11.49), followed by support staff, including health care assistants, technicians (67.78â€‰Â±â€‰12.43) and nurses (64.86â€‰Â±â€‰13.46). Respondents differed significantly in the levels of education, training/support provided by the respondent's permanent hospital (where he or she normally works), and in their feelings of being adequately prepared and confident to complete tasks (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). Resilience correlated negatively with anxiety (râ€‰=â€‰-.498, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) and depression (râ€‰=â€‰-.471, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01) but positively with active coping styles (râ€‰=â€‰.733, Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.01).

"Mobilizing a Community-Academic Partnership to Provide DIY Handwashing Stations to Skid Row Residents During COVID-19","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is having a devastating impact on global health. In the United States and abroad, there is concern for how the novel coronavirus will affect vulnerable populations, including people experiencing homelessness. Individuals who lack stable housing are more likely to have preexisting health conditions and limited access to basic preventative hygiene practices such as handwashing and sanitizing. The situation has become critical in Los Angeles' Skid Row neighborhood, where nearly 5,000 unhoused residents (13% of the city's homeless population) reside on any given night. Community members' concerns have mounted as social and health services in the area have decreased, and early efforts to prevent the transmission of coronavirus did not adequately address the lack of access to handwashing stations and hand sanitizing products. This Practice Note details an academic-community partnership that uses grassroots organizing to provide &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; handwashing stations to the Skid Row neighborhood.

The outbreak has been continuing to heavily impact the mental health of people. Developing key strategies to prevent mental illnesses is extremely important for the well-being of people. A survey conducted during the last week of March 2020 showed that 72% of Americans felt that their lives were impacted by the outbreak, which was a 32% increase from the survey conducted only 2Â weeks earlier. The results show a positive correlation between COVID-19 infections/casualties and growing public concern. These observations suggest possible increase in mental health illnesses in United States as a consequence of the pandemic. The authors review a recently published model on COVID-19 related fear among the people. The fear of being infected or dying from the disease is one of the most significant causes of mental health disorders. Loss of employment or the fear of losing employment is another major concern leading to mental illnesses. Several unique strategies to prevent or mitigate mental illnesses are discussed.","Bhattacharjee, Acharya","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09836-0","20200827","Anxiety disorder; COVID-19; Mental health; Pandemic; Prevention strategies","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Viral, host and environmental factors that favor anthropozoonotic spillover of coronaviruses: An opinionated review, focusing on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","Environmental factors play a key role in the zoonotic transmission of emerging pathogenic viruses as mankind is constantly disturbing wildlife's ecosystems usually by cutting down forests to build human settlements or by catching wild animals for food, which deprives the viruses of their natural hosts and gives them opportunity to infect humans. In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002-2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.","da Silva, Mesquita, de SÃ£o JosÃ© Nascimento, Ferreira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483","20200903","COVID-19; MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2; Spillover; Zoonotic transmission","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors.

"Psychological factors associated with substance use initiation during the COVID-19 pandemic","The 2019 outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a devastating impact. Given the on-going nature of the outbreak, the deleterious toll on mental health, including substance use, is unknown. Negative reinforcement models of substance use posit that elevations in stress from the COVID-19 pandemic will elicit a corresponding motivation to downregulate COVID-19-related stress reactivity via substance use for a subset of the population. The current study sought to evaluate: (1) if COVID-19-related worry and fear were associated with substance use coping motives; and (2) how levels of COVID-19-related worry and fear differ between pre-COVID-19 substance users, COVID-19 substance initiators, and abstainers. Participants were 160 adults recruited nationally between April-May 2020 for an online study. Results indicated that COVID-19-related worry was associated with substance use coping motives. Additionally, compared to abstainers, pre-COVID-19 substance users and COVID-19 substance initiators demonstrated the highest levels of worry and fear. Examination of differences suggested that the COVID-19 substance initiators had the highest COVID-19-related worry and fear for all substances except for opioids, with effect size estimates ranging from small to medium. The results of this study suggest that COVID-19-specific psychological factors appear to be involved in substance use behavior.","Rogers, Shepherd, Garey, Zvolensky","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113407","20200903","COVID-19; Coping motives; Mental health; Substance use","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Using an online platform, a national sample (n = 10, 368) of U.S. adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020. The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U.S. population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography. Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country; rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found. Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities. Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts. Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology; prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States. This preliminary work provides practitioners with a glimpse of what lies ahead, which individuals and communities may be the most vulnerable, and what types of strategic interventions might help to address a wide range of mental health consequences for Americans in the months and years ahead.","Fitzpatrick, Drawve, Harris","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102291","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Fear","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The aim of this study was to assess the psychological status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, which has compounded Libya's existing civil war-related problems. A multi-center cross-sectional survey on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse was conducted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers. The data of 745 eligible healthcare workers from 15 hospitals were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared to the basic characteristics of the participants to determine the association. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants had depressive symptoms, while 348 (46.7%) had anxiety symptoms. Age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being of people living with HIV: A cross-sectional survey","Empirical data on the consequences of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on HIV care is lacking. We surveyed persons living with HIV (PLWH) in different countries to investigate whether their medical follow-up and psychosocial well-being had been compromised due to COVID-19 and associated restrictions. In April 2020, a cross-sectional survey among PLWH was conducted using a web-based multilingual questionnaire. The research tool assessed HIV follow-up, psychosocial well-being, COVID-19 (flu-like) symptoms and prevention measures. Consenting respondents provided answers anonymously. 317 PLWH were included (mean age 43.4Â±11.7; 71.6% male); 60.3% of participants resided in Belgium and Brazil. 140 (44.2%) reported experiencing a cold with at least one flu-like symptom since January 2020. Of the 18 who reported COVID-19 test results, 4 (22.2%) were positive. Seventy-four (23.3%) respondents screened positive for major depressive disorders, while 72 (22.7%) had generalized anxiety disorders. Fifty-six (17.7%) respondents reported difficulties in obtaining antiretroviral medications because of COVID-19-related measures. Adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 outbreak included greater quantities of antiretroviral refill in 67 (21.1%), phone consultations in 25 (7.9%), and new refill sites in 12 (3.9%). Factors associated with reduced risk of experiencing flu-like symptoms included flu vaccination during the last 12 months (p=0.005) and adaptations of HIV care during the COVID-19 pandemic (p=0.010). COVID-19 and associated restrictive measures seem detrimental to the well-being and follow-up of PLWH. We recommend that health systems devise innovative approaches for antiretroviral provision and psychosocial support to PLWH during such outbreaks.","Siewe Fodjo, Faria de Moura Villela, Van Hees, TibÃ©rio Dos Santos, Vanholder, Vanholder, Reyntiens, Van den Bergh, Colebunders","https://doi.org/10.1097/QAI.0000000000002468","20200822",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19: a probable role of the anticoagulant Protein S in managing COVID-19-associated coagulopathy","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused monumental mortality, and there are still no adequate therapies. Most severely ill COVID-19 patients manifest a hyperactivated immune response, instigated by interleukin 6 (IL6) that triggers a so called &quot;cytokine storm&quot; and coagulopathy. Hypoxia is also associated with COVID-19. So far overlooked is the fact that both IL6 and hypoxia depress the abundance of a key anticoagulant, Protein S. We speculate that the IL6-driven cytokine explosion plus hypoxemia causes a severe drop in Protein S level that exacerbates the thrombotic risk in COVID-19 patients. Here we highlight a mechanism by which the IL6-hypoxia curse causes a deadly hypercoagulable state in COVID-19 patients, and we suggest a path to therapy.","Chatterjee, Sengupta, Majumder, Majumder","https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103869","20200822","ACE2; IL6; Protein S; coagulopathy; cytokine storm; hypoxia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Quality improvement report: setting up a staff well-being hub through continuous engagement","The coronavirus pandemic has presented a new set of challenges for the frontline National Health Service staff. It is not only the long working hours but also the uncertainty and increase in patient mortality that has affected mental health and staff well-being. Hospitals all around the country have rightly responded with various well-being initiatives to help their staff such as wobble rooms and developing online resources. Our vision was to set up a safe space for staff away from clinical noise to enable and encourage mindfulness and psychological resilience through a calm and serene environment. We used the continuous quality improvement methodology and administered an initial needs assessment survey to see if our trust staff will be interested in having such a space. Within our team, we managed to secure a place, and used donations to hospital charity and set up a space within a week. Since opening the hub, we have had excellent feedback from various staff groups. Immediate feedback was obtained using emoji stickers asking for feelings before and after visit. A mood board was put up allowing anonymous expression of feelings. Delayed feedback was requested using a repeat survey. We believe that while there is a lot of talk about well-being and an increasing number of resources being offered electronically, the need for a neat and quiet space cannot be overlooked. We collect feedback on a weekly basis and adapt the space to meet the needs of staff. Long-term impact of such spaces will be reassessed at a later stage.","Saqib, Rampal","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjoq-2020-001008","20200902","burnout; compassion fatigue; mental health; organisational culture; professional; self care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Penetrating trauma during a global pandemic: Changing patterns in interpersonal violence, self-harm and domestic violence in the Covid-19 outbreak","The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the 'lockdown' period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.","Olding, Zisman, Olding, Fan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004","20200824","Covid-19; Pandemic; Penetrating; Self-harm; Trauma; Violence","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 Lockdown: Housing Built Environment's Effects on Mental Health","Since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on 11 March, severe lockdown measures have been adopted by the Italian Government. For over two months of stay-at-home orders, houses became the only place where people slept, ate, worked, practiced sports, and socialized. As consolidated evidence exists on housing as a determinant of health, it is of great interest to explore the impact that COVID-19 response-related lockdown measures have had on mental health and well-being. We conducted a large web-based survey on 8177 students from a university institute in Milan, Northern Italy, one of the regions most heavily hit by the pandemic in Europe. As emerged from our analysis, poor housing is associated with increased risk of depressive symptoms during lockdown. In particular, living in apartments &lt;60 m<sup>2</sup> with poor views and scarce indoor quality is associated with, respectively, 1.31 (95% CI: 1046-1637), 1.368 (95% CI: 1166-1605), and 2.253 (95% CI: 1918-2647) times the risk of moderate-severe and severe depressive symptoms. Subjects reporting worsened working performance from home were over four times more likely to also report depression (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 3713-4924). Housing design strategies should focus on larger and more livable living spaces facing green areas. We argue that a strengthened multi-interdisciplinary approach, involving urban planning, public mental health, environmental health, epidemiology, and sociology, is needed to investigate the effects of the built environment on mental health, so as to inform welfare and housing policies centered on population well-being.","Amerio, Brambilla, Morganti, Aguglia, Bianchi, Santi, Costantini, Odone, Costanza, Signorelli, Serafini, Amore, Capolongo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165973","20200901","COVID-19; evidence-based design; housing built environment; lockdown; mental health; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Housing; Humans; Italy; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Tendency to Worry and Fear of Mental Health during Italy's COVID-19 Lockdown","We tested whether the tendency to worry could affect psychological responses to quarantine by capitalizing on the opportunity of having collected data before the COVID-19 outbreak on measures of worry, anxiety, and trait mindfulness in a group of university students. Twenty-five participants completed self-report measures assessing worry (Penn State Worry Questionnaire, PSWQ), anxiety (Anxiety Sensitivity Index, ASI-3), and trait mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS) at T0 (pre-lockdown, 4 November 2019-17 February 2020) and T1 (at the end of lockdown, 26 April-30 April 2020). We compared assessments at the two time points in the whole sample and in high and low worriers (defined at T0 by scores on PSWQ respectively above and below 1.5 SD from mean of the Italian normative sample). High worriers showed at T1 a significant increase of anxiety sensitivity and fear of mental health in comparison to low worriers. Moreover, in the whole sample, at T1 trait mindfulness was inversely related to worry and fear of mental health. A valuable approach to support individuals experiencing anxiety related to the COVID-19 outbreak could be represented by mindfulness-based interventions improving the ability to focus attention and awareness on the present moment.","Baiano, Zappullo, The LabNPEE Group, Conson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165928","20200901","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; mindfulness; threat; worry; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Fear; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Health; Mindfulness; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychometrics; Quarantine; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Contagion of Sentiments during the COVID-19 Pandemic Crisis: The Case of Isolation in Spain","This study examines how confinement measures established during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis affected the emotions of the population. For this purpose, public sentiment on social media and digital ecosystems in Spain is analyzed. We identified affective tones towards media and citizens published on social media focusing on six basic emotions: anger, fear, joy, sadness, disgust and uncertainty. The main contribution of this work is the evidence of contagious sentiments and, consequently, the possibility of using this new dimension of social media as a form of a &quot;collective therapy&quot;. This paper contributes to understanding the impact of confinement measures in a pandemic from the point of view of emotional health. This analysis provides a set of practical implications that can guide conceptual and empirical work in health crisis management with an alternative approach, especially useful for decision-making processes facing emergency responses and health crises, even in an unprecedented global health crisis such as the traumatic events caused by the COVID-19 disease.","Iglesias-SÃ¡nchez, Vaccaro Witt, Cabrera, Jambrino-Maldonado","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17165918","20200901","COVID-19; confinement; contagion of emotions; emergency response; health crisis; isolation; sentiment analysis; Anger; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Global Health; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Spain","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Interrelation of Neurological and Psychological Symptoms of COVID-19: Risks and Remedies","COVID-19 has catastrophically affected the world's panoramic view of human well-being in terms of healthcare and management. With the increase in the number of cases worldwide, neurological symptoms and psychological illnesses from COVID-19 have increasingly upsurged. Mental health illness and affective disorders, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, phobia, and panic disorders, are highly impacted due to social distress. The COVID-19 pandemic not only affected people with pre-existing mental and affective illnesses, but also healthy individuals with anxiety, worrying, and panic symptoms, and fear conditioning. In addditon, the novel coronavirus is known to impact the central nervous system in the brain, resulting in severe and certain long-lasting neurological issues. Owing to the significance of neurological and psychological events, the present perspective has been an attempt to disseminate the impact of COVID-19 on neural injury through inflammation, and its interrelation with psychological symptoms. In this current review, we synthesize the literature to highlight the critical associations between SARS-CoV-2 infection and the nervous system, and mental health illness, and discuss potential mechanisms of neural injury through psycho-neuroimmunity.","Nami, Gadad, Chong, Ghumman, Misra, Gadad, Kumar, Perry, Abraham, Rao","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9082624","20200824","COVID-19; inflammation; mental health; neurological; psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. Descriptive, observational, retrospective study in three primary healthcare centres with an assigned population of 100,000. Examination of the medical records of patients with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic multivariate regression models adjusted for age and sex were constructed to analyse independent predictive factors associated with death, ICU admission and hospitalization. We included 322 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 50% female, 115 (35.7%) aged â‰¥ 65 years): 123 (38.2) were health workers (doctors, nurses, auxiliaries). Predictors of ICU admission or death were greater age (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.03 to 1.07), male sex (OR = 2.94; 95%CI = 1.55 to 5.82), autoimmune disease (OR = 2.82; 95%CI = 1.00 to 7.84), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (OR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.41 to 6.13), elevated lactate-dehydrogenase (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.28 to 6.90), elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.22 to 6.98) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 2.38; 95%CI = 1.22 to 4.68).

"Addressing Postpandemic Clinician Mental Health : A Narrative Review and Conceptual Framework","Previous pandemics have seen high psychiatric morbidity among health care workers. Protecting clinician mental health in the aftermath of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires an evidence-based approach to developing and deploying comprehensive clinician mental health support. In a narrative review of 96 articles addressing clinician mental health in COVID-19 and prior pandemics, 7 themes emerged: 1) the need for resilience and stress reduction training; 2) providing for clinicians' basic needs (food, drink, adequate rest, quarantine-appropriate housing, transportation, child care, personal protective equipment); 3) the importance of specialized training for pandemic-induced changes in job roles; 4) recognition and clear communication from leadership; 5) acknowledgment of and strategies for addressing moral injury; 6) the need for peer and social support interventions; and 7) normalization and provision of mental health support programs. In addition to the literature review, in collaboration with the Collaborative for Healing and Renewal in Medicine (CHARM) network, the authors gathered practice guidelines and resources from health care organizations and professional societies worldwide to synthesize a list of resources deemed high-yield by well-being leaders. Studies of previous pandemics demonstrate heightened distress in health care workers years after the event. The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges that surpass those of previous pandemics, suggesting a significant mental health toll on clinicians.

"Mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya: a review","The COVID-19 pandemic has exerted considerable impact on public mental health globally. With the pandemic rapidly rising in sub-Saharan Africa including Kenya, there is need to provide evidence to guide the mental health response in the region. The objective of this review is (1) to describe the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya, guided by the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework (2) to offer context specific recommendations for improvement of the mental health response in Kenya. Such information could be useful in decision-making in Kenya as well as in the greater sub-Saharan Africa region. This narrative review is based on information obtained from official government documents released from 13th March 2020, the beginning of the pandemic in Kenya, up to 31st July 2020. The COVID-19 response in Kenya has no formal mental health response plan. There is an unmet need for psychological first aid in the community. While guidelines for the management of mental health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic have been prepared, implementation remains a major challenge due to a poorly resourced mental health system. There is no mental health surveillance system in place limiting ability to design evidence-based interventions. We propose four key strategies for strengthening the mental health response in order to mitigate the harmful impact of COVID-19 on public mental health in Kenya: (1) preparation of a formal mental health response plan specific to the COVID-19 pandemic with allocation of funding for the response (2) training of community health workers and community health volunteers on psychological first aid to enable access to support for those in need during the pandemic (3) scaling up of mobile health to increase access to care (4) conducting systematic and continuous text message surveys on the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in order to inform decision-making.","Jaguga, Kwobah","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00400-8","20200824","COVID-19; Kenya; Mental health; Response; Sub-saharan africa","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Anxiety (GAD7) and depression (PHQ2) were measured. Totally, 3042 participants (nâ€‰=â€‰1964 females, age range 18-79, mean ageâ€‰=â€‰39) completed the resilience and COVID-19-related stress survey and 1350 of them (mean ageâ€‰=â€‰41, SDâ€‰=â€‰13; nâ€‰=â€‰997 females) completed GAD7 and PHQ2. Participants significantly endorsed more distress about family contracting COVID-19 (48.5%) and unknowingly infecting others (36%), than getting COVID-19 themselves (19.9%), pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0005 covarying for demographics and proxy COVID-19 exposures like getting tested and knowing infected individuals. Patterns of COVID-19 related worries, rates of anxiety (GAD7â€‰&gt;â€‰10, 22.2%) and depression (PHQ2â€‰&gt;â€‰2, 16.1%) did not differ between healthcare providers and non-healthcare providers. Higher resilience scores were associated with lower COVID-19 related worries (main effect F<sub>1,3054</sub>â€‰=â€‰134.9; pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.00001, covarying for confounders). Increase in 1â€‰SD on resilience score was associated with reduced rate of anxiety (65%) and depression (69%), across healthcare and non-healthcare professionals. Findings provide empirical evidence on mental health associated with COVID-19 outbreak in a large convenience sample, setting a stage for longitudinal studies evaluating mental health trajectories following COVID-19 pandemic.","Barzilay, Moore, Greenberg, DiDomenico, Brown, White, Gur, Gur","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00982-4","20200826",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Demographic perspectives on the mortality of COVID-19 and other epidemics","To put estimates of COVID-19 mortality into perspective, we estimate age-specific mortality for an epidemic claiming for illustrative purposes 1 million US lives, with results approximately scalable over a broad range of deaths. We calculate the impact on period life expectancy (down 2.94 y) and remaining life years (11.7 y per death). Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 trillion person years of life lost would be valued at $10.2 to $17.5 trillion. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality in other countries are quite similar and increase at rates close to each country's rate for all-cause mortality. The scenario of 1 million COVID-19 deaths is similar in scale to that of the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than that of the Spanish flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in a period of months rather than spread out over decades.","Goldstein, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006392117","20200821","COVID-19; demography; epidemic; life expectancy; mortality","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Compulsory medical intervention versus external constraint in pandemic control","Would compulsory treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 be justified? In England, there would be significant legal barriers to it. However, we offer a conditional ethical argument in favour of allowing compulsory treatment and vaccination, drawing on an ethical comparison with external constraints-such as quarantine, isolation and 'lockdown'-that have already been authorised to control the pandemic in this jurisdiction. We argue that, <i>if</i> the permissive English approach to external constraints for COVID-19 has been justified, then there is a case for a similarly permissive approach to compulsory medical interventions.","Douglas, Forsberg, Pugh","https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106435","20200821","compulsion; ethics; isolation; law; mental health law; public health ethics; public health law; quarantine; vaccination","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the societal response to COVID-19 on access to healthcare for non-COVID-19 health issues in slum communities of Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan: results of pre-COVID and COVID-19 lockdown stakeholder engagements","With COVID-19, there is urgency for policymakers to understand and respond to the health needs of slum communities. Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","Ahmed, Ajisola, Azeem, Bakibinga, Chen, Choudhury, Fayehun, Griffiths, Harris, Kibe, Lilford, Omigbodun, Rizvi, Sartori, Smith, Watson, Wilson, Yeboah, Aujla, Azam, Diggle, Gill, Iqbal, Kabaria, Kisia, Kyobutungi, Madan, Mberu, Mohamed, Nazish, Odubanjo, Osuh, Owoaje, Oyebode, Porto de Albuquerque, Rahman, Tabani, Taiwo, Tregonning, Uthman, Yusuf","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003042","20200903","disease; disorder; health policy; health systems; or injury; other infection; public health; qualitative study; Africa South of the Sahara; Asia, Western; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Poverty Areas; Public Health; Stakeholder Participation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Unspoken inequality: how COVID-19 has exacerbated existing vulnerabilities of asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in South Africa","An estimated 2 million foreign-born migrants of working age (15-64) were living in South Africa (SA) in 2017. Structural and practical xenophobia has driven asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in SA to abject poverty and misery. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) containment measures adopted by the SA government through the lockdown of the nation have tremendously deepened the unequal treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees in SA. This can be seen through the South African government's lack of consideration of this marginalized population in economic, poverty, and hunger alleviation schemes. Leaving this category of our society out of the national response safety nets may lead to negative coping strategies causing mental health issues and secondary health concerns. An effective response to the socioeconomic challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the economic and health impact of the pandemic on asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants.","Mukumbang, Ambe, Adebiyi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01259-4","20200825","Asylum-seekers; COVID-19; Mental health; Refugees; South Africa; Undocumented migrants; Adolescent; Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Government; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Refugees; Socioeconomic Factors; South Africa; Undocumented Immigrants; Vulnerable Populations; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological distress related to COVID-19 - The contribution of continuous traumatic stress","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. This study relied on convenience sampling. Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.","Lahav","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141","20200903","COVID-19; Continuous traumatic stress; Posttraumatic stress symptoms; Psychological distress; Trauma exposure","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health &amp; wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study","COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (BÂ =Â 3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (BÂ =Â 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (BÂ =Â 3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (BÂ =Â 7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms. This COVID-19 outbreak imposes psychological consequences on people to a great extent which requires attention from the concerned authorities to cope with this situation mentally. The perception about the outbreak can also play a big role in psychological impact.","Khan, Sultana, Hossain, Hasan, Ahmed, Sikder","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.135","20200903","Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Depression; Home-quarantine; Mental health &amp; wellbeing; Stress; Students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Post-discharge health status and symptoms in patients with severe COVID-19","Little is known about long-term recovery from severe COVID-19 disease. Here, we characterize overall health, physical health and mental health of patients one month after discharge for severe COVID-19. This was a prospective single health system observational cohort study of patients â‰¥18 years hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 disease who required at least 6 liters of oxygen during admission, had intact baseline cognitive and functional status and were discharged alive. Participants were enrolled between 30 and 40 days after discharge. Outcomes were elicited through validated survey instruments: the PROMIS Dyspnea Characteristics and PROMIS Global Health-10. A total of 161 patients (40.6% of eligible) were enrolled; 152 (38.3%) completed the survey. Median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR], 50-67); 57 (37%) were female. Overall, 113/152 (74%) participants reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 3 out of 10 [IQR 0-5]), vs. 47/152 (31%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1), p&lt;0.001.

"Public Behavior Change, Perceptions, Depression, and Anxiety in Relation to the COVID-19 Outbreak","COVID-19 has spread rapidly and internationally, which has elicited public panic and psychological problems. Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. A total of 6261 people were included in the analysis, with 3613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1743 in Wuhan). The majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who were infected or whose family members were infected had a much higher prevalence of depression and anxiety. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak can be controlled by protective behaviors were associated with lower prevalence of depression and anxiety. Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further research may focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify methods of delivery of better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Liu, Teng, Chen, Zhao, Wang, Wu, Xiao, Wang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273","20200901","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; perceptions; public behavior change","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Health Inequalities in the Use of Telehealth in the United States in the Lens of COVID-19","The use of remote health care services, or telehealth, is a promising solution for providing health care to those unable to access care in person easily and thus helping to reduce health inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders in the United States have created an optimal situation for the use of telehealth services for non-life-threatening health care use. A retrospective cohort study was performed using Kantar's Claritisâ„¢ database, which links insurance claims encounters (Komodo Health) with patient-reported data (Kantar Health, National Health &amp; Wellness Survey). Logistic regression models (odds ratios [OR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]) examined predictors of telehealth versus in-person encounters. Adults ages â‰¥18 years eligible for payer-complete health care encounters in both March 2019 and March 2020 were identified (nâ€‰=â€‰35,376). Telehealth use increased from 0.2% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020. In adjusted models of respondents with â‰¥1 health care encounter (nâ€‰=â€‰11,614), age, marital status, geographic residence (region; urban/rural), and presence of anxiety or depression were significant predictors of telehealth compared with in-person use in March 2020. For example, adults 45-46 years versus 18-44 years were less likely to use telehealth (OR 0.684, 95% CI: 0.561-0.834), and respondents living in urban versus rural areas were more likely to use telehealth (OR 1.543, 95% CI: 1.153-2.067). Substantial increases in telehealth use were observed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; however, disparities existed. These inequalities represent the baseline landscape that population health management must monitor and address during this pandemic.","Jaffe, Lee, Huynh, Haskell","https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2020.0186","20200820","COVID-19; health inequalities; pandemic; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"What the world could learn from the Haitian resilience while managing COVID-19","In the 1st trimester of 2020, there were mixed feelings among Haitians about the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In effect, many of the concerns emanating from the relatively weak health infrastructure in Haiti were analyzed from a resilience perspective. Many professionals living in Haiti with whom we have conversed believe that Haitians were better prepared to cope with the social distancing and mental health outcomes associated with the pandemic because of their 3-month exposure to the effects of Peyi LÃ²k (&quot;country in lockdown&quot;) as well as previous major natural disasters. In that regard, previous traumatic exposures may serve as a buffer against the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Haitians. For the past 3 months, Haitians have naturally adopted a practical posture to cope with the pandemic where only school buildings are closed. Consequently, we remain convinced that from a psychological perspective, individuals from high-income countries that are severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic could learn from the Haitian way of coping with large-scale disasters.

"The COVID-19 telepsychology revolution: A national study of pandemic-based changes in US mental health care delivery","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered mental health care delivery like no other event in modern history. The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.

It will have far reaching impact on the individual, their family and their care providers. Frontline healthcare workers and those with pre-existing mental health difficulties are recognised at increased risk.

"The mental health of immigrants and refugees: Canadian evidence from a nationally linked database","Few studies of the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) have examined the mental health outcomes of Canadian-born individuals on a national scale compared with immigrants by admission category. This study fills this gap by examining the self-reported mental health (SRMH) of immigrants by admission category and other immigration dimensions (e.g., source world region and duration since landing) and making comparisons with Canadian-born respondents to a population-based survey. Based on four cycles (2011 to 2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), odds ratios of high (i.e., excellent or very good) SRMH among Canadian-born respondents and IMDB-linked immigrants are compared using logistic regression. Among the IMDB immigrant population, high SRMH was also examined according to the above-mentioned immigration dimensions. Adjusted results were hierarchically controlled for age, sex, social and economic factors, and sense of belonging. Age-sex adjusted results show that immigrants, especially refugees, are less likely than the Canadian-born population to report high mental health levels, but these differences disappeared after full adjustment. The odds of immigrants having high SRMH differed more by source world region and duration since landing. For example, fully adjusted results show support for the HIE, with recent immigrants (interviewed within 10 years of landing) more likely to report high SRMH than either the Canadian-born population or established immigrants. Greater odds of high SRMH among recent immigrants also holds across admission classes and for selected world regions. This study provides new evidence on differences in mental health between Canadian-born individuals and immigrants by various characteristics. Results support a deterioration of the HIE in SRMH and identify factors significantly associated with SRMH. This study can also serve as a baseline for further studies on the impact of COVID-19 on immigrants' mental health by immigrant category.","Ng, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000800001-eng","20200902","healthy immigrant effect; immigrant category; linked data; mental health; refugee; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Canada; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Emigrants and Immigrants; Emigration and Immigration; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Refugees; Self Report; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Acute stress disorder among frontline health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak: A structural equation modelling investigation","The outbreak of COVID-19 that commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused extensive public health concerns and posed substantial challenges to health professionals, especially for those in the center of the epidemic. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21Â±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient Î²=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, Duan, Peng, Li, Ou, Wilson, Wang, Si, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000851","20200820",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

To understand the implications of this drastic change for mental health care, and to improve the online care offerings, an online qualitative survey was held among mental health care professionals in Netherlands (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰51). Our findings indicate that technological and usability problems pose a significant challenge, as do difficulties to establish rapport with clients. Moreover, not all mental health issues and treatment forms are equally amenable to online interaction. In contrast, in many instances, practitioners were positive about the effectiveness of treatment, and reported flexibility, a lower threshold for contact, and lack of travel time as advantages. Their most prominent needs concern better technological, organizational, and logistical support. It is critical that these needs are acted upon by institutions and governments. In addition, current results inform future research on the improvement of e-mental health technologies.","Feijt, de Kort, Bongers, Bierbooms, Westerink, IJsselsteijn","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0370","20200820","COVID-19; e-health; mental health care; online psychological treatment; practitioners' experiences; teletherapy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological responses and lifestyle changes among pregnant women with respect to the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a profound impact on health and well-being of populations. However, there are limited studies that have investigated the psychological aspects of vulnerable groups including pregnant women amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese pregnant women from February 2020 until March 2020. Our study was conducted using a modified validated online questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic, the Impact of Event Scale (IES), attitude and mental health-related questions towards COVID-19. A total of 560 women were included. The overall mean age and IES of women was 25.8 Â± 2.7â€‰years and 31.4 Â± 13.7. Moreover, 67.1% of them had IES â©¾26. Psychological impact seemed to be more severe in women in second trimester of pregnancy (the highest IES) (<i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.016). There was a significant association between trimesters of pregnancy and some indicators of negative health impacts (including increased stress from work, increased stress from home, feeling apprehensive and helpless during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic) (all <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.05). Our results reported moderate-to-severe stressful impact among Chinese pregnant women. We recommend that appropriate measures should be taken to address the maternal mental health issues.","Zhang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020952116","20200826","China; IES; Stress; mental health; pregnant women","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 and eating disorders during confinement: Analysis of factors associated with resilience and aggravation of symptoms","To assess the level of deterioration in functioning of ED patients during confinement, due to COVID-19, and examine potential contributing factors (coping strategies, anxiety-depressive symptomatology and personality traits). A total of 74 ED patients in treatment before the COVID-19 outbreak, contributed to this study. Baseline pre-treatment evaluation included the SCL-90R, TCI-R, EDI-2 and Y-FAS 2.0 questionnaires for general psychopathology, personality and ED severity indexes. ED symptoms, coping strategies, socio-demographic data and COVID-19 concerns were collected by clinicians through a semi-structured telephone survey during lockdown. A deterioration in ED symptoms and general psychopathology (anxiety and depression), during lockdown, was associated with low self-directedness. Higher ED symptomatology during confinement was associated with less-adaptive coping strategies to deal with lockdown situation leading to an increase in weight. These specific vulnerability factors to further confinement or stressful situations may help design personalized preventive and therapeutic approaches.","Baenas, Caravaca-Sanz, Granero, SÃ¡nchez, Riesco, Testa, VintrÃ³-Alcaraz, Treasure, JimÃ©nez-Murcia, FernÃ¡ndez-Aranda","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2771","20200903","COVID-19; confinement; eating disorders; mental health; personality","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Subjective burden and perspectives of German healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare workers (HCW) face tremendous challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the subjective burden, views, and COVID-19 infection status of HCWs. The aim of this work was toÂ evaluate the subjective burden, the perception of the information policies, and the agreement on structural measures in a large cohort of German HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. This country-wide anonymous online survey was carried out from April 15th until May 1st, 2020. 25 content-related questions regarding the subjective burden and other dimensions were evaluated. We evaluated different dimensions of subjective burden, stress, and perspectives using 5-point Likert-scale questions. Moreover, the individual COVID-19 infection status, the amount of people infected in circle of friends and acquaintances and the hours working overtime were assessed. A total of 3669 HCWs provided sufficient responses for analyses. 2.8% of HCWs reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19. Nurses reported in principle higher ratings on all questions of subjective burden and stress than doctors and other hospital staff. Doctors (3.6%) and nurses (3.1%) were more likely to be tested positive for COVID-19 than other hospital staff (0.6%, Chi<sub>(2)</sub><sup>2</sup> â€‰=â€‰17.39, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0005). HCWs who worked in a COVID-19 environment reported higher levels of subjective burden and stress compared to all other participants. Working in a COVID-19 environment increased the likelihood to be tested positive for COVID-19 (4.8% vs. 2.3%, Chi<sub>(1)</sub><sup>2</sup> â€‰=â€‰12.62, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.0005) and the severity of the subjective burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses experience more stress than doctors.

"Migrant workers in China need emergency psychological interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been found in more than 200 countries worldwide since December, 2019. In China, a major reason for the rapid transmission of the COVID-19 in early stage of the outbreak is the huge numbers of passengers boarding their &quot;last train home&quot; to meet family members during the Spring Festival. Most of these travelers were internal migrant workers. In order to reduce the risk of the COVID-19 transmission, public transportation networks were suspended, and many migrant workers who returned to their hometowns needed to be quarantined for 2 weeks, which led to the delay of returning back to cities to work. Many businesses have temporarily closed because of the risk of COVID-19 transmission, leading to unemployment of many workers. Sudden loss of income and further quarantine enforcement in cities can exacerbate existing mental health problems or trigger new mental disorders among affected migrant workers. However, to date no specific guidelines or strategies about mental health services of migrant workers have been released. Health authorities and professionals should pay more attention to this vulnerable group and provide timely mental health service support for those in need.","Liu, Zhao, Feng, Zhang, Zhong, Cheung, Hall, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00608-w","20200825","COVID-19; China; Mental health; Migrant workers; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergency Services, Psychiatric; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Transients and Migrants","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Seven COVID-19 priorities for health services and policy research were identified: system adaptation and organization of care; resource allocation decision-making and ethics; rapid synthesis and comparative policy analysis of the COVID-19 response and outcomes; healthcare workforce; virtual care; long-term consequences of the pandemic; and public and patient engagement. Three additional cross-cutting themes were identified: supporting the health of Indigenous Peoples and vulnerable populations, data and digital infrastructure, and learning health systems and knowledge platforms. IHSPR hopes these research priorities will contribute to the broader ecosystem for collective research investment and action.","McMahon, Nadigel, Thompson, Glazier","https://doi.org/10.12927/hcpol.2020.26249","20200825","Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Research","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The emotional impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with progressive multiple sclerosis","Individuals with pre-existing chronic illness have shown increased anxiety and depression due to COVID-19. Here, we examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on emotional symptomatology and quality of life in individuals with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PMS). Data were obtained during a randomized clinical trial on rehabilitation taking place at 11 centers in North America and Europe. Participants included 131 individuals with PMS. Study procedures were interrupted in accordance with governmental restrictions as COVID-19 spread. During study closure, a COVID Impact Survey was administered via telephone or email to all participants, along with measures of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and MS symptomatology that were previously administered pre-pandemic. 4% of respondents reported COVID-19 infection. No significant changes were noted in anxiety, quality of life, or the impact of MS symptomatology on daily life from baseline to lockdown. While total HADS-depression scores increased significantly at follow-up, this did not translate into more participants scoring above the HADS threshold for clinically significant depression.Â No significant relationships were noted between disease duration, processing speed ability or EDSS, and changes in symptoms of depression or anxiety. Most participants reported the impact of the virus on their psychological well-being, with a little impact on financial well-being. The perceived impact of the pandemic on physical and psychological well-being was correlated with the impact of MS symptomatology on daily life, as well as changes in depression. Overall, little change was noted in symptoms of depression or anxiety or overall quality of life.","Chiaravalloti, Amato, Brichetto, Chataway, Dalgas, DeLuca, Meza, Moore, Feys, Filippi, Freeman, Inglese, Motl, Rocca, Sandroff, Salter, Cutter, Feinstein","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-10160-7","20200821","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Progressive multiple sclerosis; Quality of life","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Debate: Recognising and responding to the mental health needs of young people in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is a 'perfect storm' for the mental health of young people, because of exposure to known risk factors for psychopathology and lack of support from the infrastructures that are normally in place to ensure safety and provide support. However, it is yet unclear if this 'perfect storm' will flood the Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health Services. The early, normative emotional responses observed may not lead to enduring psychopathology in most young people. Nevertheless, a minority of young people may show complex presentations, particularly in relation to bereavement.

"Psychedelic Science in Post-Covid Psychiatry","The medium to long term consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known, though an increase in mental health problems are predicted. Multidisciplinary strategies across socio-economic and psychological levels may be needed to mitigate the mental health burden of COVID-19. Preliminary evidence from the rapidly progressing field of psychedelic science, shows that psilocybin assisted psychotherapy (PAP), offers a promising trans-diagnostic treatment strategy for a range of disorders with restricted and maladaptive habitual patterns of cognition and behaviour, notably depression, addiction and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The COMPASS pathways, phase 2b double blind trial of PAP in antidepressant-free, treatment resistant depression (TRD) is underway across 19 research sites, to determine the safety, efficacy and optimal dose of psilocybin. Results from the Imperial College London Psilodep-RCT comparing the efficacy and mechanisms of action of PAP to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram will soon be published. However, the efficacy and safety of PAP in conjunction with SSRIs in TRD is not yet known. A new COMPASS study, with a centre in Dublin, will answer this question, with implications for the future delivery of PAP. While at an early stage of clinical development, and notwithstanding the immense challenges of COVID-19, PAP is likely to play an important therapeutic role for certain disorders in post COVID-19 clinical psychiatry.","Kelly, Crockett, Alexander, Haran, Baker, Burke, Brennan, O'Keane","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.94","20200819","COVID-19; Depression; coronavirus; psilocybin; psychedelics; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; treatment-resistant depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Telehealth Beyond COVID-19","Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health care services have been shifted from face-to-face to virtual interactions. Several health policy changes have influenced telehealth uptake during this time, including changes in technology, Internet connectivity, prescriptions, and reimbursement for services. These changes have been implemented for the duration of the pandemic, and it is unclear if all, some, or none of these new or amended policies will be retained after the pandemic has ended. Accordingly, in the wake of changing policies, mental health care providers will need to make decisions about the future of their telehealth programs. This article briefly reviews telehealth policy changes due to the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights what providers should consider for future delivery and implementation of their telehealth programs.","Haque","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000368","20200819","COVID-19; Mental health; Public policy issues; Telecommunications; Telehealth; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"[Effects on the integrated treatment of colorectal cancer patients during COVID-19 epidemic in China: a cross-sectional study]","<b>Objective:</b> To understand the treatment status and effects on colorectal cancer (CRC) patients in China during the COVID-19 pandemic, and provide evidence for decision-making for health-care workers. <b>Methods:</b> The method of cross-sectional study was applied. A questionnaire survey of CRC patients in China was carried out. Their basic and treatment information during the COVID-19 were collected and associated effects on treatment, nursing, state of psychology and needs of social support were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Of the 1147 participants in the study, 635 (55.4%) were male and 512 (44.6%) were female with mean age of (52.8Â±12.8) years. The treatment or follow up of 896 (78.1%) CRC patients were affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 253 patients (22.1%) had their treatment regiments changed, of whom 141 (12.3%) had their chemotherapy regiments postponed or changed, and 83 patients (7.2%) had their surgical treatment affected. Among the above 83 patients, 39 patients (3.4%) underwent emergency surgery. A total of 277 patients (24.1%) had their out-of-hospital care needs affected, mainly due to maintenance of PICC (49.5%, 137/277). CRC patients had poorer sleep quality and increased levels of insomnia than before (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001), and were more distressed, anxious, depressed, and angry than they were before. They presented the more requirements of help (<i>P</i>&lt;0.001). In addition, 376 patients (32.8%) had received telemedicine services, but only 36.4% (137/376) of them were satisfied. <b>Conclusions:</b> The COVID-19 epidemic has effect on the integrated treatment of CRC patients include diagnosis, treatment, examination and prognosis. While protecting CRC patients from being infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care workers should also actively help them to receive timely and correct treatment and pay attention to their nursing, nutritional, psychological and social support needs in the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>ç›®çš„ï¼š</b> åœ¨æ–°åž‹å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’è‚ºç‚Žï¼ˆæ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žï¼‰ç–«æƒ…é˜²æŽ§æœŸé—´ï¼Œæ¶æ€§è‚¿ç˜¤æ‚£è€…çš„æ­£å¸¸è¯Šç–—è¿‡ç¨‹å—åˆ°ä¸¥é‡å½±å“ã€‚æœ¬æ–‡è°ƒæŸ¥ä¸­å›½ç»“ç›´è‚ ç™Œæ‚£è€…åœ¨æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´æ²»ç–—æƒ…å†µåŠå—å½±å“ç¨‹åº¦ï¼Œä¸ºåŒ»æŠ¤äººå‘˜åˆ¶å®šæ›´ç²¾å‡†çš„åŒ»ç–—å†³ç­–æä¾›ä¾æ®ã€‚ <b>æ–¹æ³•ï¼š</b> è¿ç”¨æ¨ªæ–­é¢ç ”ç©¶æ–¹æ³•ï¼Œé‡‡å–ä¾¿åˆ©æŠ½æ ·æ–¹æ³•åœ¨å…¨å›½èŒƒå›´å†…å¯¹ç»“ç›´è‚ ç™Œæ‚£è€…è¿›è¡Œé—®å·è°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œæ”¶é›†å…¶åŸºæœ¬ä¿¡æ¯å’Œåœ¨æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´çš„æ²»ç–—ä¿¡æ¯ï¼Œå¹¶äº†è§£å…¶åœ¨ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´æŠ¤ç†ã€ç²¾ç¥žå¿ƒç†ã€ç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒç­‰æ–¹é¢çš„å½±å“ç¨‹åº¦å’Œéœ€æ±‚æƒ…å†µã€‚ <b>ç»“æžœï¼š</b> å…±1 147ä¾‹ç»“ç›´è‚ ç™Œæ‚£è€…çº³å…¥ç ”ç©¶ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­ç”·æ€§635ä¾‹ï¼ˆ55.4%ï¼‰ï¼Œå¥³æ€§512ä¾‹ï¼ˆ44.6%ï¼‰ï¼Œå¹´é¾„ï¼ˆ52.8Â±12.8ï¼‰å²ã€‚78.1%ï¼ˆ896/1 147ï¼‰çš„ç»“ç›´è‚ ç™Œæ‚£è€…è¡¨ç¤ºä»–ä»¬çš„æ²»ç–—æˆ–å¤æŸ¥è¿‡ç¨‹å—åˆ°å½±å“ã€‚253ä¾‹ï¼ˆ22.1%ï¼‰æ²»ç–—æ–¹æ¡ˆè¢«è¿«æ›´æ¢ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­æŽ¨è¿Ÿæˆ–æ›´æ¢åŒ–ç–—æ–¹æ¡ˆè€…141ä¾‹ï¼ˆ12.3%ï¼‰ï¼›å…±æœ‰83ä¾‹ï¼ˆ7.2%ï¼‰æ‰‹æœ¯æ²»ç–—å—åˆ°å½±å“ï¼Œæœ‰39ä¾‹ï¼ˆ3.4%ï¼‰è¿›è¡Œäº†æ€¥è¯Šæ‰‹æœ¯ã€‚æœ‰277ä¾‹ï¼ˆ24.1%ï¼‰çš„é™¢å¤–æŠ¤ç†éœ€æ±‚å—åˆ°å½±å“ï¼Œæœ€ä¸»è¦æ˜¯å¤–å‘¨é™è„‰æ¤å…¥ä¸­å¿ƒé™è„‰å¯¼ç®¡ç»´æŠ¤é—®é¢˜ï¼ˆ49.5%ï¼Œ137/277ï¼‰ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ä¸Žç–«æƒ…å‰ç›¸æ¯”ï¼Œæ‚£è€…ç¡çœ è´¨é‡æ›´å·®ï¼Œè‹¦æ¼ã€ç„¦è™‘ã€æŠ‘éƒå’Œæ„¤æ€’ç­‰æƒ…ç»ªå‡æ¯”ç–«æƒ…å‰ä¸¥é‡ï¼Œå¹¶ä¸”æ›´éœ€è¦å¾—åˆ°å¸®åŠ©ï¼ˆå‡<i>P</i>&lt;0.001ï¼‰ã€‚æœ‰376ä¾‹ï¼ˆ32.8%ï¼‰è¿›è¡Œè¿‡è¿œç¨‹åŒ»ç–—æœåŠ¡ï¼Œä½†å…¶ä¸­ä»…æœ‰36.4%ï¼ˆ137/376ï¼‰å¯¹è¿œç¨‹åŒ»ç–—è¡¨ç¤ºæ»¡æ„ã€‚ <b>ç»“è®ºï¼š</b> æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žç–«æƒ…å¯¹ç»“ç›´è‚ ç™Œæ‚£è€…çš„å½±å“æ˜¯å¤šæ–¹é¢çš„ï¼ŒåŒ…æ‹¬è¯Šæ–­ã€æ²»ç–—ã€å¤æŸ¥åŠé¢„åŽç­‰ã€‚å°½ç®¡è¿œç¨‹åŒ»ç–—çš„å‡ºçŽ°ç¼“è§£äº†ä¸€éƒ¨åˆ†å°±è¯ŠåŽ‹åŠ›ï¼Œä½†æ˜¯ä»éœ€æ”¹è¿›å’ŒåŠ å¼ºã€‚åŒ»åŠ¡å·¥ä½œè€…åœ¨ä¿æŠ¤ç»“ç›´è‚ ç™Œæ‚£è€…é¿å…æ„ŸæŸ“æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žçš„åŒæ—¶ï¼Œä¹Ÿè¦ç§¯æžå¸®åŠ©ä»–ä»¬åŠæ—¶æŽ¥å—è§„èŒƒæ²»ç–—ï¼Œå¹¶å…³æ³¨å…¶ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´çš„æŠ¤ç†ã€è¥å…»ã€ç²¾ç¥žå¿ƒç†åŠç¤¾ä¼šæ”¯æŒç­‰éœ€æ±‚ã€‚.","Yang, Gao, Chen, Wang, Chen, Song, Gu","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200416-00219","20200821","COVID-19; Colorectal neoplasms; Cross-sectional study; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Colorectal Neoplasms; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Nurses' experiences regarding shift patterns in isolation wards during the COVID-19 pandemic in China: A qualitative study","To explore nurses' experiences regarding shift patterns while providing front-line care for COVID-19 patients in isolation wards of hospitals in Shanghai and Wuhan during the novel coronavirus pandemic. Our findings will help to optimize shift work scheduling, use the existing nursing workforce more efficiently, and improve nursing quality. Nurses are one of the main professionals fighting against COVID-19. Providing care for COVID-19 patients is challenging. In isolation wards, the workload has increased, and the workflow and shift patterns are completely different from the usual. More importantly, there is a shortage of nurses. Therefore, it is essential and urgent to arrange nurses' shifts correctly and use the existing workforce resources efficiently. A qualitative descriptive study of 14 nurses in Chinese hospitals was conducted. Semi-structured interviews were used based on the phenomenological research method; data was analyzed using Colaizzi's method of data analysis. This study aligns with the COREQ checklist. Four themes were extracted: assess the competency of nurses to assign nursing work scientifically and reasonably, reorganize nursing workflow to optimize shift patterns, communicate between managers and front-line nurses to humanize shift patterns, and nurses' various feelings and views on shift patterns. It is necessary to arrange shift patterns scientifically and allocate workforce rationally to optimize nursing workforce allocation, reduce nurses' workload, improve nursing quality, and promote physical and mental health among nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study emphasized nurses' experiences on shift patterns in isolation wards, providing useful information to manage shift patterns. Nursing managers should arrange shifts scientifically, allocate nursing workforce rationally, formulate emergency plans, and establish emergency response rosters during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Gao, Jiang, Hu, Li, Hou","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15464","20200903","COVID-19; Nurses; nursing workforce; qualitative study; shift work schedule","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of COVID-19 on Public Mental Health and the Buffering Effect of a Sense of Coherence","It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","SchÃ¤fer, Sopp, Schanz, Staginnus, GÃ¶ritz, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1159/000510752","20200818","COVID-19; Mental health; Prospective; Psychopathology; Sense of coherence","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Patient Satisfaction with Use of Telemedicine in University Clinic of Psychiatry: Skopje, North Macedonia During COVID-19 Pandemic"," <b> <i>Background:</i> </b> <i>There is increasing interest in the use of telemedicine as a means of health care delivery especially in circumstances of pandemics. This is partly because technological advances have made the equipment less expensive and simpler to use and partly because increasing health care costs and patient expectations have increased the need to find alternative modes of health care delivery.</i> <b> <i>Introduction:</i> </b> <i>Telemedicine and telepsychiatry, in particular, are rapidly becoming important delivery approaches to providing clinical care and information to patients in cases wherein the medical resources and the patients are very hard to be brought together with respect to rules of behavior in case of epidemics.</i> <i>The reliance on technology to bridge the obstacles between the patients (consumers) and medical resources (providers) can create problems that impact service delivery and outcomes, but in cases such as this (COVID-19 pandemics), this is virtually the only tool for providing clinical care and information to patients.</i> <b> <i>Materials and Methods:</i> </b> <i>A client satisfaction survey was undertaken in a daily hospital (a part of University Clinic of Psychiatry in Skopje).

"COVID-19 in Portugal: exploring the immediate psychological impact on the general population","Like previous pandemics, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has direct and indirect effects, including in mental health. To evaluate the immediate psychological impact of COVID-19, we conducted an online survey in Portugal (24-27 March 2020), using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). From the 10,529 participants (MÂ =Â 31.33; SDÂ =Â 9.73), 83.4% were women, had a mean age of 31.2Â years, and 70.9% were active workers. Depression, anxiety, and stress were rated as moderate to severe in 11.7%, 16.9%, and 5.6% of the sample, respectively. Moreover, 49.2% of participants reported a moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak. Women, the unemployed, those with lower education, living in rural areas, and with flu-like symptoms or chronic disorders were risk factors. Further research is needed to identify vulnerable groups to better inform and adapt mental health policies and interventions.","Paulino, Dumas-Diniz, Brissos, Brites, Alho, SimÃµes, Silva","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1808236","20200818","Anxiety; community; covid-19; depression; early; pandemic; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Coronaphobia among healthcare professionals in Mexico: A psychometric analysis","The present study examined the validity of the coronaphobia phenomenon with healthcare professionals using a psychometric approach. Using SurveyMonkey, an adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale-Healthcare version (CAS-HC) was administered to 231 adult healthcare professionals in Mexico. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety symptoms cohered into a reliable, single factor structure of coronaphobia. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the classification features of the CAS-HC were strong, but supported a less stringent cut-score for this population. Construct validity was supported by the positive correlations between the CAS-HC and measures of depression and generalized anxiety, while known groups validity was found with high CAS-HC scores exhibited by those working in emergency rooms, triage, and intensive care units. The findings collectively support the coronaphobia construct with healthcare professionals, and the finding that over one third of the participants in the study scored in the clinical range on this measure points to the critical importance of assessing and alleviating this form of distress in this vulnerable but indispensable workforce.","Mora-MagaÃ±a, Lee, Maldonado-Castellanos, JimÃ©nez-Gutierrez, Mendez-Venegas, Maya-Del-Moral, Rosas-Munive, Mathis, Jobe","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2020.1808762","20200818",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Assessment of Mental Health Factors among Health Professionals Depending on Their Contact with COVID-19 Patients","It seems that the medical personnel in contact with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are at an especially high risk of adverse psychological effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the mental health factors among healthcare workers by quantifying the severity of anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders during the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, while taking into account coexisting diseases. The study involved 441 healthcare professionals including 206 healthcare workers at emergency wards, infectious wards, and intensive care units. The control group consisted of 235 healthcare workers working in wards other than those where individuals from the study group worked. Regression adjusted by age, gender, the occurrence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, asthma, autoimmune diseases, and cigarette smoking showed the elevated risk of anxiety on the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (OR = 1.934; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), depression on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale (OR = 2.623; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and sleep disorders on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale (OR = 3.078; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Effects of COVID-19 on College Students' Mental Health in the United States: Interview Survey Study","Student mental health in higher education has been an increasing concern. The COVID-19 pandemic situation has brought this vulnerable population into renewed focus. Our study aims to conduct a timely assessment of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of college students. We conducted interview surveys with 195 students at a large public university in the United States to understand the effects of the pandemic on their mental health and well-being. The data were analyzed through quantitative and qualitative methods. Of the 195 students, 138 (71%) indicated increased stress and anxiety due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple stressors were identified that contributed to the increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive thoughts among students. These included fear and worry about their own health and of their loved ones (177/195, 91% reported negative impacts of the pandemic), difficulty in concentrating (173/195, 89%), disruptions to sleeping patterns (168/195, 86%), decreased social interactions due to physical distancing (167/195, 86%), and increased concerns on academic performance (159/195, 82%). To cope with stress and anxiety, participants have sought support from others and helped themselves by adopting either negative or positive coping mechanisms. Due to the long-lasting pandemic situation and onerous measures such as lockdown and stay-at-home orders, the COVID-19 pandemic brings negative impacts on higher education. The findings of our study highlight the urgent need to develop interventions and preventive strategies to address the mental health of college students.","Son, Hegde, Smith, Wang, Sasangohar","https://doi.org/10.2196/21279","20200903","COVID-19; anxiety; college student; mental health; pandemic; self-management; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Interpersonal violence against people with disabilities: Additional concerns and considerations in the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective/Purpose: The objective of this article is to provide information about the ways in which the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may affect the ongoing public health issue of violence against people with disabilities and how rehabilitation psychologists and other providers can address these concerns in their practice. This article reviews the literature on violence against people with disabilities as well as emerging literature on the COVID-19 pandemic and its social and medical consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic magnifies existing issues and barriers facing people with disabilities who are experiencing interpersonal violence. These issues include reliance on the perpetrator for care and assistance, barriers to reporting abuse and seeking help, fear of retaliation and other negative consequences if abuse is reported, emotional abuse related to disability, and exacerbation of secondary physical and mental health sequalae of abuse. The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences enhance the already increased risk for abuse among people with disabilities. Providers who work with individuals with disabilities should address these issues at both the individual client and systems levels.

"Early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health care and on people with mental health conditions: framework synthesis of international experiences and responses","The COVID-19 pandemic has many potential impacts on people with mental health conditions and on mental health care, including direct consequences of infection, effects of infection control measures and subsequent societal changes. We aimed to map early impacts of the pandemic on people with pre-existing mental health conditions and services they use, and to identify individual and service-level strategies adopted to manage these. We searched for relevant material in the public domain published before 30 April 2020, including papers in scientific and professional journals, published first person accounts, media articles, and publications by governments, charities and professional associations. Search languages were English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Relevant content was retrieved and summarised via a rapid qualitative framework synthesis approach. We found 872 eligible sources from 28 countries. Most documented observations and experiences rather than reporting research data. We found many reports of deteriorations in symptoms, and of impacts of loneliness and social isolation and of lack of access to services and resources, but sometimes also of resilience, effective self-management and peer support. Immediate service challenges related to controlling infection, especially in inpatient and residential settings, and establishing remote working, especially in the community. We summarise reports of swiftly implemented adaptations and innovations, but also of pressing ethical challenges and concerns for the future. Our analysis captures the range of stakeholder perspectives and experiences publicly reported in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in several countries. We identify potential foci for service planning and research.","Sheridan Rains, Johnson, Barnett, Steare, Needle, Carr, Lever Taylor, Bentivegna, Edbrooke-Childs, Scott, Rees, Shah, Lomani, Chipp, Barber, Dedat, Oram, Morant, Simpson, Papamichail, Moore, Jeffery, De Estrada, Hallam, Lloyd-Evans, Contreras, Serna, Ntephe, Lamirel, Cooke, Pearce, Lemmel, Koutsoubelis, Cragnolini, Harju-SeppÃ¤nen, Wang, Botham, Abdou, Krause, Turner, Poursanidou, Gruenwald, Jagmetti, Mazzocchi, Tomaskova, Montagnese, MahÃ©, Schlief, GÃ¼nak, Leverton, Lyons, Vera, Gao, Griffiths, Lane, Busato, Ledden, Mac-Ginty, Hardt, Orlando, Gillard, Jeynes, OndruÅ¡kovÃ¡, Stefanidou, Foye, Tzouvara, Cavero","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01924-7","20200819","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Framework synthesis mental health services; Mental health; Pandemic; Service user experiences","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Past Epidemics, Natural Disasters, COVID19, and Mental Health: Learning from History as we Deal with the Present and Prepare for the Future","As cases of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continue to rise, psychological endurance is a challenge many people will face. For mental health, heightened stress responses to the pandemic, is likely to manifest in three ways: 1) development of a new episode of a disorder in those with a predisposition to a major psychiatric disorder or an acute exacerbation in those who already have such a disorder, 2) development of a trauma or stressor related disorder, such as acute stress disorder, Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), or adjustment disorders, and 3) development of a symptomatic stress response that does not meet the diagnostic criteria of a psychiatric disorder. The authors reviewed existing literature on past epidemics, natural disasters, and COVID-19 with a focus on psychiatry and mental health. Psychological effects of past epidemics (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV-1, Ebola, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, the Anthrax threat), past natural disasters, and current COVID-19 data suggest numerous psychological effects following the pandemic. Alcohol use, PTSD, anxiety, anger, fear of contagion, perceived risk, uncertainty, and distrust are a few of the immediate and long-term effects that are likely to result from the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying people in need of mental health care and determining the appropriate psychiatric services and therapy needed will be important. Increasing the use and availability of telehealth, group meetings, and online resources are some ways that health care workers can prepare for the increasing demand of psychiatric services during and following the pandemic.","Esterwood, Saeed","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09808-4","20200819","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; Stress response","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Public in Egypt","This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping among the public in Egypt during the novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic. An online snowball sampling approach was used to collect data from netizens in four Egyptian governorates between 16 and 30 April 2020. A semi-structured questionnaire was designed to assess sociodemographic characteristics, sleeping hours per day, and psychological disturbances (depression, anxiety, and stress) of participants using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Out of 1629 participants, 48.1% were aged â‰¤â€‰30Â years, 42.4% were men, and 20.0% were working in the health sector. The participants reported a high prevalence of depression (67.1%: mild to moderate 44.6% and severe to very severe 22.5%), anxiety (53.5%: mild to moderate 30.6% and severe to very severe 22.9%), stress (48.8%: mild to moderate 33.8% and severe to very severe 15.0%), and inadequate sleeping (&lt;â€‰6Â h/day) 23.1%. Female sex, working in sectors other than the health sector, watching/reading COVID-19 news â‰¥â€‰2Â h/day, and lack of emotional support from family and society were associated with a high prevalence of severe to very severe depression, anxiety, and stress. In conclusion, the psychological impacts of COVID-19 on the public in Egypt were enormous, therefore, providing psychological support and counsel is warranted.","Arafa, Mohamed, Saleh, Senosy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00701-9","20200819","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Inadequate sleeping; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Operating room efficiency and timing during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in a referral orthopaedic hospital in Northern Italy","The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak affected health care systems at different levels with important consequences on health, economy, and social structures. This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy. The timeframe chosen for the current analysis was April 2020, to be compared with the corresponding period in 2019. Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities. The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time.","Andreata, Faraldi, Bucci, Lombardi, Zagra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04772-x","20200819","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Efficiency; Operating room; Orthopaedic trauma; Performance indicators","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The social underpinnings of mental distress in the time of COVID-19 - time for urgent action","We argue that predictions of a 'tsunami' of mental health problems as a consequence of the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the lockdown are overstated; feelings of anxiety and sadness are entirely normal reactions to difficult circumstances, not symptoms of poor mental health.Â Some people will need specialised mental health support, especially those already leading tough lives; we need immediate reversal of years of underfunding of community mental health services.Â However, the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on the most disadvantaged, especially BAME people placed at risk by their social and economic conditions, were entirely predictable. Mental health is best ensured by urgently rebuilding the social and economic supports stripped away over the last decade. Governments must pump funds into local authorities to rebuild community services, peer support, mutual aid and local community and voluntary sector organisations.Â Health care organisations must tackle racism and discrimination to ensure genuine equal access to universal health care.Â Government must replace highly conditional benefit systems by something like a universal basic income. All economic and social policies must be subjected to a legally binding mental health audit.Â This may sound unfeasibly expensive, but the social and economic costs, not to mention the costs in personal and community suffering, though often invisible, are far greater.","Rose, Manning, Bentall, Bhui, Burgess, Carr, Cornish, Devakumar, Dowd, Ecks, Faulkner, Ruck Keene, Kirkbride, Knapp, Lovell, Martin, Moncrieff, Parr, Pickersgill, Richardson, Sheard","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.16123.1","20200820","BAME; Mental distress; benefit system reform; social disadvantage; universal basic income","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

She asks, particularly, how psychological therapies are positioned during such a crisis, and whether the pressures of triage and emergency can leave time and space for sustained emotional and psychological care. She wonders how psychoanalytic time with its sustaining rhythm can be held onto in the face of the need for triage on the one hand and the flight to online and telephone delivery on the other. Above all, the author questions how the apparent suspension of time during lockdown is belied by the onward pressure of adolescent time, and how this can be understood by, and alongside, troubled adolescents.","Catty","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15961.1","20200819","Adolescent mental health; COVID-19 pandemic; deliberate self-harm; psychoanalytic psychotherapy; quarantine; temporality in health care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Standard public health measures, such as &quot;stay-at-home&quot; orders, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment, are being used to manage the pandemic, and these measures are changing social relationships, including those between doctors and patients. The mental health effects of this confinement can include feelings of isolation and stress-related fear of contamination and death, and psychiatric and/or psychotherapeutic help using telehealth could be beneficial. In Italy, psychological telecounseling has been an effective method of supporting the physical and psychosocial needs of all patients, regardless of their geographical locations.

"Psychological Distress and Signs of Post-Traumatic Stress in Response to the COVID-19 Health Emergency in a Mexican Sample","This study aimed to evaluate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social isolation, on a Mexican sample. We conducted an online sociodemographic and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) survey during the second phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico to evaluate the presence of psychological distress, signs of post-traumatic stress, and to identify the groups at highest risk in the sample. Prevalence of psychological distress at moderate or severe levels in the sample were as follows: 943 (22%) intrusive thoughts, 933 (22.3%) avoidance, and 515 (12.2%) hyperarousal. Furthermore, we found the symptoms of clinically significant post-traumatic stress in 1160 (27.7%) of the participants. The variables positively correlated with higher psychological distress were as follows: age (younger), sex (female), employment (employed), relationship status (single), in social isolation, number of days in isolation, the number of people in the household (3-5), and a perception of a high risk of contracting COVID-19, change in routine, engaging in less activity, and loss of income. During phase 2 of the COVID-19 outbreak in Mexico, we observed the presence of psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms in over a quarter of the population. This investigation may guide mental health interventions and policies towards the groups that are most vulnerable to the impacts of the social and lifestyle changes taking place in Mexico due to COVID-19.","GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, MartÃ­nez Arriaga, HernÃ¡ndez-Gonzalez, De la Roca-Chiapas","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S259563","20200819","Impact of Event Scale-Revised; coronavirus; intrusive thoughts; mental health; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Dental medicine and COVID-19 pandemic","Specific airborne infection with characteristic symptoms - high fever, headache, persisting dry cough, loss of taste and smell and overall tiredness originates from Wuhan in China where it was discovered in December 2019. Due to rapid dissemination the epidemic has become a pandemic caused by coronavirus on March 11 2020. It changed the world over night and made human life different; for some it was the ultimate change. In these fluctuating times the dental medicine, especially in the developed and advancing areas, completely stopped. Responsible behaviour of dentists, aimed at stopping the spread of the virus from dental offices showed that only emergency procedures were to be performed, in cases of toothache, trauma and odontogenic infections that might put organs or systems at risk. At the same time, with the cessation of all types of treatments, there was an immediate cessation of teaching processes in all university settings for dental medicine, since the data from China strongly suggested death rates among doctors and students in close contact with infected persons. Stress and unease that have grown among people due to isolation and quarantine, the only ways of prevention of the spread of the invisible enemy will have long-lasting and visible effect on mental health of the people. Health issues in the oral cavity will most certainly occur due to the lack of regular check-ups and care. Caries and periodontal disease will appear more frequently. While we are expecting an efficient vaccine, the only way to counter the virus are epidemiological measures and responsible behaviour of every individual, in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 virus.","BrkiÄ‡","https://www.google.com/search?q=Dental+medicine+and+COVID-19+pandemic.","20200819","COVID-19; Wuhan; aerosol; coronavirus; dental medicine; pandemic; prevention","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Design and Implementation of a Regional Inpatient Psychiatry Unit for Patients who are Positive for Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2","Patients with psychiatric illnesses are particularly vulnerable to highly contagious, droplet-spread organisms such as SARS-CoV-2. Patients with mental illnesses may not be able to consistently follow up behavioral prescriptions to avoid contagion, and they are frequently found in settings with close contact and inadequate infection control, such as group homes, homeless shelters, residential rehabilitation centers, and correctional facilities. Furthermore, inpatient psychiatry settings are generally designed as communal spaces, with heavy emphasis on group and milieu therapies. As such, inpatient psychiatry services are vulnerable to rampant spread of contagion. With this in mind, the authors outline the decision process and ultimate design and implementation of a regional inpatient psychiatry unit for patients infected with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 and share key points for consideration in implementing future units elsewhere.

"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of &quot;psychosis after chloroquine.&quot; Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice mayÂ include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Rosenthal","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022","20200819","COVID-19; chloroquine; hydroxychloroquine; neuropsychiatry; psychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and initial period of lockdown on the mental health and well-being of adults in the UK","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and well-being were assessed in a convenience sample of 600 UK adults, using a cross-sectional design. Recruited over 2 weeks during the initial phase of lockdown, participants completed an online survey that included COVID-19-related questions, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the World Health Organization (Five) Well-Being Index and the Oxford Capabilities Questionnaire for Mental Health. Self-isolating before lockdown, increased feelings of isolation since lockdown and having COVID-19-related livelihood concerns were associated with poorer mental health, well-being and quality of life.

"Effect of Common Medications on the Expression of SARS-CoV-2 Entry Receptors in Kidney Tissue","Besides the respiratory system, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was shown to affect other essential organs such as the kidneys. Early kidney involvement during the course of infection was associated with worse outcomes, which could be attributed to the direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of kidney cells. In this study, the effect of commonly used medications on the expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)2, and TMPRSS2 protein in kidney tissues was evaluated. This was done by in silico analyses of publicly available transcriptomic databases of kidney tissues of rats treated with multiple doses of commonly used medications. Of 59 tested medications, 56% modified ACE2 expression, whereas 24% modified TMPRSS2 expression. ACE2 was increased with only a few of the tested medication groups, namely the renin-angiotensin inhibitors, such as enalapril, antibacterial agents, such as nitrofurantoin, and the proton pump inhibitor, omeprazole. The majority of the other medications decreased ACE2 expression to variable degrees with allopurinol and cisplatin causing the most noticeable downregulation. The expression level of TMPRSS2 was increased with a number of medications, such as diclofenac, furosemide, and dexamethasone, whereas other medications, such as allopurinol, suppressed the expression of this gene. The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data presented here suggest that we should be vigilant about the potential effects of commonly used medications on kidney tissue expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2.","Saheb Sharif-Askari, Saheb Sharif-Askari, Alabed, Tayoun, Loney, Uddin, Senok, Al Heialy, Hamoudi, Kashour, Alsheikh-Ali, Hamid, Halwani","https://doi.org/10.1111/cts.12862","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Epilepsy in time of COVID-19 a survey-based study","Collateral damage may occur in epilepsy management during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. We aimed to establish the impact of this pandemic on epilepsy patients in terms of patient-reported seizure control and emerging symptoms. Cross-sectional study including consecutive patients assessed by telephone contact in an epilepsy clinic during the first month of confinement. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded and a 19-item questionnaire was systematically completed. Data regarding the impact of confinement, economic effects of the pandemic, and subjective perception of telemedicine were recorded. Additional clinical data were obtained in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Two-hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited: mean age 48.2Â±19.8 years, 121 (47.5%) women. An increase in seizure frequency was reported by 25 (9.8%) patients. Sixty-eight (26.7%) patients reported confinement-related anxiety, 22 (8.6%) depression, 31 (12.2%) both, and 72 (28.2%) insomnia. Seventy-three (28.6%) patients reported a reduction in economic income. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor-related epilepsy etiology [OR=7.36 (95% CI 2.17-24.96)], drug-resistant epilepsy [OR=3.44 (95% CI 1.19-9.95)], insomnia [OR=3.25 (95% CI 1.18-8.96)], fear of epilepsy [OR=3.26 (95% CI 1.09-9.74)], and income reduction [OR=3.65 (95% CI 1.21-10.95)] were associated with a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine was considered satisfactory by 214 (83.9%) patients. Five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with no changes in seizure frequency. The COVID-19 pandemic has effects in epilepsy patients. Patients with tumor-related, drug-resistant epilepsy, insomnia, and economic difficulties are at a higher risk of increased seizure frequency.

"Attitudes and collateral psychological effects of COVID-19 in pregnant women in Colombia","To assess clinical impact, psychological effects, and knowledge of pregnant women during the COVID-19 outbreak in seven cities in Colombia. Currently, there are uncertainty and concerns about the maternal and fetal consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy. A cross-sectional web survey was carried out including pregnant women in seven cities in Colombia. Women were evaluated during the mitigation phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic between April 13 and May 18, 2020. The questions evaluated demographic, knowledge, psychological symptoms, and attitudes data regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1021 patients were invited to participate, obtaining 946 valid surveys for analysis. The rate of psychological consequences of the pandemic was much larger than the number of patients clinically affected by the virus, with 50.4% of the entire cohort reporting symptoms of anxiety, 49.1% insomnia, and 25% reporting depressive symptoms. Poorly informed women were more likely to be younger, affiliated to the subsidized regime, and with lower levels of education. The knowledge of pregnant women about SARS-CoV-2 infection is far from reality and this seems to be associated with an indirect effect on the concern and psychological stress of pregnant women in Colombia.","Parra-Saavedra, Villa-Villa, PÃ©rez-Olivo, Guzman-Polania, Galvis-Centurion, Cumplido-Romero, Santacruz-Vargas, Rivera-Moreno, Molina-Giraldo, Guillen-Burgos, Navarro, FlÃ³rez-Lozano, Barrero-Ortega, Sanz-Cortes, Miranda","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13348","20200817","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Depressive symptoms; Mental health; Pregnancy; Sleep","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis","Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. Online cross-sectional data (nÂ =Â 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study (nÂ =Â 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress. Attention should be given to COVID-19-related fear and coping-skills as they act as potential mediators in emotional suffering during quarantine.","FernÃ¡ndez, Crivelli, Guimet, Allegri, Pedreira","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.133","20200903","COVID-19; Latent profile analysis; Mental Health; Psychological distress; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review","As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (â‰¤40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with highly significant levels of psychological distress that, in many cases, would meet the threshold for clinical relevance.

A total of 19 COVID-19-positive patients aged 11-17 years were identified. Patients most commonly presented with sore throat (37%) and nausea/vomiting (32%). Only 26% of patients presented with cough, shortness of breath, or fever. The most common medical comorbidity was asthma (32%), and the most common psychiatric comorbidity was posttraumatic stress disorder (63%). Infected patients were colocated and managed together on a separate COVID-19 unit to maintain a therapeutic group milieu. Mental health treatment was modified to limit staff exposure. Patients received daily medical assessment by an in-house pediatrician. One patient required intravenous fluids. No patients required transfer to a medical facility. Adolescents in psychiatric inpatient settings may be especially vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. Close collaboration between medical and psychiatric care providers is needed to optimize care for this population and to address admission and disposition options for infected patients.","Krass, Zimbrick-Rogers, Iheagwara, Ford, Calderoni","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.07.009","20200819","Adolescent; COVID-19; Child; Emergency services; Mental health; Psychiatric; Public health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This paper examines how Arab populations reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter over twelve weeks since the outbreak. We conducted a lexicon-based thematic analysis using corpus tools, and LIWC and applied R language's stylo. The dominant themes that were closely related to coronavirus tweets included the outbreak of the pandemic, metaphysics responses, signs and symptoms in confirmed cases, and conspiracism. The psycholinguistic analysis also showed that tweeters maintained high levels of affective talk, which was loaded with negative emotions and sadness. Also, LIWC's psychological categories of religion and health dominated the Arabic tweets discussing the pandemic situation. In addition, the contaminated counties that captured most of the attention of Arabic tweeters were China, the USA, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan. At the same time, China and the USA were instrumental in evoking conspiracist ideation about spreading COVID-19 to the world.","Essam, Abdo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10936-020-09715-6","20200819","COVID-19; LIWC; Pandemic; Psycholinguistics; R language","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Differences in Distress and Coping with the COVID-19 Stressor in Nurses and Physicians","Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, health workers have shown an incredible commitment to their patients, sometimes in apocalyptic conditions. We explored ways to deal with the coronavirus stressor and psychological outcomes among physicians and nurses. 124 healthcare workers in General Hospital Nasice (Croatia) were invited to participate in a study by performing within the period of March 26 to April 6 2020 questionnaire collected information on socio-demographic characteristics and living conditions that may be risk factors for covid-19 concern, Short form health survey-36, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Ways of Coping Questionnaire (WOC; consisting of 8 subscales: Confrontive Coping, Distancing, Self-Controlling, Seeking Social Support, Accepting Responsibility, Escape-Avoidance, Planful Problem Solving, Positive Reappraisal). 11% healthworkers reports moderate to very-severe depression, 17% moderate to extremely-severe anxiety and 10% for moderate to extremely-severe stress. 67% of medical staff are worried. No statistically significant differences in the scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were found between nurses and physicians, but differences were found on Escape-Avoidance and Positive Reappraisal subscales. Nurses use significantly more avoiding coping style and positive reappraisal than doctors. Seeking social support is more pronounced in those over 40 years old, while those under 40 use more avoidable stress management techniques. Monitoring and ensuring the mental health of coronavirus care staff is crucial for global health.

Evaluate the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 pandemic during the social distancing period and explore the relationship between social media use and psychological stress during COVID-19 outbreak among Najran city population. Research design is descriptive correlational research design. A snowball sampling technique, was used to recruit participants live in Najran city during the COVID-19 pandemic (1508 participant). A statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.05) are observed between Saudi and non-Saudi participants in all social aspects assessed except for time spent on social media. In addition, a high mean of depression, stress, and anxiety subscale scores are observed in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants with statistically significant differences (p=0.000). As well as high DASS-21 total scores in non-Saudi compared to the Saudi participants. Also, there are positive statistically significant correlations (â‰¤0.05) between participants' time spent in social media and their depression, stress, anxiety, and total DASS scores during the COVID-19 outbreak. The findings of the present study indicate that COVID-19 pandemic generates stress, anxiety and depression among Najran population especially, non-Saudi. This poor psychological condition is exaggerated with prolonged social media use.

The purpose of the current study is to investigate psychological resilience and depression in individuals during the period of COVID-19 outbreak in Turkey in relation to different variables. The study also aims to explore the relationship between psychological resilience and depression. The current study was conducted on a total of 518 people over the social media through the Google e-forms. In the study, the &quot;Short Psychological Resilience Scale&quot; and the &quot;Beck Depression Scale&quot; were used to collect data. In the analysis of the collected data, t-test, One Way Anova, Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis-H Test, Pearson Correlation Coefficient were used. In the current study, psychological resilience and depression were investigated in relation to different variables. Psychological resilience was found to be higher male participants, educators,university graduates and groups with not mental health problems. Depression was found to be higher females, university students, high school and lower graduates,with mental health problems. When the relationship between psychological resilience and depression was investigated, it was found that there is a medium and negative correlation between them. Moreover, the cut-off point for the depression score was set to be 17 and the rate of the people having 17 points or higher scores was found to be 16.6%. In light of the findings of the current study, it can be suggested to offer more mental health care services to those having higher levels of depression. Studies can be conducted to improve online psychological support services. A medium and negative correlation was found between psychological resilience and depression in the current study, which shows that more importance should be attached to activities to improve psychological resilience.","KaraÅŸar, Canli","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.273","20200819","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; Turkey; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Attachment Theory and Psychological Responses to the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a significant impact on the psychological health of individuals and societies. A theoretical framework is required in order to understand this impact and strategies to mitigate it. In this paper, individual and community responses to COVID-19 are discussed from the point of view of attachment theory, a psychological theory which examines the formation and disruption of attachment bonds across the life-span from an evolutionary perspective. The contributions of this perspective to individual psychological disorders such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress, as well as to social responses such as interpersonal violence and stigmatization, are discussed in the light of findings from attachment research. Proposals for incorporating the knowledge derived from attachment theory into therapeutic strategies, as well as in developing community resilience in the face of COVID-19, are discussed based on the available evidence.

"COVID-19 Pandemic: A Serious Threat for Public Mental Health Globally","Deep emotion traumas in societies around the globe are overcome by extreme human catastrophes such as natural disasters, social crises, war conflicts and infectious virus induced pandemic diseases, etc., can lead to enormous stress-related disorders. The current ongoing pandemic known as COVID-19 caused by novel Corona virus first appeared in Wuhan, city of China and then rapidly spread in the whole world. It has affected various frontiers of lives and caused numerous psychiatric problems like nervousness, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), fear and uncertainty, panic attacks, depression, obsessive compulsory disorder, xenophobia and racism, etc. Globally COVID-19 has persuaded public mental health crisis. Furthermore, inadequate resources of public mental health services in several countries are discussed in this review, which will be further straighten by the upcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All mental health sciences including Psychiatry can play a very important role in the comfort of COVID-19 infected individuals and their relatives, healthcare providers and society. We need to learn more about psychological and psychiatric features of COVID-19 from the perceptions of public and global mental health in order to cope up the present deteriorating situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Anjum, Ullah, Rana, Khan, Memon, Ahmed, Jabeen, Faryal","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.245","20200819","Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Internationality; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Pandemia: Neuropsychiatric Comorbidity and Consequences","Infection with the new corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) was first registered in December 2019 in China, and then later spread rapidly to the rest of the world. On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) informed the public for the first time about causes of pneumonnia of unknown origin, in the city of Wuhan (Hubei Province, China), in people who were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and wet animal whole sale local market in Wuhan. Coronavrus disease, called COVID-19 (Corona virus disease 2019), after China quickly spread to most countries in the wold, and the WHO on March 11, 2020 declared a pandmic with this virus. SARS-CoV-2, has a high level of sequential similarities to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the same receptors when it enters the human body (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/ACE2). COVID-19 is respiratry infection that is primarily transmitted via respiratry droplets. Typical symptoms of COVID-19 infection can be very moderate (infected can be even asymptomatic) to very severe, with severe respiratory symptoms (bilateral severe pneumonia), septic schock, and fatal outcome. Numeous unknows regarding the biological, epidemilogical adn clinical characteristics of COVID-19, still exist, and make it impossible to predict with certainty the further course of the current pandemic. COVID-19 is primarily a disease of the respiratory system, but SARS-CoV-2, in a number of patients also penetrates the CNS, and apparently could be responsible for fatal outcome in some cases. The entrry of the virus into the brain can lead to neurological and psychiatric manifestationss, which are not uncommon, including headache, paresthesia, myalgia, impaired consciousnessm, confusion or delirum and cerebrovascular diseases. SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals should be evaluated in a timely manner for neurological and psychiatic symptoms because tretament of infection-related neurological and psychiatric complications is an important factor in better prognosis of severe COVID-19 patients.From the current point of view, it seems that in COVID-19 survivors, in the coming years and decades, the inflammatory systemic process and/or the inflammatory process of the brain could trigger long-term mechanisms that generally lead to an increase of neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. Psychosocial consequences as well as consequences for mental health are also significant, both for the general population and especially for health workers of all profiles. COVID-19 pandemia is associtaed with negative psychosocial consequences, including depressive symptoms, anxiety, anger and stress, sleep disorders, simpotms of posttrauamtic stres disorder, social isolation, loneliness and stigmatization.","SinanoviÄ‡, MuftiÄ‡, SinanoviÄ‡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.236","20200819","Animals; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 and Social Isolation: A Case for Why Home-Based Resistance Training Is Needed to Maintain Musculoskeletal and Psychosocial Health for Older Adults","The coronavirus disease outbreak in China has become the world's leading health headline and is causing major panic and public concerns. Public health guidelines in many countries are suggesting that people stay at home to avoid human-to-human transmission of the virus, which may lead to reduced physical activity and greater feelings of isolation. Such effects may be particularly problematic in older adults due to their reduced physical capacities and their potential for increased mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. A potential way to minimize many of these side effects of stay-at-home guidelines may be progressive home-based resistance training. A simple way to provide progressive overload in home-based resistance training may involve elastic resistance, which has been demonstrated to provide similar benefits to traditional resistance training equipment typically found in gymnasiums. Recommendations on how older adults can safely and effectively perform elastic resistance training at home are provided.","Marcos-Pardo, Espeso-GarcÃ­a, LÃ³pez-Vivancos, Abelleira Lamela, Keogh","https://doi.org/10.1123/japa.2020-0131","20200815","coronavirus; elastic resistance training; exercise; older people","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Promotion of Maternal-Infant Mental Health and Trauma-Informed Care During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has led to disruptions in health care in the perinatal period and women's childbirth experiences. Organizations that represent health care professionals have responded with general practice guidelines for pregnant women, but limited attention has been devoted to mental health in the perinatal period during a pandemic. Evidence suggests that in this context, significant psychological distress may have the potential for long-term psychological harm for mothers and infants. For infants, this risk may extend into early childhood. In this commentary, we present recommendations for practice, research, and policy related to mental health in the perinatal period. These recommendations include the use of a trauma-informed framework to promote social support and infant attachment, use of technology and telehealth, and assessment for mental health needs and experiences of violence.","Choi, Records, Low, Alhusen, Kenner, Bloch, Premji, Hannan, Anderson, Yeo, Cynthia Logsdon","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogn.2020.07.004","20200819","COVID-19; mental health; nursing; pandemic; trauma-informed care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"An Observational Study of the Impact of COVID-19 and the Transition to Telehealth on Community Mental Health Center Providers","The COVID-19 pandemic has swiftly and remarkably altered community mental health service delivery and evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation. This study reports provider perspectives on the impact that COVID-19 had on their work and EBP implementation. Providers (<i>n</i> = 93) completed online surveys with quantitative measures and open-ended items targeting their responses and/or reactions to COVID-19, and to the transition to providing services via telehealth. Perceptions of personal risk and rumination around COVID-19 were low, while telehealth was viewed positively by providers. Three major themes emerged regarding the major impacts of COVID-19 on work: 1) the altered nature of interactions between patient/client and provider, 2) changes in provider expectations regarding productivity, and 3) challenges maintaining work-life balance. In regard to the major impacts of COVID-19 on EBP implementation, three themes emerged: 1) increased difficulty delivering certain therapies via telehealth, 2) potential limitations to session confidentiality, and 3) challenge of engaging children in telehealth. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, community mental health providers continued to engage with clients and implement EBPs while navigating a number of changes related to the transition to telehealth. This study highlights the need for further work on what supports providers need to effectively engage with clients and deliver EBPs via telehealth and has implications for how telehealth is sustained or de-implemented in response to COVID-19.","Sklar, Reeder, Carandang, Ehrhart, Aarons","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-48767/v1","20200818","COVID-19; EBP implementation; community mental health; provider perspectives; telehealth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Safety and Efficacy of Chest Physiotherapy in Patients With COVID-19: A Critical Review","The present global pandemic of COVID-19 has brought the whole world to a standstill, causing morbidity, death, and changes in personal roles. The more common causes of morbidity and death in these patients include pneumonia and respiratory failure, which cause the patients to require artificial ventilation and other techniques that can improve respiratory function. One of these techniques is chest physiotherapy, and this has been shown to improve gas exchange, reverse pathological progression, and reduce or avoid the need for artificial ventilation when it is provided very early in other respiratory conditions. For patients with COVID-19, there is limited evidence on its effect, especially in the acute stage and in patients on ventilators. In contrast, in patients after discharge, chest physiotherapy in the form of respiratory muscle training, cough exercise, diaphragmatic training, stretching exercise, and home exercise have resulted in improved FEV1 (L), FVC (L), FEV1/FVC%, diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%), endurance, and quality of life, and a reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms. However, there are still controversies on whether chest physiotherapy can disperse aerosols and accelerate the rate of spread of the infection, especially since COVID-19 is highly contagious. While some authors believe it is possible, others believe the aerosol generated by chest physiotherapy is not within respirable range. Therefore, measures such as the use of surgical masks, tele-rehabilitation, and self-management tools can be used to limit cross-infection.","Abdullahi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00454","20200818","COVID-19; critical care; mortality; physiotherapy; pneumonia; ventilator","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Sleep Disturbance and Psychological Profiles of Medical Staff and Non-Medical Staff During the Early Outbreak of COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has considerably burdened the healthcare system in the Hubei Province, the most severely affected region in China. The aim of our study was to assess the psychological effects of COVID-19 epidemic on the healthcare workers in Hubei. A total of 2737 healthcare workers were sampled using a two-dimensional code shared online between Mar 4 and Mar 9, 2020. The questionnaires consisted of three elements: baseline characteristics, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome variables were PQSI, anxiety and depression scores of non-medical staff, non-frontline medical staff and frontline medical staff. Binary logistical regression analyses were used to compare between respondents with and without sleep disturbance. About 61.6% of the respondents reported sleep problems, 22.6% experienced anxiety, and 35% exhibited depressive symptoms. The prevalence of sleep disorders was higher among the frontline healthcare workers compared to the non-frontline and non-medical staff, while anxiety and depression were prevalent in the entire cohort. Logistic regression analysis identified medical occupation, family burden, bereavement, anxiety, and depression as significantly predictive of poor sleep quality. Frontline medical staff are more vulnerable to sleep disturbances. Psychosocial interventions are needed to help allied healthcare personnel to better respond to COVID-19 and future outbreaks.","Wang, Song, Xia, He, Tang, Hou, Lei","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00733","20200818","Coronavirus Disease 2019; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Mental health; Pittsburgh sleep quality index; frontline medical workers; pandemic; public health emergency","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Association Between Current Physical Activity and Current Perceived Anxiety and Mood in the Initial Phase of COVID-19 Confinement","The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19, and several enacted measures such as compulsory confinement may have collateral consequences on both physical and mental health. We aimed to investigate associations between current physical activity (PA) and current perceived anxiety and mood among a sample of Spanish adults confined due to COVID-19 restrictions of movement. Using an online survey, we collected data on the Spanish adult population regarding health habits during the first days of enacted confinement. A total of 2250 participants (54.8% women) aged 35.3 (SD 13.6) completed the survey, which included questions about sociodemographic characteristics (i.e. age, gender, civil status, education, and occupation), health habits (i.e. prior PA, alcohol consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours) and COVID-19 confinement context (i.e. number of isolation days, solitude, and exposure to COVID-19). Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) short form was used to estimate weekly minutes of PA, whereas a single-item question was used to assess both current perceived anxiety and mood. We conducted weighted binomial logistic regressions to check associations between current adherence to WHO guidelines of PA and current perceived anxiety and mood of confined adults. Significant inverse associations between overall adherence to PA and current perceived anxiety in the final adjusted model (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.54-0.79) as well as in several subgroup analyses such as younger women were observed. In addition, a borderline significant inverse association was found between current PA and current perceived worse mood when fully adjusted (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-1.00); this association was significantly stronger in women than men. The results of the present study indicate that current PA adherence to WHO guidelines in the initial phase of COVID-19 confinement associates with both lower current perceived anxiety and lower current perceived worse mood among a sample of Spanish adults.","LÃ³pez-Bueno, Calatayud, Ezzatvar, CasajÃºs, Smith, Andersen, LÃ³pez-SÃ¡nchez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00729","20200818","COVID-19; Spain; adults; mental health; physical activity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What Happened to Patients With Obsessive Compulsive Disorder During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Multicentre Report From Tertiary Clinics in Northern Italy","After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, this resulted in extraordinary public health measures to control the infection, such as entire countries being placed under quarantine. The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.","Benatti, Albert, Maina, Fiorillo, Celebre, Girone, Fineberg, Bramante, Rigardetto, Dell'Osso","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00720","20200818","COVID-19; Internet-checking; avoidance; obsessive compulsive disorder; suicidal ideation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health Status of Paediatric Medical Workers in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak","A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has occurred in China, and national medical workers have been thrown into this silent battle. Paediatric medical workers have been an important part of this battle and under enormous pressure. This paper evaluates the depression, anxiety, and stress of paediatric medical staff during the epidemic and examines related impact factors. We conducted this study using online questionnaires <i>via</i> social networking software during the week of Feb. 17 to Feb. 23, 2020. The 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS), which is a revised, simplified version of the original DASS developed by Lovibond etÂ al., was used in this study. Among all 2,031 respondents, 14.81%, 18.3%, and 9.98% had depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, respectively. Males, doctors, individuals aged between 31â€‘60 years, those with senior job titles, those who had contact with patients with confirmed or suspected cases of COVID-19, those who worked on the clinical frontlines fighting the epidemic and those who had experience combating similar outbreaks were more likely to have depression, anxiety or stress symptoms. Respondents in Beijing and Chongqing had lower negative psychological symptom scores than the national average. During the COVID-19 outbreak, depression, anxiety and stress are present to varying degrees among paediatric medical workers across the country. Psychological crisis interventions should be implemented to protect the mental health of paediatric medical workers during and after the epidemic.","Liu, Wang, Chen, Zhang, Bao, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00702","20200818","COVID-19; China; mental health status; outbreak; paediatric medical workers","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Evidence for the Effectiveness of Remdesivir (GS-5734), a Nucleoside-Analog Antiviral Drug in the Inhibition of <i>I</i><sub>K(M)</sub> or <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> and in the Stimulation of <i>I</i><sub>MEP</sub>","Remdesivir (RDV, GS-5734), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug in the class of nucleotide analogs, has been particularly tailored for treatment of coronavirus infections. However, to which extent RDV is able to modify various types of membrane ion currents remains largely uncertain. In this study, we hence intended to explore the possible perturbations of RDV on ionic currents endogenous in pituitary GH<sub>3</sub> cells and Jurkat T-lymphocytes. The whole-cell current recordings of ours disclosed that upon membrane depolarization in GH<sub>3</sub> cells the exposure to RDV concentration-dependently depressed the peak or late components of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> elicitation with effective IC<sub>50</sub> values of 10.1 or 2.8 Î¼M, respectively; meanwhile, the value of dissociation constant of RDV-induced blockage of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> on the basis of the first-order reaction was yielded to be 3.04 Î¼M. Upon the existence of RDV, the steady-state inactivation curve of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> was established in the RDV presence; moreover, the recovery became slowed. However, RDV-induced blockage of <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> failed to be overcome by further addition of either Î±,Î²-methylene ATP or cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. The RDV addition also lessened the strength of M-type K<sup>+</sup> current with the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 2.5 Î¼M. The magnitude of voltage hysteresis of <i>I</i><sub>K(M)</sub> elicited by long-lasting triangular ramp pulse was diminished by adding RDV. Membrane electroporation-induced current in response to large hyperpolarization was enhanced, with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 5.8 Î¼M. Likewise, in Jurkat T-lymphocytes, adding RDV declined <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> amplitude concomitantly with the raised rate of current inactivation applied by step depolarization. Therefore, in terms of the RDV molecule, there appears to be an unintended activity of the prodrug on ion channels. Its inhibition of both <i>I</i><sub>K(DR)</sub> and <i>I</i><sub>K(M)</sub> occurring in a non-genomic fashion might provide additional but important mechanisms through which <i>in vivo</i> cellular functions are seriously perturbed.","Chang, Liu, Gao, Lee, Lee, Wu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2020.01091","20200818","M-type K+ current; delayed-rectifier K+ current; electroporation-induced current; lymphocyte; pituitary cell; remdesivir (GS-5734); voltage hysteresis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Especially in times of social isolation and governmental restrictions, mental health should not be neglected. Innovative approaches are required to support psychologically burdened people. The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' has been developed to offer manualised and evidence-based psychotherapeutic support adapted to COVID-19-related issues in order to overcome psychological distress. In our study, we aim to assess the efficacy of the e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' in terms of reducing distress (primary outcome), depression and anxiety symptoms as well as improving self-efficacy, quality of life and mindfulness (secondary outcomes). Furthermore, we want to evaluate the programme's usability, feasibility and participants' satisfaction with 'CoPE It' (tertiary outcome). The e-mental health intervention 'CoPE It' consists of four 30â€‰min modules, conducted every other day, involving psychotherapeutic techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The widely applied and previously established content has been adapted to the context of the COVID-19 pandemic by experts in psychosomatic medicine and stress prevention. In our longitudinal study, adult participants-with adequate German language and computer skills, and who have provided informed consent-will be recruited via emergency support hotlines in Germany.

"Clinical and CT characteristics of healthcare workers with COVID-19: A single-centered, retrospective study","A large number of healthcare workers have been infected with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to investigate their clinical and chest computed tomography (CT) characteristics.The clinical, laboratory test and CT features of 43 medical and hospital staff with confirmed COVID-19 (MP group, 26-70 years old) were retrospectively analyzed, and compared to 43 non-medical related patients (non-MP group, 26-71 years old). Follow-up CT characteristics were analyzed to assess the disease progression in the period of hospitalization.At admission, the main complaints of the MP group, including fever (81.4%), fatigue (48.8%) and cough (41.9%), were similar to the non-MP group. The C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher in the non-MP group than the MP group (17.5â€ŠÂ±â€Š22.4â€Šmg/L, 20.2â€ŠÂ±â€Š23.4â€Šmm/H and 219â€ŠÂ±â€Š66U/L, respectively, Pâ€Š&lt;â€Š.05). Ground-grass opacities, consolidation, interstitial thickening were common CT features of both groups.

"Risk factors for anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic: A web-based cross-sectional survey","The article presents a protocol of a cross-sectional study of mental health of pregnant women in relation to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim is to compare differences in anxiety and depression scores of pregnant women between countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is to assess demographic, economic, and social aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores among pregnant women worldwide in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we will be able to compare differences in perception of the different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic (social distancing, restrictions related to delivery) between countries and according to the epidemic status (number of infected patients, number of reported deaths). The comparisons will also be done according to the COVID-19 status of the participants. It is a web-based anonymous survey of pregnant women living in countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Debate: Promoting capabilities for young people's agency in the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic is having a pervasive effect on young people's mental health and well-being, giving rise to feelings of deep uncertainty and lack of control. Inspired by Amartya Sen's capabilities framework, we argue that building capacity and creating opportunities for community and civic engagement during this time will help young people gain agency and well-being. We highlight two key areas for participatory engagement: coproduction of research, and peer-led interventions. Providing capabilities for young people's agency not only builds personal resilience, but also strengthens the quality of our research, interventions and overall response to the global health crisis.","Pavarini, Lyreskog, Manku, Musesengwa, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12409","20200827","Adolescent; Betacoronavirus; Child; Community Participation; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychology, Adolescent; Psychology, Child; Resilience, Psychological; Uncertainty","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Subjective ratings of emotive stimuli predict the impact of the COVID-19 quarantine on affective states","The COVID-19 crisis resulted in a large proportion of the world's population having to employ social distancing measures and self-quarantine. Given that limiting social interaction impacts mental health, we assessed the effects of quarantine on emotive perception as a proxy of affective states. To this end, we conducted an online experiment whereby 112 participants provided affective ratings for a set of normative images and reported on their well-being during COVID-19 self-isolation. We found that current valence ratings were significantly lower than the original ones from 2015. This negative shift correlated with key aspects of the personal situation during the confinement, including working and living status, and subjective well-being. These findings indicate that quarantine impacts mood negatively, resulting in a negatively biased perception of emotive stimuli. Moreover, our online assessment method shows its validity for large-scale population studies on the impact of COVID-19 related mitigation methods and well-being.","LÃ³pez-Carral, Grechuta, Verschure","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237631","20200828","Adult; Affect; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Machine Learning; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Perceived change in physical activity levels and mental health during COVID-19: Findings among adult twin pairs","Physical distancing and other COVID-19 pandemic mitigation strategies may have unintended consequences on a number of health behaviors and health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between perceived change in physical activity or exercise and mental health outcomes over the short-term in response to COVID-19 mitigation strategies in a sample of adult twins. This was a cross-sectional study of 3,971 identical and same-sex fraternal adult twins (909 pairs, 77% identical) from the community-based Washington State Twin Registry. Participants in this study completed an online survey examining the impact of COVID-19 mitigation on a number of health-related behaviors and outcomes, administered between March 26 and April 5, 2020. In the present study, the exposure was perceived change in physical activity or exercise. The outcomes were levels of perceived anxiety and stress. More twin pairs reported a decrease in physical activity levels (42%) than those reporting no change (31%) or increased physical activity levels (27%). A perceived decrease in physical activity or exercise was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. However, the physical activity-stress relationship was confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors. On the other hand, the physical activity-anxiety relationship held after controlling for genetic and shared environmental factors, although it was no longer significant after further controlling for age and sex, with older twins more likely to report lower levels of anxiety and females more likely to report higher levels of anxiety. Strategies to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic may be impacting physical activity and mental health, with those experiencing a decrease in physical activity also having higher levels of stress and anxiety. These relationships are confounded by genetic and shared environmental factors, in the case of stress, and age and sex, in the case of anxiety.","Duncan, Avery, Seto, Tsang","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237695","20200828","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Twins; Washington","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, June 24-30, 2020","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with mental health challenges related to the morbidity and mortality caused by the disease and to mitigation activities, including the impact of physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.* Symptoms of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder increased considerably in the United States during April-June of 2020, compared with the same period in 2019 (1,2). To assess mental health, substance use, and suicidal ideation during the pandemic, representative panel surveys were conducted among adults aged â‰¥18 years across the United States during June 24-30, 2020.

We aimed to investigate the association between pandemic-related stress factors (PRSF) and anxiety and to evaluate the potential effect of resilience on anxiety among physicians. A self-report digital survey was completed by 1106 Israeli physicians (564 males and 542 females) during the COVID-19 outbreak. Anxiety was measured by the 8-item version of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Resilience was evaluated by the 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Stress was assessed using a PRSF inventory. Physicians reported high levels of anxiety with a mean score of 59.20â€‰Â±â€‰7.95. We found an inverse association between resilience and anxiety. Four salient PRSF (mental exhaustion, anxiety about being infected, anxiety infecting family members, and sleep difficulties) positively associated with anxiety scores. Our study identified specific PRSF including workload burden and fear of infection that are associated with increased anxiety and resilience that is associated with reduced anxiety among physicians.","Mosheva, Hertz-Palmor, Dorman Ilan, Matalon, Pessach, Afek, Ziv, Kreiss, Gross, Gothelf","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23085","20200821","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; resilience; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Excessive media consumption about COVID-19 is associated with increased state anxiety: Outcomes of a large online survey in Russia","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has potentially had a negative impact on the mental health and well being of individuals and families. Anxiety levels and risk factors within particular populations are poorly described. To evaluate confidence, understanding, trust and concerns and levels of anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in general population and assess risk factors for increased anxiety. We launched a cross-sectional online survey a large Russian population between 6th and 15th April 2020 using multiple social media platforms. A set of questions targeted confidence, understanding, trust and concerns in respondents. State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was used to measure anxiety. Multiple linear regressions were used to model predictors of COVID-19 related anxiety. The survey was completed by 23,756 out of 53,966 unique visitors (44.0% response rate); 21,364 of who were residing in 62 areas of Russia. State anxiety (S-Anxiety) scores were higher than Trait anxiety (T-Anxiety) across all regions of Russia (median S-Anxiety score 52 [IQR 44-60]), exceeding published norms. Time spent following news on COVID-19 was strongly associated with an increased S-Anxiety adjusted for baseline anxiety level. One to two hours spent reading COVID news was associated with 5.46 (95%CI 5.03-5.90) point difference, 2-3 hours 7.06 (6.37-7.74) and more than three hours 8.65 (7.82-9.47), respectively; all compared to less than 30 minutes per day. Job loss during pandemic was another important factor associated with higher S-Anxiety scores (3.95 [3.31 - 4.58]). Despite survey respondents reporting high confidence in information regarding COVID-19, as well as understanding of healthcare guidance, they reported low overall trust in state and local authorities and perception of country readiness. Among Russian respondents from multiple social media platforms, there is evidence of higher levels of state-anxiety associated with recent job loss and increased news consumption, as well as lower than expected trust in government agencies. These findings can help inform development of key public-health messages to help reduce anxiety and raise perceived trust in governmental response to this current national emergency. Using similar methodology, comparative surveys are ongoing in other national populations.","Nekliudov, Blyuss, Cheung, Petrou, Genuneit, Sushentsev, Levadnaya, Comberiati, Warner, Tudor-Williams, Teufel, Greenhawt, Dunn Galvin, Munblit","https://doi.org/10.2196/20955","20200813",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 01/30/2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 03/11/2020. The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on 04/02/2020; two million mark on 04/15/2020; three million mark on 04/27/2020 and the four million mark on 05/09/2020.

"Immediate and delayed psychological effects of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected public health and wellbeing. In response to the pandemic threat of the coronavirus epidemic, several countries, including China, adopted lockdown and quarantine policies, which may cause psychological distress. This study aimed to explore the psychological impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine during the COVID-19 outbreak in China as well as the corresponding risk factors and protective factors. We examined the immediate (2-week) and delayed (2-month) impact of province-wide lockdown and personal quarantine on psychological distress in a national sample of 1390 Chinese residents. No immediate impact of province-wide lockdown on psychological distress was observed, whereas personal quarantine increased individuals' anxiety, fear, and anger. Despite the lack of initial association, psychological distress increased among those in province-wide lockdown. Self-stigma and personal control both significantly moderated the association between lockdown and psychological distress, but in different directions. Those with higher self-stigma and lower personal control were more impacted by the lockdown. Government support moderated the impact of quarantine on psychological distress, but not that of lockdown. The delayed effects of lockdown and quarantine on psychological distress were observed, and self-stigma, social support, and perceived control moderate the relationships. This study is the first to demonstrate the psychological costs of province-wide lockdowns on individuals' mental health, providing evidence of the need for mitigation strategies and timely public mental health preparedness in countries with recent outbreaks of COVID-19.","Gan, Ma, Wu, Chen, Zhu, Hall","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003116","20200828","COVID-19 outbreak; personal quarantine; province-wide lockdown; psychological distress; self-stigma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Development of health care workers' mental health during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Switzerland: two cross-sectional studies","Virus outbreaks such as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are challenging for health care workers (HCWs), affecting their workload and their mental health. Since both, workload and HCW's well-being are related to the quality of care, continuous monitoring of working hours and indicators of mental health in HCWs is of relevance during the current pandemic. The existing investigations, however, have been limited to a single study period. We examined changes in working hours and mental health in Swiss HCWs at the height of the pandemic (T1) and again after its flattening (T2). We conducted two cross-sectional online studies among Swiss HCWs assessing working hours, depression, anxiety, and burnout. From each study, 812 demographics-matched participants were included into the analysis. Working hours and mental health were compared between the two samples. Compared to prior to the pandemic, the share of participants working less hours was the same in both samples, whereas the share of those working more hours was lower in the T2 sample. The level of depression did not differ between the samples. In the T2 sample, participants reported more anxiety, however, this difference was below the minimal clinically important difference. Levels of burnout were slightly higher in the T2 sample. Two weeks after the health care system started to transition back to normal operations, HCWs' working hours still differed from their regular hours in non-pandemic times. Overall anxiety and depression among HCWs did not change substantially over the course of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Spiller, MÃ©an, Ernst, Sazpinar, Gehrke, Paolercio, Petry, Pfaltz, Morina, Aebischer, Gachoud, von KÃ¤nel, Weilenmann","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720003128","20200828","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Switzerland; health care workers; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological impact on an orthopaedic outpatient setting in the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, after the coronavirus claimed 4628 lives worldwide. Mental health challenges such as making impossible decisions and working under extreme pressures are expected to be faced by frontline healthcare workers who are directly involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. However, we question if significant stress levels might also be observed in a subspecialty musculoskeletal outpatient department, where staff are not first-line care providers of COVID-19 patients. We hypothesize that these healthcare workers also face significant psychological strain, and we aim to objectively determine the prevalence using a validated caregiver strain index. A cross-sectional study was conducted in outpatient musculoskeletal clinics in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. We collected basic demographic data and used a 13-question tool adapted from the validated Caregiver Strain Index (CSI) to measure psychological strain in these healthcare workers. Participants were divided into 2 groups depending on the level of strain experienced. A total of 62 healthcare workers volunteered for this study. There were 32 participants (51.6%) who had 7 or more positive responses (group 1) and the remaining 30 participants (48.4%) were allocated to group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of demographic data. &quot;Work adjustments&quot; (74.2%), &quot;changes in personal plans&quot; (72.6%), and finding it &quot;confining&quot; (72.6%) garnered the most positive responses in the questionnaire. On the other hand, &quot;financial concerns&quot; garnered the least positive responses (21.0%). The protracted duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its resultant prolonged adjustments can have unintended consequences of wearing down healthcare resources otherwise allocated to chronic and elective conditions. Countries should ensure that measures are put in place to safeguard the mental well-being of our healthcare workers to avoid needing another reactive strategy in this battle against COVID-19.","Wong, Han, Tay, Koh, Howe","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13018-020-01862-9","20200826","COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Psychological; Stress; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Orthopedics; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Singapore; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China","Medical care workers experienced unprecedented levels of workload and pressure since the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Little is known about its exact impact on medical care workers and related factors in China. This study aims to identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical care workers in China. From February 23 to March 5, 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 863 medical care workers from seven provinces in China using standard questionnaires measuring adverse psychological outcomes including Impact of Event Scale-6 (IES-6), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale(DASS)and related psychosocial factors like perceived threat, social support and coping strategies. Exploratory Factor analysis was performed to identify the dimensions of perceived threat by study participants. Multivariate regression was used to examine the determinants of adverse psychological outcomes. Posttraumatic stress (PTS) were prevalent in this sample of health care professionals, and 40.2% indicated positive screens for significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. The proportion of having mild to extremely severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were 13.6, 13.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Perceived threat and passive coping strategies were positively correlated to PTS and DASS scores, while perceived social support and active coping strategies were negatively correlated to DASS scores. Nurses were more likely to be anxious than others among medical care workers during the COVID-19 epidemic. Adverse psychological symptoms were prevalent among medical care workers in China during the COVID-19 epidemic.

"Psychological impact of an epidemic/pandemic on the mental health of healthcare professionals: a rapid review","Epidemics or pandemics, such as the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis, pose unique challenges to healthcare professionals (HCPs). Caring for patients during an epidemic/pandemic may impact negatively on the mental health of HCPs. There is a lack of evidence-based advice on what would be effective in mitigating this impact. This rapid review synthesizes the evidence on the psychological impact of pandemics/epidemics on the mental health of HCPs, what factors predict this impact, and the evidence of prevention/intervention strategies to reduce this impact. According to rapid review guidelines, systematic searches were carried out in Embase.com , PubMed, APA PsycINFO-Ovid SP, and Web of Science (core collection). Searches were restricted to the years 2003 or later to ensure inclusion of the most recent epidemic/pandemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Papers written in French or English, published in peer-reviewed journals, and of quantitative design using validated measures of mental health outcomes were included. Of 1308 papers found, 50 were included. The full protocol for this rapid review was registered with Prospero (reg.no. CRD42020175985). Results show that exposed HCPs working with patients during an epidemic/pandemic are at heightened risk of mental health problems in the short and longer term, particularly: psychological distress, insomnia, alcohol/drug misuse, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, burnout, anger, and higher perceived stress. These mental health problems are predicted by organizational, social, personal, and psychological factors and may interfere with the quality of patient care. Few evidence-based early interventions exist so far. HCPs need to be provided with psychosocial support to protect their mental wellbeing if they are to continue to provide high quality patient care.

"Recommendations for a national Coronavirus disease 2019 response guideline for the care of older persons in Nigeria during and post-pandemic: A family physician's perspective","The older persons in our society are a special group of people in need of additional measures of care and protection. They have medical, financial, emotional and social needs. The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) only exacerbates those needs. COVID-19 is a new disease, and there is limited information regarding the disease. Based on currently available information, older persons and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions may be at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19. Family physicians provide care for individuals across their lifespan. Because geriatricians are internists or family physicians with post-residency training in geriatric medicine, they are major stakeholders in geriatric care. The authors are concerned about the absence of a COVID-19 response guideline/special advisory targeting the vulnerable population of older adults. The management and response to COVID-19 will be implemented in part based on the local context of available resources. Nigeria has been described as a resource-constrained nation. Infection prevention in older persons in Nigeria will far outweigh the possibilities of treatment given limited resources.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on frontline nurses: A cross-sectional survey study","This study aimed to portray the prevalence and associated factors of psychological distress among frontline nurses during COVID-19 outbreak. The COVID-19 outbreak has posed great threat to public health worldwide. Nurses fighting against the epidemic on the frontline might be under great physical and psychological distress. This psychological distress was predominantly described as sleep disturbance, symptoms of anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress, inability to make decisions and even somatic symptoms. Cross-sectional study. Frontline nurses from designated hospitals for COVID-19 patients were invited to complete an online survey by convenience sampling, and the survey included six main sections: the General Health Questionnaire, the Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, socio-demographic, occupation and work history. Multiple logistic analysis was used to identify the potential risk factors of psychological distress. The study methods were compliant with the STROBE checklist. Of the 263 frontline nurses, 66 (25.1%) were identified as psychological distress. Multiple logistic analysis revealed that working in emergency department, concern for family, being treated differently, negative coping style and COVID-19-related stress symptom were positive related to psychological distress. Perceived more social support and effective precautionary measures were negatively associated with psychological distress. The study demonstrated that COVID-19 had a significant psychological impact on frontline nurses. Early detection of psychological distress and supportive intervention should be taken according to the associated factors to prevent more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses. This study highlighted that the frontline nurses were suffering from varying degrees of psychological distress, which needed early screening and supportive intervention for preventing more serious psychological impact on frontline nurses. Beside, more specific measurement should be combined with the GHQ-12 to assess the varying degrees of psychological distress in frontline nurses.","Nie, Su, Zhang, Guan, Li","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15454","20200826","COVID-19; coping style; coronavirus; nurse; psychological distress; social support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Risk factors for anxiety of otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province fighting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","To ensure the mental health of the otolaryngology healthcare workers in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), it is important to know their mental status and to identify possible risk factors. In this study, we investigated the risk factors for the anxiety in the otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province under the COVID-19 epidemic. The otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei Province were surveyed using an online questionnaire in which anxiety was measured against the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the risk factors of anxiety. A total of 449 otolaryngology healthcare workers participated in the study. Of all the participants, 131 (29.18%) had anxiety symptoms. Compared with doctors, nurses were at a higher risk for anxiety (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.162, 95% CI 1.311-3.566). Participants who often suspected self-infection (ORâ€‰=â€‰4.239, 95% CI 1.647-10.909) or family member infection by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (ORâ€‰=â€‰4.485, 95% CI 1.511-13.313) were more likely to develop anxiety than those who never. The subjects who had colleagues diagnosed with COVID-19 were more vulnerable to anxiety (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.014, 95% CI 1.205-3.366). Respondents working in infectious isolation wards had a 3.522-fold increased risk of anxiety compared to those on leave (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.522, 95% CI 1.634-7.593). Some otolaryngology healthcare workers in Hubei province experienced anxiety during the epidemic, but most of them did not receive treatment. The healthcare providers themselves should be informed about and aware of their own mental health, and should be given support as appropriate.

"The Characterization of <i>chIFITMs</i> in Avian Coronavirus Infection In Vivo, Ex Vivo and In Vitro","The coronaviruses are a large family of enveloped RNA viruses that commonly cause gastrointestinal or respiratory illnesses in the infected host. Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a highly contagious respiratory pathogen of chickens that can affect the kidneys and reproductive systems resulting in bird mortality and decreased reproductivity. The interferon-inducible transmembrane (IFITM) proteins are activated in response to viral infections and represent a class of cellular restriction factors that restrict the replication of many viral pathogens. Here, we characterize the relative mRNA expression of the chicken <i>IFITM</i> genes in response to IBV infection, in vivo, ex vivo and in vitro using the pathogenic M41-CK strain, the nephropathogenic QX strain and the nonpathogenic Beaudette strain. In vivo we demonstrate a significant upregulation of <i>chIFITM1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i> and <i>5</i> in M41-CK- and QX-infected trachea two days post-infection. In vitro infection with Beaudette, M41-CK and QX results in a significant upregulation of <i>chIFITM1</i>, <i>2</i> and <i>3</i> at 24 h post-infection.

"Factors affecting the anxiety levels of adolescents in home-quarantine during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","The long-term closing of schools and home-quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic cause negative effects on the physical and mental health of young people. Studies evaluating the mental health of adolescents during the pandemic are limited in the literature. In our study, it was aimed to determine the results of home-quarantine measures taken for adolescents during the pandemic and the affecting factors. This study was conducted as an online cross-sectional self-report questionnaire and included children aged between 12 and 18â€‰years. The data were obtained from the children of volunteer families via Facebook family groups, and Google Forms questionnaires sent by the child psychiatry clinic to their smartphones. Sociodemographic form, State-Trait anxiety scale, and UCLA loneliness survey were used as data collection tools. We examined the data of 745 adolescents. The average age of the study group was 16.83â€‰Â±â€‰1.66â€‰years, and 69.5% were females. It was determined that 88.2% of the adolescents followed the developments in the COVID-19 process and obtained most information from the television.

The consequences of the pandemic unfold daily and they extend beyond physical health. Current research suggests that it is a public mental health crisis. With regards to the physical effects of COVID-19, policy makers have drawn from past experiences, such as the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, to craft unique responses. A similar approach must be taken to address the mental health effects of the pandemic. Because COVID-19 can fit the definitions of a mental health disaster, it can be addressed using the principles of disaster mental health management.

Furthermore, it is challenging to enforce public health regulations and protocols to prevent the spread of infection during a pandemic. This paper was set out to explore the impact of lockdown during COVID-19 among people living in informal settlements. An exploratory qualitative design was utilised. Purposive sampling was used to select research participants. In-depth one-to-one interviews were held involving 30 research participants through a WhatsApp online telephone platform. A thematic approach underpinned by the four stages of data analysis in interpretive phenomenological analysis was utilised to analyse the data. The study found that during the the research participants were affected by lack of space to practice social distancing, over-burdened infrastructure, lack of savings, loss of income and shortage of food, hunger and diseases, anxiety and depression and poor access to education. There is a need to prioritise the needs of informal settlers and endeavour to establish permanent homes.

"Droplet and Aerosol Generation With Endonasal Surgery: Methods to Mitigate Risk During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To define the aerosol and droplet risks associated with endonasal drilling and to identify mitigation strategies. Simulation series with fluorescent 3-dimensional (3D) printed sinonasal models and deidentified cadaveric heads. Dedicated surgical laboratory. Cadaveric specimens irrigated with fluorescent tracer and fluorescent 3D-printed models were drilled. A cascade impactor was used to collect aerosols and small droplets of various aerodynamic diameters under 15 Âµm. Large droplet generation was measured by evaluating the field for fluorescent debris. Aerosol plumes through the nares were generated via nebulizer, and mitigation measures, including suction and SPIWay devices, nasal sheaths, were evaluated regarding reduction of aerosol escape from the nose. The drilling of cadaveric specimens without flexible suction generated aerosols â‰¤3.30 Âµm, and drilling of 3D sinonasal models consistently produced aerosols â‰¤14.1 Âµm. Mitigation with SPIWay or diameter-restricted SPIWay produced same results. There was minimal field contamination in the cadaveric models, 0% to 2.77% field tarp area, regardless of drill burr type or drilling location; cutting burr drilling without suction in the 3D model yielded the worst contamination field (36.1%), followed by coarse diamond drilling without suction (19.4%). The simple placement of a flexible suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx led to complete elimination of all aerosols â‰¤14.1 Âµm, as evaluated by a cascade impactor positioned immediately at the nares. Given the findings regarding aerosol risk reduction, we strongly recommend that physicians use a suction instrument in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx during endonasal surgery in the COVID-19 era.","Dharmarajan, Freiser, Sim, Boorgu, Corcoran, Wang, Gardner, Snyderman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820949802","20200814","COVID-19; aerosol; droplet; endonasal; prevention; safety; skull base","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19: Concerns and behaviours in Croatia","The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty that has heightened fear and worry worldwide, thus elevating the potential for a growth in anxiety. This study aims to examine changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. These changes were examined with respect to gender and family circumstances. The repeated cross-sectional data were conducted over two time points over the 3 weeks (N<sub>1</sub> = 888; N<sub>2</sub> = 966). Participants completed online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention. Findings demonstrate dramatic increase in concern and safety behaviours among participants during the 3 weeks between the first identified case and the first fatality. The results suggest that parents, and mothers especially, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. People with chronic health conditions also expressed greater concern and safety behaviour than healthy participants, but with small effect size. These findings highlight the importance of developing clear guidelines for alleviating the negative effects on mental health through effective communication strategies that minimize fear and emphasize positive behavioural change. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? In times of pandemic, people react with elevated levels of anxiety and some will adjust their behaviours in order to protect themselves as well as their family and friends. Some of the measures introduced to protect the spread of the COVID-19 disease have induced an atmosphere of fear, which in turn can lead to an increase in maladaptive anxiety and a greater burden on mental health. What does this study add? By conducting the research in two waves representing two critical time points in the developing COVID-19 situation in Croatia, we were able to trace a large increase in anxiety levels and safety behaviours among the general population. There is a discordance between those who are at most risk from serious consequences of the disease and those who are at greatest risk for maladaptive anxiety. Parents, and mothers in particular, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. Lockdown measures have allowed us to ensure the safety of those vulnerable for serious COVID-19 illness. Now, we must focus on preserving the mental health of our whole community.","Lauri Korajlija, Jokic-Begic","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12425","20200814","COVIDâ€19; concerns; gender; parental status; safety behaviour","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

However, the majority of studies only accounted for frontline healthcare workers with direct patient exposure. This study aims to look at the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a specific, vulnerable and yet hidden group of healthcare workers, namely laboratory healthcare workers who are at high risk exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus from handling infected patients' blood samples, in addition to a marked increase in workload. A multicentre study was conducted in Singapore via online questionnaire looking at psychological and physical impact of COVID-19 on laboratory healthcare workers. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Numeric rating scale on fear (NRS) were validated scores used in this study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software version 23 (IBM Corp). A total of 122 staffs participated and more than half of the cohort experienced mild to severe fear, anxiety and depression. Increase in depression score was also found to be associated with increased physical exhaustion (OR = 6.1, 95% CI 1.4-29.1, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.02), loss of appetite (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.0, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.02), poor sleep quality (OR = 7.5, 95% CI 2.9-19.4, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.005), and the use of sedative (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.1-13.5, <i>p</i>â€‰=â€‰.03).

Between April 21-May 21, 2020, 93 older adults in the United States who had completed measures characterizing their personal social networks, subjective loneliness, and depression six to nine months prior to the pandemic completed the same measures via phone interview, as well as questions about the impact of the pandemic on their social relationships. Older adults reported higher depression and greater loneliness following the onset of the pandemic. Loneliness positively predicted depression. Perceived relationship strength, but not social engagement, moderated this relationship such that loneliness only predicted depression for individuals who became closer to their networks during the pandemic. For those who felt less close, depression was higher irrespective of loneliness. The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted older adults' mental health and social well-being in the short-term. Potential long-term impacts are considered.","Krendl, Perry","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa110","20200901","COVID-19; aging; depression; loneliness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The major product of ACE2 is Ang1-7, known as a vasodilator peptide and part of the depressant arm of the RAS. There are two form of ACE2. Coronavirus cover with some proteins in order to help viral attachment to the cell membrane ACE2 as a receptor and then fuse and enter the cells. ACE2 was expressed in oral Cavity, salivary glands of the mouth, esophagus, myocardial cells, kidney, and enterocytes, along all the respiratory tract, intestine, and blood vessels. In this article, we explain the renin-angiotensin system and its components. Also, we shortly explain the organs involved in COVID-19 disease and we will talk about the possible causes of damage to these organs. We also reviewed the probable mechanism of using ACE2 in viral attachment and the probable treatment processes will also be discussed based on the surface proteins of the virus and ACE2. In addition, we briefly discuss the anti-angiotensin drugs and why patients with chronic disease are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and show worse progression.","Kenarkoohi, Maleki, Safari, Kafashian, Saljoughi, Sohrabipour","https://doi.org/10.2174/1573402116666200810134702","20200811","COVID-19; Renin-angiotensin system; SARS-CoV-2; angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors; angiotensin converting enzyme 2; coronavirus","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.","Lebel, MacKinnon, Bagshawe, Tomfohr-Madsen, Giesbrecht","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Physical Activity; Pregnancy; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16Â h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive traces and somatizations was higher in situations involving front-line professionals.","da Silva, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057","20200824","COVID-19; Health professionals; Mental health; Psychiatric repercussions","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Time and Covid-19 stress in the lockdown situation: Time free, Â«DyingÂ» of boredom and sadness","A lockdown of people has been used as an efficient public health measure to fight against the exponential spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and allows the health system to manage the number of patients. The aim of this study (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00430818) was to evaluate the impact of both perceived stress aroused by Covid-19 and of emotions triggered by the lockdown situation on the individual experience of time. A large sample of the French population responded to a survey on their experience of the passage of time during the lockdown compared to before the lockdown. The perceived stress resulting from Covid-19 and stress at work and home were also assessed, as were the emotions felt. The results showed that people have experienced a slowing down of time during the lockdown. This time experience was not explained by the levels of perceived stress or anxiety, although these were considerable, but rather by the increase in boredom and sadness felt in the lockdown situation. The increased anger and fear of death only explained a small part of variance in the time judgment. The conscious experience of time therefore reflected the psychological difficulties experienced during lockdown and was not related to their perceived level of stress or anxiety.","Droit-Volet, Gil, Martinelli, Andant, Clinchamps, Parreira, Rouffiac, Dambrun, Huguet, Dubuis, Pereira, Bouillon, Dutheil","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236465","20200828","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Boredom; Coronavirus Infections; Fear; Female; France; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Sadness; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Impact of COVID-19 on the Mental Health of Healthcare Professionals in Pakistan","Introduction As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, health care professionals (HDPs) are facing immense strain due to the heavy load of cases. In many cases, they work increasingly long hours, often with limited resources and a dubious infrastructure. Thus, it is important to check on the mental health of caregivers. Methods and materials This cross-sectional study was conducted in May 2020, at various hospitals in Karachi, Pakistan. All HCPs posted in theÂ COVID-19 isolation wards were invited to participate and aÂ total of 112Â completed this study. A carefully structured formÂ was created, which included the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results The overall mean score of anxiety was 19.01 Â±Â 9.2, depression was 18.12 Â± 10, and stress was 20.12 Â± 12.0. There were 81 (72.3%) participants who suffered from moderate to extremely severe depression, 96 ( 85.7%) participants who suffered from moderate to extremely severe anxiety, and 101 (90.1%) participants who reported moderate to extreme stress levels Conclusions It is evident that there are a high number of healthcare workers affected by various psychological ailments such as anxiety, stress, and depression. It is important that the government take steps to ensure that HCPs' mental health is regularly checked and that efforts are made to reduce their burdens.","Sandesh, Shahid, Dev, Mandhan, Shankar, Shaikh, Rizwan","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8974","20200810","covid 19; mental health; pakistan","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on general population in West Bengal: A cross-sectional study","COVID-19 pandemic poses a unique medical challenge to the humanity in recent times. The psychological impact of the pandemic itself and the lockdown in particular is likely to be huge. To assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on general population in West Bengal. It was an online survey which was conducted using Google Forms with link sent using WhatsApp. A 38-item self-designed questionnaire was used for the study. The survey questionnaire would take around 5-7 min to complete. Total 507 responses were received by the stipulated time. Near about five-seventh (71.8%) and one-fifth (24.7%) of the respondents felt more worried and depressed, respectively, in the past 2 weeks. Half of the respondents (52.1%) were preoccupied with the idea of contracting COVID-19 and one-fifth (21.1%) of the respondents were repeatedly thinking of getting themselves tested for the presence of COVID-19 despite having no symptoms. Majority (69.6%) of the respondents were worried about the financial loss they were incurring during the period of lockdown. One-fourth (25.6%) and one-third (30.8%) of the respondents found that COVID-19 pandemic had threatened their existence and they found it difficult to adjust to the new routine during 21-day lockdown period, respectively. The index survey suggested that worry and sleep disturbances were common among the respondents in the past 2 weeks.

"Attitude, practice, behavior, and mental health impact of COVID-19 on doctors","COVID-19, like every other pandemic, has imposed an unprecedented threat to doctors' physical and mental health. Literature in this area is sparse. The present study has been done to explore the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of doctors regarding this pandemic and how it influences their depression, anxiety, and stress level. This online survey has been done for 10 days. Data were collected on background characteristics, knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the respondents in a semi-structured pro forma, and psychiatric morbidity was measured by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-21. A total of 152 complete responses have been received. The data were assessed using SPSS software. Out of 152 study participants, 34.9% were depressed and 39.5% and 32.9% were having anxiety and stress, respectively. Significant predictors for psychiatric morbidities were experience in health sector, duty hours, use of protective measures, and altruistic coping. Multivariable logistic regression showed most of the factors to be significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress level. Doctors who were working during COVID pandemic have a high prevalence of psychiatric morbidity. Age and having multiple comorbidities are significant predictive factors. Adequate protective measures should be warranted. Altruistic coping and a sense of greater goal are significant among the doctor community, in this pressing time. The doctors are pushing themselves to the best of their capacity and also protecting their patients' best interest. A large-scale, multicentric study will probably give a larger picture and will guide us for better service planning and delivery.","Chatterjee, Bhattacharyya, Bhattacharyya, Gupta, Das, Banerjee","https://doi.org/10.4103/psychiatry.IndianJPsychiatry_333_20","20200810","Attitude and practice; COVID-19; comorbidities; online survey; stress and depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Postcritical illness vulnerability","Critical illness survivorship is associated with new and worsening physical, cognitive, and emotional status. Survivors are vulnerable to further health set-backs, most commonly because of infection and exacerbation of chronic medical conditions. Awareness of survivors' challenges are important given the anticipated rise in critical illness survivors because of SARS-CoV-2 viral sepsis. Studies continue to document challenges of critical illness survivorship. Beyond the cognitive, physical, and mental health sequelae encompassed by postintensive case syndrome, patients commonly experience persistent immunosuppression, re-hospitalization, inability to resume prior employment, and reduced quality of life. Although recommended practices for enhancing recovery from sepsis are associated with better outcomes, only a minority of patients receive all recommended practices. ICU follow-up programs or peer support groups remain important interventions to learn about and address the multifaceted challenges of critical illness survivorship, but there is little evidence of benefit to date. Survivors of sepsis and critical illness commonly experience impaired health status, reduced quality of life, and inability to return to prior employment. Although the challenges of critical illness survivorship are increasingly well documented, there are relatively few studies on enhancing recovery. Future studies must focus on identifying best practices for optimizing recovery and strategies to promote their implementation.","Prescott, Sussman, Wiersinga","https://doi.org/10.1097/MCC.0000000000000761","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Factors related to preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness","Because of the spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors become important for individuals, especially those who are vulnerable. The present study proposes a model to explain the preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness in Taiwan. A cross-sectional design was carried out and 414 patients with mental illness (230 males [55.6%]; mean ageÂ =Â 46.32 [SDÂ =Â 10.86]) agreed to participate in the study. All the participants completed the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale, Self-Stigma Scale-Short, Believing COVID-19 Information Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Regression models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to examine the factors associated with preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Both regression models and SEM showed that trust in COVID-19 information sources (standardized coefficient [Î²]Â =Â 0.211 in regression; Î²Â =Â 0.194 in SEM) and fear of COVID-19 (Î²Â =Â -0.128 in regression; Î²Â =Â -0.223 in SEM) significantly explained preventive behaviors among individuals with mental illness. The SEM further showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly explained by trust in COVID-19 information sources (Î²Â =Â 0.220) and self-stigma (Î²Â =Â 0.454). Based on the results, healthcare providers should help individuals with mental illness reduce self-stigma and fear of COVID-19 which would consequently improve their preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Moreover, improving trust in COVID-19 information sources for individuals with mental illness may be another method to improve their preventive behaviors.","Chang, Strong, Pakpour, Griffiths, Lin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.07.032","20200814","COVID-19; Fear; Preventive behavior; Psychological distress; Self-stigma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anaesthesia trainees and their training","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] has dislocated clinical services and postgraduate training. To better understand and to document these impacts, we contacted anaesthesia trainees and trainers across six continents and collated their experiences during the pandemic. All aspects of training programmes have been affected. Trainees report that reduced caseload, sub-specialty experience, and supervised procedures are impairing learning. Cancelled educational activities, postponed examinations, and altered rotations threaten progression through training. Job prospects and international opportunities are downgraded. Work-related anxieties about provision of personal protective equipment, and risks to self and to colleagues are superimposed on concerns for family and friends and domestic disruption. These seismic changes have had consequences for well-being and mental health. In response, anaesthetists have developed innovations in teaching and trainee support. New technologies support trainer-trainee interactions, with a focus on e-learning. National training bodies and medical regulators that specify training and oversee assessment of trainees and their progression have provided flexibility in their requirements. Within anaesthesia departments, support transcends grades and job titles with lessons for the future. Attention to wellness, awareness of mental health issues and multimodal support can attenuate but not eliminate trainee distress.","Sneyd, Mathoulin, O'Sullivan, So, Roberts, Paul, Cortinez, Ampofo, Miller, Balkisson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bja.2020.07.011","20200814","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anaesthesia; medical education; mental health; postgraduate medical education; training; well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Exploring Readiness for Teleprecepting in Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner Training","Telehealth offers a solution to many challenges in health care, including the shortage of psychiatric providers. Recently the need to limit patient and provider exposure to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has escalated implementation of telehealth across the globe. As telehealth utilization expands, its role in nursing education and training requires systematic evaluation. Since publication of the National Organization of Nurse Practitioner Faculty white paper supporting telehealth in health care delivery and nurse practitioner education, several studies have demonstrated successful didactic instruction and training in telehealth. However, a recent literature review found no studies evaluating the use of telehealth technology as a means of precepting in clinical training. This small-scale qualitative study investigates the readiness of one behavioral health clinic to provide teleprecepting to psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner students. Two preceptors and one student were interviewed using a peer-reviewed semistructured interview guide using video chat. Responses were reviewed, coded, and categorized into themes. Thematic analysis of the interviews revealed three categories for consideration in establishing teleprecepting. Clinical factors, logistics, and comparison with traditional precepting are discussed. Interviewees viewed teleprecepting as a viable method of increasing access to clinical training. This project supports teleprecepting as a feasible strategy for improving access to clinical training and as a technological resource that merits systematic evaluation. Practice guidelines are needed for teleprecepting of advanced practice registered nurse students, and both preceptors and students may benefit from training to support best practices prior to implementation.","Johnson, Ling, Melino","https://doi.org/10.1177/1078390320948127","20200810","community mental health services; graduate nursing education program planning and development; telemental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health and clinical psychological science in the time of COVID-19: Challenges, opportunities, and a call to action","COVID-19 presents significant social, economic, and medical challenges. Because COVID-19 has already begun to precipitate huge increases in mental health problems, clinical psychological science must assert a leadership role in guiding a national response to this secondary crisis. In this article, COVID-19 is conceptualized as a unique, compounding, multidimensional stressor that will create a vast need for intervention and necessitate new paradigms for mental health service delivery and training. Urgent challenge areas across developmental periods are discussed, followed by a review of psychological symptoms that likely will increase in prevalence and require innovative solutions in both science and practice. Implications for new research directions, clinical approaches, and policy issues are discussed to highlight the opportunities for clinical psychological science to emerge as an updated, contemporary field capable of addressing the burden of mental illness and distress in the wake of COVID-19 and beyond.

More important than the intensity of the disorder is its prevalence. When we compare our current knowledge of the impact of the pandemic on the development of mental disorders with the findings of research on acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) over the last 40 years, it may turn out that they are different from each other, the symptomatic spectrum of mental disorders varies and the possibilities of an effective treatment are very limited. We cannot rule out that a new diagnostic category for specific mental disorders resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may emerge in the near future.

A cross-sectional study was conducted in 1049 employees using online self-administered questionnaire. Views on workplace policies were measured in term of agreement on its comprehensiveness, timeliness and transparency whereas HRQoL was measured using EQ-5D-5L Hong Kong version. Univariate estimates on the impact of HRQoL from views of measures in workplace was done. Qualitative comments on the suggestions to strengthen workplace measures were collected and presented descriptively. Of 1048 respondents, 16% reported that no workplace measures nor guidelines were existed in their company related to the COVID-19 pandemics. Those who reported having workplace policy were not satisfied with the arrangement in term of comprehensiveness (36%), timeliness (38%), and transparency (63%). Regarding to the policy measure, only 68% respondents reported that their workplace supplied face masks to them. The health index was 0897, which was lower than the norm of 0.924. 64% of respondents reported having a health problem in at least 1 of 5 dimension of EQ-5D-5L with the highest proportion of having problem in anxiety/depression (55%). In addition, the workplace policy and measure had a direct effect of 0.131 on health outcome. Perception of infection risk had a direct effect of 0.218 on health outcome and partly mediated the relationship between workplace policy and measure and health outcome (0.066). The study highlighted the workplace policy and measure is an important mean to minimize infection risk at workplace so as to reduce tremendous stress and health outcome caused by a COVID-19 pandemic. Workplace measures related to COVID-19 pandemic should be further strengthen to mitigate the risk of infection and protect employee's health.","Wong, Ho, Wong, Cheung, Yau, Dong, Yeoh","https://doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2020.127","20200810","COVID-19; Employees; Health-Related Quality of Health; Hong Kong; Occupational Health; Workplace Policies","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged â‰¥17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score&gt;5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3Â Â±Â 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0Â Â±Â 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6Â Â±Â 1.2Â h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study may be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Yang, Zhu, Yang, Lin, Chen, Zhao, Fu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034","20200903","COVID-19; China; Occupational population; Pittsburgh sleep quality index; Poor sleep quality","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Negative impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on mental health service access and follow-up adherence for immigrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties","Lockdown measures in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have serious mental health effects on the population, especially in vulnerable groups, such as those living in poor socio-economic conditions, those who are homeless, migrant workers and asylum seekers/refugees. In addition, these vulnerable groups frequently have greater difficulty accessing health services and in treatment adherence. The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of the COVID-19-related lockdown on service utilisation and follow-up adherence in an Italian mental health outpatient service for migrants and individuals in socio-economic difficulties. The design of this study is a retrospective cross-sectional study. All patients who visited the mental health outpatient service in the months of February and March in the years 2017-2020 were included in the study. To compare service utilisation before and after the lockdown, the number of patients who visited the mental health outpatient service for psychiatric interview were recorded. Follow-up adherence was calculated as the percentage of patients who visited in February and subsequently attended a follow-up visit in March of the same year. The number of patients who visited the outpatient service between February 2017 and February 2020 was continuously increasing. In March 2020, fewer patients visited the service for psychiatric interview, in line with the introduction of lockdown measures. In addition, the number of the patients who visited in February 2020 and returned for their follow-up visits in March 2020 declined from approximately 30% over the same months in 2017-2019 to 17.53% in March 2020. The lockdown-related reduction in numbers of patients accessing the mental health service makes it difficult to help vulnerable populations during a period of time in which their mental health needs are expected to increase. Moreover, the reduction seen in follow-up compliance increases the risk of treatment discontinuation and possible relapse. Proactive alternative strategies need to be developed to reach these vulnerable populations.","Aragona, Barbato, Cavani, Costanzo, Mirisola","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.055","20200903","Coronavirus; Homeless; Immigrants; Mental health; Refugees; Service utilisation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in health professionals: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Psychological suffering by health professionals may be associated with the uncertainty of a safe workplace. Front-line professionals exposed and involved in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients are more susceptible. This review was conducted based on papers that were published at MEDLINE, BMJ, PsycINFO, and LILACS, the according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA). Health professionals had a higher level of anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01, ORÂ =Â 1.6152; 95%CI 1.3283 to 1.9641; pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001) and depression 12.2 vs. 9.5%; pÂ =Â 0.04; ORÂ =Â 1.3246; 95%CI 1.0930 to 1.6053; pÂ =Â 0.0042), besides somatizations and insomnia compared to professionals from other areas.

Insomnia was a risk factor for both.","da Silva, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110062","20200824","COVID-19; Mental health; Psychological suffering","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (nâ€¯=â€¯125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, nâ€¯=â€¯250) and healthy controls (HC, nâ€¯=â€¯250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19-26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (ORâ€¯=â€¯0.721; 95% CI: 0.579-0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (betaâ€¯=â€¯0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (betaâ€¯=â€¯-0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.","GonzÃ¡lez-Blanco, Dal Santo, GarcÃ­a-Ãlvarez, de la Fuente-TomÃ¡s, Moya Lacasa, Paniagua, SÃ¡iz, GarcÃ­a-Portilla, Bobes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018","20200814","Anxiety; Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Pandemics; Psychological distress; Psychosis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Testing an early online intervention for the treatment of disturbed sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic (Sleep COVID-19): structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","The primary aim of the present study is to examine the efficacy of an online intervention for poor sleep in the context of an ongoing stressful major life event, by assessing if this intervention can reduce insomnia severity at short-term (one week post-intervention) and long-term (one and three months post-intervention) follow-up time points. It is hypothesised that the intervention will: 1) reduce insomnia severity in poor sleepers, compared to wait-list control poor sleepers, and good sleepers; 2) reduce subjective symptoms of anxiety and depression in all groups, and 3) prevent the transition to acute insomnia in good sleepers. This study is a cluster randomised controlled trial. Both healthy good sleepers, who do not report having any current sleep problems, and individuals who report having sleep problems, will be recruited for the present study. This is a single-site study (Northumbria University). This study will be delivered using the internet and there are no geographic restrictions. Individuals who self-report as poor sleepers will meet DSM-5 criteria for acute insomnia, which is where individuals: 1) have difficulties in falling asleep, staying asleep, or awakening too early for at least three nights per week, for a time period of between two weeks and three months; and 2) report experiencing distress or impairment caused by sleep loss. Both 1) and 2) must have occurred despite the individual having had an adequate opportunity for sleep during this time period. Good sleepers will be individuals who do not have current sleep problems. All participants must have a sufficient level of English comprehension to understand and complete study measures. Individuals cannot participate if they report having chronic sleep problems (where they have existed for more than three months immediately prior to providing consent), nor will individuals who are actively seeking treatment for their sleep problems irrespective of how long they have had the sleep problem. Individuals also cannot participate if they have a self-reported history of head injuries, or if they have a self-reported diagnosis of schizophrenia, epilepsy or personality disorder, as the distraction techniques involved in the insomnia intervention may increase rumination in individuals with these conditions, and influence the effectiveness of the intervention. Participants who receive the intervention will be provided with an online version of a self-help leaflet. A printed version of this leaflet has been successfully used in previous treatment studies, which have been conducted by our research group. Participants will be encouraged to download, save or print out this leaflet, which will be provided in PDF format. There will be no restrictions on use and participants will be encouraged to refer to this leaflet as often as they wish to. Briefly, this self-help leaflet aims to improve sleep by identifying and addressing sleep-related dysfunctional thinking by providing education about sleep, providing techniques to distract from intrusive worrisome thoughts at night, and providing guidelines for sleep-related stimulus control. The comparator is a wait-list control (i.e. where they will receive the intervention after a one month delay) group. The primary outcome measure will be insomnia severity, as measured using the Insomnia Severity Index (Bastien, ValliÃ¨res, &amp; Morin, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention and at one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures will include subjective mood, measured using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7; Spitzer, Kroenke, Williams, &amp; Lowe, 2006)) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001), assessed immediately prior to the intervention, and one week, one month and three months post-intervention, compared to baseline. Additionally, subjective sleep continuity, derived from sleep diaries (Carney et al., 2012), will be compared pre and post-intervention. This study will operate as a cluster randomised controlled trial. Good sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or a no-intervention group, with a 1:1 allocation. Poor sleepers will be randomised into an intervention or wait-list control group, with a 1:1 allocation. Randomisation will be conducted automatically using Qualtrics study software, where block sizes will be equal and randomisation will be computer-generated. Participants will not be blinded to group assignment. The outcomes will be assessed by a blinded investigator. The minimum sample size is 60. A total of 30 poor sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or wait-list control group. A total of 30 good sleepers will be randomised to the intervention or no intervention group. Recruitment for this study has yet to start. It is anticipated that recruitment will begin in August 2020 and end in April 2022.

"Comparison of the severity of psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population regarding COVID-19 pandemic","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused serious psychological problems, including panic attack, anxiety, stress, and depression. The main objective of this study was to measure the prevalence and compare the severity of this psychological distress among four groups of an Iranian population. In a cross-sectional survey, the mental health status of four groups of an Iranian society including community population, patients with COVID-19, medical staff, and medical students were investigated by the self-report questionnaire of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS). DASS-21 questionnaire and the demographic data sheet were filled out by the participants. All statistical analyses were done using R version 3.6.1 software. P-values less than 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. ANOVA test was used to compare the severity of stress, anxiety, and depression between the four study groups. Of the 886 participants in this survey, 554 (62.5%) were men and 332 (37.5%) were women, and the meanâ€‰Â±â€‰standard division of age was 40.91â€‰Â±â€‰10.7â€‰years. Among these participants, 241 (27.2%) were selected from community population, 221 (24.9%) were patients with COVID-19, 217 (24.5%) were medical staff, and 207 (23.4%) were medical students. The mean score of stress, anxiety, and depression in medical students and patients with COVID-19 was significantly higher than in medical staff and community population (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05). Overall, the anxiety score in men was higher than that in women (27.4â€‰Â±â€‰4.6 vs. 26.48â€‰Â±â€‰4.8, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.006), and unmarried participants had a significantly higher depression score compared with the married group (27.5â€‰Â±â€‰4.8 vs. 26.7â€‰Â±â€‰4.6, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.023). In addition, the score of depression was higher in female medical staff (27.08â€‰Â±â€‰4.6 vs. 25.33â€‰Â±â€‰4.3, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.011) and community population (26.6â€‰Â±â€‰4.3 vs. 25.3â€‰Â±â€‰4.3, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.02) than in male. COVID-19 patients and medical students in contact with these patients were at a high risk for mental illness due to lower experience compared with professional medical staff and community population.

"COVID-19 anxiety among front-line nurses: Predictive role of organisational support, personal resilience and social support","This study examines the relative influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety in front-line nurses. Anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic is prevalent in the nursing workforce, potentially affecting nurses' well-being and work performance. Identifying factors that could help maintain mental health and reduce coronavirus-related anxiety among front-line nurses is imperative. Currently, no studies have been conducted examining the influence of personal resilience, social support and organisational support in reducing COVID-19 anxiety among nurses. This cross-sectional study involved 325 registered nurses from the Philippines using four standardized scales. Of the 325 nurses in the study, 123 (37.8%) were found to have dysfunctional levels of anxiety. Using multiple linear regression analyses, social support (Î²Â =Â -0.142, pÂ =Â .011), personal resilience (Î²Â =Â -0.151, pÂ =Â .008) and organisational support (Î²Â =Â -0.127, pÂ =Â .023) predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Nurse characteristics were not associated with COVID-19 anxiety. Resilient nurses and those who perceived higher organisational and social support were more likely to report lower anxiety related to COVID-19. COVID-19 anxiety may be addressed through organisational interventions, including increasing social support, assuring adequate organisational support, providing psychological and mental support services and providing resilience-promoting and stress management interventions.","Labrague, De Los Santos","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13121","20200821","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; coronavirus; nursing; organisational support; resilience; social support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental distress in dermatologists during COVID-19 pandemic: Assessment and risk factors in a global, cross-sectional study","There is a sparsity of data regarding the mental health status of dermatologists during COVID-19 pandemic. Evaluate the effects of pandemic on mental health of dermatologists on a large scale and identify risk factors for mental distress. 733 dermatologists were included in this cross-sectional, web-based survey. Mental distress was reported by 77.2% of responders. Considerable percentages of participants experienced stress (73.9%), irritation (33.7%), insomnia (30%), or depression (27.6%), and 78.6% were overwhelmed with the amount of pandemic information they were receiving. Mental distress was significantly associated with practice years, volume of patients seen per week before pandemic, personal protective equipment availability at hospital (P = .001 for each), practice location (continent; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), and participant's assessment that the healthcare system was not equipped for the pandemic (P = .003). Stress was associated with hospital service (P = .003), and depression with being overwhelmed with the amount of pandemic information received (P = .004). In a logistic model, teledermatology use was the most powerful predictor of mental distress (OR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.07-2.32]). Mental distress was common among dermatologists during this pandemic. Teledermatology use was the most powerful predictor of mental distress.

"Symptoms of burnout in intensive care unit specialists facing the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented healthcare crisis with a high prevalence of psychological distress in healthcare providers. We sought to document the prevalence ofÂ burnout syndrome amongst intensivists facing the COVID-19 outbreak. Cross-sectional survey among intensivists part of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. Symptoms of severe burnout, anxiety and depression were collected. Factors independently associated withÂ severe burnout were assessed using Cox model. Response rate was 20% (1001 completed questionnaires were returned, 45Â years [39-53], 34% women, from 85 countries, 12 regions, 50% university-affiliated hospitals). The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety and depression or severe burnout was 46.5%, 30.2%, and 51%, respectively, and varied significantly across regions. Rating of the relationship between intensivists and other ICU stakeholders differed significantly according to the presence of anxiety, depression, or burnout. Similar figures were reported for their rating of the ethical climate or the quality of the decision-making. Factors independently associated with anxiety were female gender (HR 1.85 [1.33-2.55]), working in a university-affiliated hospital (HR 0.58 [0.42-0.80]), living in a city ofâ€‰&gt;â€‰1Â million inhabitants (HR 1.40 [1.01-1.94]), and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.83 [0.77-0.90]). Independent determinants of depression included female gender (HR 1.63 [1.15-2.31]) and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.84 [0.78-0.92]). Factors independently associated with symptoms of severe burnout included age (HR 0.98/year [0.97-0.99]) and clinician's rating of the ethical climate (HR 0.76 [0.69-0.82]).

"Orthopaedic Guidelines for the COVID-19 Post-Outbreak Period: Experience from Wuhan, People's Republic of China","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has rapidly spread worldwide. As the earliest outbreak area of the pandemic, Wuhan, People's Republic of China, is gradually recovering to its normal state under the effective control of government authorities. Outpatient services in major hospitals are now being restored. An accumulation of asymptomatic infections is a potential risk for medical personnel, especially when there is crowding in hospitals. As the biggest center for orthopaedic patients in Wuhan, our orthopaedic outpatient department admits &gt;300 patients per day. Optimal guidelines on how to handle this huge number of patients during the post-outbreak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to potential asymptomatic infection, are urgently needed for orthopaedic surgeons. We have developed and proposed applicable guidelines to fill this knowledge gap, including the necessary protective strategies for medical personnel in orthopaedic outpatient and inpatient wards as well as during surgery. We also have provided mental health recommendations for health-care workers. To the best of our knowledge, these guidelines are the first of their kind for orthopaedic surgeons who are slowly reestablishing medical activity following the pandemic.","Xiong, Chen, Lin, Panayi, Mi, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.20.00773","20200827","Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Infection Control; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"An analysis on self-management and treatment-related functionality and characteristics of highly rated anxiety apps","Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Drissi, Ouhbi, Janati Idrissi, Ghogho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243","20200825","Anxiety; M-health; Mental health; Mobile apps; Mobile mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients","While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives. The majority of coronavirus disease deaths are due to pneumonia. Mostly, stress and depression are associated with coronavirus disease infection and thus, resulting in weakening of patients' immune response and hence, more severe respiratory symptoms or even death. We propose using a class of antidepressants named selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for their reported potential antiviral effect, modulatory effect of respiratory symptoms, antioxidant properties and immunoregulatory effects beside their main action as antidepressant. In addition, the low cost of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might add a benefit for coronavirus disease patients.","Hamed, Hagag","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140","20200812","COVID-19; Cytokines; Depression; Pneumonia; SSRIs","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Who is lonely in lockdown? Cross-cohort analyses of predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic","There are concerns internationally that lockdown measures taken during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic could lead to a rise in loneliness. As loneliness is recognised as a major public health concern, it is therefore vital that research considers the impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic on loneliness to provide necessary support. But it remains unclear, who is lonely in lockdown? This study compared sociodemographic predictors of loneliness before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using cross-cohort analyses of data from UK adults captured before the pandemic (UK Household Longitudinal Study, nÂ =Â 31,064) and during the pandemic (UCL (University College London) COVID-19 Social Study, nÂ =Â 60,341). Risk factors for loneliness were near identical before and during the pandemic. Young adults, women, people with lower education or income, the economically inactive, people living alone and urban residents had a higher risk of being lonely. Some people who were already at risk of being lonely (e.g. young adults aged 18-30 years, people with low household income and adults living alone) experienced a heightened risk during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with people living before COVID-19 emerged. Furthermore, being a student emerged as a higher risk factor during lockdown than usual. Findings suggest that interventions to reduce or prevent loneliness during COVID-19 should be targeted at those sociodemographic groups already identified as high risk in previous research. These groups are likely not just to experience loneliness during the pandemic but potentially to have an even higher risk than normal of experiencing loneliness relative to low-risk groups.","Bu, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.036","20200903","COVID-19; Loneliness; Pandemic; Social isolation; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Surgical Education in the Time of COVID: Understanding the Early Response of Surgical Training Programs to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic","Describe the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery residency training nationwide. A 31-question electronic survey was distributed to general surgery program directors. Qualitative data underwent iterative coding analysis. Quantitative data were evaluated with summary statistics and bivariate analyses. Eighty-four residency programs (33.6% response rate) with representation across US geographic regions, program affiliations, and sizes. Widespread changes were observed in the surgical training environment. One hundred percent of programs reduced the number of residents on rounds and 95.2% reduced the size of their in-hospital resident workforce; on average, daytime staffing decreased by nearly half. With telehealth clinics (90.5%) and remote inpatient consults (26.2%), both clinical care and resident didactics (86.9%) were increasingly virtual, with similar impact across all program demographics. Conversely, availability of some wellness initiatives was significantly higher among university programs than independent programs, including childcare (51.2% vs 6.7%), housing (41.9% vs 13.3%), and virtual mental health services (83.7% vs 53.3%). Changes in clinical care delivery dramatically reduced in face-to-face learning opportunities for surgical trainees during the COVID-19 pandemic. While this effect had equal impact across all program types, sizes, and geographies, the same cannot be said for wellness initiatives. Though all programs initiated some strategies to protect resident health, the disparity between university programs and independent programs may be cause for action.","White, Shaughnessy, Esposito, Slade, Korah, Yoo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.036","20200812","COVID-19; coronavirus; general surgery; graduate medical education; resident wellness; virtual education","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

One such measure was a 'total lockdown' for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","Nadkarni, Kapoor, Pathare","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200827","Alcohol; Autonomy; COVID-19; Harm minimisation; India; Prohibition; Alcohol Abstinence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Federal Government; Harm Reduction; Human Rights; Humans; India; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Quarantine; State Government; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Isolation of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: An ethical, legal, and practical challenge","Psychiatric inpatients are particularly vulnerable to the transmission and effects of COVID-19. As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual's right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation. We then interrogate the practicality of currently available approaches by applying them to a series of hypothetical cases. There are currently no 'neat' or practicable solutions to the problem of lawfully isolating patients on mental health units, and we discuss the myriad issues with both mental health and public health law approaches to the problem. We conclude by making some suggestions to policymakers.","Brown, Ruck Keene, Hooper, O'Brien","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101572","20200827","COVID-19; Isolation; Mental Health Act; Public health law; Seclusion; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; England; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Infection Control; Mental Competency; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Wales","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Ontario's response to COVID-19 shows that mental health providers must be integrated into provincial public health insurance systems","The fear, grief, social isolation, and financial and occupational losses from COVID-19 have created a mental health crisis. Ontario's response highlights the shortcomings of its physician-only public healthcare system that limits public access to appropriate and sustainable mental healthcare. Specifically, Ontario's attempt to rapidly expand mental healthcare access in response to COVID-19 includes new Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP) billing codes that enable physicians to provide telephonic trauma counselling and patient self-serve online tools while psychologist and other registered mental health provider services have been largely left out of the provincial response. Why? Non-physician mental health providers operate outside of the provincial healthcare infrastructure, including the provincial payer (i.e., OHIP) that facilitated the provincial physician response. A physician-centric mental healthcare system limits public access to quality, sustainable, evidence-based mental health services because most physicians do not have the capacity, training, or desire to provide mental health services. To improve public access to needed mental health services, provinces should integrate psychologists and other registered mental health providers directly into their public health insurance systems. Integrated providers can be strategically and sustainably mobilized to respond to COVID-19 and future mental health crises.","Scharf, Oinonen","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00397-0","20200825","COVID-19; Equity; Mental health; Physicians; Public health insurance; Sustainability; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; National Health Programs; Ontario; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence and Influencing Factors on Fatigue of First-line Nurses Combating with COVID-19 in China: A Descriptive Cross-Sectional Study","Nurses' work-related fatigue has been recognized as a threat to nurse health and patient safety. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of fatigue among first-line nurses combating with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, and to analyze its influencing factors on fatigue. A multi-center, descriptive, cross-sectional design with a convenience sample was used. The statistical population consisted of the first-line nurses in 7 tertiary general hospitals from March 3, 2020 to March 10, 2020 in Wuhan of China. A total of 2667 samples from 2768 contacted participants completed the investgation, with a response rate of 96.35%. Social-demographic questionnaire, work-related questionnaire, Fatigue Scale-14, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Chinese Perceived Stress Scale were used to conduct online survey. The descriptive statistic of nurses' social-demographic characteristics was conducted, and the related variables of work, anxiety, depression, perceived stress and fatigue were analyzed by t-tests, nonparametric test and Pearson's correlation analysis. The significant factors which resulted in nurses' fatigue were further analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. The median score for the first-line nurses' fatigue in Wuhan was 4 (2, 8). The median score of physical and mental fatigue of them was 3 (1, 6) and 1 (0, 3) respectively. According to the scoring criteria, 35.06% nurses (n=935) of all participants were in the fatigue status, their median score of fatigue was 10 (8, 11), and the median score of physical and mental fatigue of them was 7 (5, 8) and 3 (2, 4) respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed the participants in the risk groups of anxiety, depression and perceived stress had higher scores on physical and mental fatigue and the statistically significant positive correlation was observed between the variables and nurses' fatigue, the frequency of exercise and nurses' fatigue had a statistically significant negative correlation, and average daily working hours had a significantly positive correlation with nurses' fatigue, and the frequency of weekly night shift had a low positive correlation with nurses' fatigue (P&lt;0.01). There was a moderate level of fatigue among the first-line nurses fighting against COVID-19 pandemic in Wuhan, China. Government and health authorities need to formulate and take effective intervention strategies according to the relevant risk factors, and undertake preventive measures aimed at reducing health hazards due to increased work-related fatigue among first-line nurses, and to enhance their health status and provide a safe occupational environment worldwide. Promoting both medical and nursing safety while combating with the pandemic currently is warranted.","Zhan, Zhao, Yuan, Liu, Liu, Gui, Zheng, Zhou, Qiu, Chen, Yu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11596-020-2226-9","20200831","COVID-19; Chinese nurses; anxiety; cross-sectional study; depression; fatigue; pandemic; perceived stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The aim of this study was to characterize the extent to which NYC metropolitan area school websites communicated to students their updated mental health service offerings, psychoeducational information related to COVID-19, and community-based resources after the abrupt end to on-campus services during the Spring semester. A total ofÂ 138 websites were analyzed. Overall, only half of the surveyed web pages provided information about remote counseling, and just under two thirds of schools (57.97%) had directions for students experiencing a mental health emergency. As predicted, enrollment size was associated with whether psychoeducation about mental health and COVID-19 and information about remote counseling were available on a school's website. In both cases, medium-sized schools were the most likely to have these resources available on their websites as compared to small and large-sized schools. College counseling center web pages should include robust and current information that targets schools' diverse student bodies.","Seidel, Mohlman, Basch, Fera, Cosgrove, Ethan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00905-w","20200811","COVID-19; College students; Mental health; Website messaging","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Challenges and management of neurological and psychiatric manifestations in SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) patients","COVID-19 is a pandemic caused by human coronavirus (HCoV) SARS-CoV-2, which originated in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and spread globally during 2020. Due to the difficulty of clinical decision-making during this period, our study group reviewed current literature focusing on the neurological and psychiatric aspects of COVID-19. Despite the knowledge on this newly discovered virus which is constantly evolving, different pieces of evidence reported an association between COVID-19 and neurological symptoms like headache, dizziness, taste and smell disorders and complications involving the nervous system eventually triggered by the pathologic processes elicited by SARS-CoV-2. It seems that younger patients are less prone to develop severe forms of COVID-19. However, neurological signs have been reported in paediatric patients as well, and in some cases, the infection presented neurological sequelae. Furthermore, children with particular neurological diseases or treated with specific drugs (e.g. immune-suppressant therapies) must be carefully monitored during this pandemic. Neurologists should be aware of the main drug-drug interactions and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 treatments. Notably, adverse mental health impact has been reported in patients with SARS-CoV-2, which could be related either to the social strain or to the eventual neurotropic effects of the virus, which in other infections have been proven to promote the onset of psychiatric symptoms. Further, psychiatric population may be more vulnerable to the infection and at higher risk for adverse outcomes.","Orsini, Corsi, Santangelo, Riva, Peroni, Foiadelli, Savasta, Striano","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04544-w","20200817","Brain; CNS; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Neurologic; Psychiatric; SARS-CoV-2; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Decision-Making; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Management; Humans; Mental Disorders; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological burden of healthcare professionals in Germany during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic: differences and similarities in the international context","Healthcare professionals (HPs) are the key figures to keep up the healthcare system during the COVID-19 pandemic and thus are one of the most vulnerable groups in this. To this point, the extent of this psychological burden, especially in Europe and Germany, remains unclear. This is the first study investigating German HPs after the COVID-19 outbreak. We performed an online-based cross-sectional study after the COVID-19 outbreak in Germany (10-31 March 2020). In total, 2224 HPs (physicians nÂ =Â 492, nursing staff nÂ =Â 1511, paramedics nÂ =Â 221) and 10Â 639 non-healthcare professionals (nHPs) were assessed including generalized anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), current health status (EQ-5D-3L), COVID-19-related fear, subjective level of information regarding COVID-19. HPs showed less generalized anxiety, depression and COVID-19-related fear and higher health status and subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 than the nHPs. Within the HP groups, nursing staff were the most psychologically burdened. Subjective levels of information regarding COVID-19 correlated negatively with generalized anxiety levels across all groups. Among HPs, nursing staff showed the highest and paramedics the lowest generalized anxiety levels. In the context of COVID-19, German HPs seem to be less psychological burdened than nHPs, and also less burdened compared with existing international data.","Skoda, Teufel, Stang, JÃ¶ckel, Junne, WeismÃ¼ller, Hetkamp, Musche, Kohler, DÃ¶rrie, Schweda, BÃ¤uerle","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa124","20200901","COVID-19; generalized anxiety; healthcare professionals; information; psychological burden","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Accounting for external factors and early intervention adoption in the design and analysis of stepped-wedge designs: Application to a proposed study design to reduce opioid-related mortality","Stepped-wedge designs (SWDs) are currently being used to investigate interventions to reduce opioid overdose deaths in communities located in several states. However, these interventions are competing with external factors such as newly initiated public policies limiting opioid prescriptions, media awareness campaigns, and social distancing orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, control communities may prematurely adopt components of the proposed intervention as they become widely available. These types of events induce confounding of the intervention effect by time. Such confounding is a well-known limitation of SWDs; a common approach to adjusting for it makes use of a mixed effects modeling framework that includes both fixed and random effects for time. However, these models have several shortcomings when multiple confounding factors are present. We discuss the limitations of existing methods based on mixed effects models in the context of proposed SWDs to investigate interventions intended to reduce mortality associated with the opioid epidemic, and propose solutions to accommodate deviations from assumptions that underlie these models. We conduct an extensive simulation study of anticipated data from SWD trials targeting the current opioid epidemic in order to examine the performance of these models under different sources of confounding. We specifically examine the impact of factors external to the study and premature adoption of intervention components. When only external factors are present, our simulation studies show that commonly used mixed effects models can result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, but have inflated Type 1 error and result in under coverage of confidence intervals. These models are severely biased when confounding factors differentially impact intervention and control clusters; premature adoption of intervention components is an example of this scenario. In these scenarios, models that incorporate fixed intervention-by-time interaction terms and an unstructured covariance for the intervention-by-cluster-by-time random effects result in unbiased estimates of the intervention effect, reach nominal confidence interval coverage, and preserve Type 1 error, but may reduce power. The incorporation of fixed and random time effects in mixed effects models require certain assumptions about the impact of confounding by time in SWD. Violations of these assumptions can result in severe bias of the intervention effect estimate, under coverage of confidence intervals, and inflated Type 1 error. Since model choice has considerable impact on study power as well as validity of results, careful consideration needs to be given to choosing an appropriate model that takes into account potential confounding factors.","Rennert, Heo, Litwin, de Grutolla","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.26.20162297","20200811",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers","The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47-0.97; <i>p</i>Â =Â 0.032), years of working &gt;10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47-2.79; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27-1.80; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77-6.05; <i>p</i>&lt;0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02-1.48; <i>p</i>Â =Â 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60-0.97; <i>p</i>Â =Â 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53-0.89; <i>p</i>Â =Â 0.004) were associated with stress. Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.","Zhu, Xu, Wang, Liu, Wu, Li, Miao, Zhang, Yang, Sun, Zhu, Fan, Chen, Hu, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443","20200811",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Frontline nurses' burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (<i>n</i>Â =Â 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (<i>n</i>Â =Â 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (<i>n</i>Â =Â 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (<i>n</i>Â =Â 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers.

"Seven Shades of Black Thoughts: COVID-19 and Its Psychological Consequences on Cancer Patients","An outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that started in China at the end of 2019 has rapidly spread all over the world. COVID-19 is plaguing people not only physically but also psychologically, and cancer patients are particularly exposed to this emotional threat. Herein, we describe the psychological threats posed by COVID-19 to cancer patients. Our analysis is based on the concerns of our patients during our daily clinical interactions in both outpatient and inpatient settings. We have summarized the patients' psychological issues: logistic overload, loneliness, fear, oxymoronic thoughts, helplessness, frustration, and emotional siege. We describe these psychological threats, provide clinical context for them, and offer practical suggestions for managing them, for the benefit of patients, their caregivers, and clinicians. Our hope is that, by sharing our clinical experience, we can help other oncologists increase their awareness of the psychological impact of the pandemic on cancer patients and implement solutions. Managing these challenges now should translate into improved standards of care when this infective storm is over. Paradoxically, COVID-19 could be an opportunity to learn how to better manage cancer care.","Garutti, Cortiula, Puglisi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01357","20200811","COVID-19; SARS-COV-2; cancer; loneliness; psycho-oncology; quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Evidence map on the contributions of traditional, complementary and integrative medicines for health care in times of COVID-19","Due to the pandemic, there is a significant interest in the therapeutic resources linked to TCIM to support potentially therapeutic research and intervention in the management of Coronavirus - 19 (COVID-19). At the date of this evidence mapÂ´s publication, there is no evidence of specific treatments for COVID-19. This map organizes information about symptoms management (especially on dimensions related to mental health and mild viral respiratory infections, as well as immune system strengthening and antiviral activity). This evidence map applies methodology developed by Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information based on the 3iE evidence gap map. A search was performed in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine Virtual Health Library and PubMed, using the MeSH and DeCS terms for respiratory viral diseases associated with epidemics, COVID-19 symptoms, relevant mental health topics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions related to TCIM. For the map, 126 systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies were characterized, distributed in a matrix with 62 interventions (18 phytotherapy, 9 mind-body therapies, 11 traditional Chinese medicine, 7 homeopathic and anthroposophic dynamized medicines and 17 supplements), and 67 outcomes (14 immunological response, 23 mental health, 25 complementary clinical management of the infection and 5 other). The map presents an overview of possible TCIM contributions to various dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the field of mental health, and it is directed to researchers and health professionals specialized in TCIM. Most of the antiviral activity outcomes described in this map refers to respiratory viruses in general, and not specifically to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2).

"Perceived Risk and Protection From Infection and Depressive Symptoms Among Healthcare Workers in Mainland China and Hong Kong During COVID-19","Psychological health among healthcare workers (HCWs) has become a major concern since the COVID-19 outbreak. HCWs perceived risks of contracting COVID-19, in relation to depression were investigated. It was hypothesized that perceived high risk of contracting COVID-19 (close contact with cases, inadequate provision of personal protective equipment, insufficient infection control training, and presence of symptoms) would be significant predictors of depression. Our cross-sectional survey was completed by HCWs across three regions (Hubei, Guangdong, Hong Kong) between March 9 to April 9 2020 using convenience sampling. Depression was assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Prevalence of depression was 50.4% (95% CI: 44.5-56.2), 15.1% (10.1-21.9) and 12.9% (10.3-16.2) for HCWs in Hong Kong, Hubei and Guangdong, respectively. The strongest significant risk factors for depression, after adjustment, were HCWs who reported the greatest extent of feeling susceptible to contracting COVID-19 and those who reported the greatest difficulty obtaining face masks. HCWs whose family/peers greatly encouraged face mask use had lower prevalence of depression. Access to adequate supplies of personal protective equipment is essential for the psychological health of HCWs working in stressful environments, through potentially easing their perceptions of vulnerability to COVID-19.","Lam, Arora, Grey, Suen, Huang, Li, Lam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00686","20200811","COVID-19; depression; healthcare workers; perceived vulnerability; personal protective equipment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Obstetrics Healthcare Providers' Mental Health and Quality of Life During COVID-19 Pandemic: Multicenter Study from Eight Cities in Iran","The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the most challenging issue for healthcare organizations and governments all over the world. The lack of evidence-based data on the management of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes an additional stress for obstetrics healthcare providers (HCPs). Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate depression, perceived social support, and quality of life among obstetrics HCPs. This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in eight cities in Iran. During the study period, 599 HCPs were separated into direct, no direct, and unknown contact groups according to their exposure to COVID-19-infected pregnant patients. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) were used to assess depression, perceived social support, and quality of life. Obstetrics and gynecology specialists had significantly higher social functioning and general health scores compared to other HCPs (residents/students or nurses/midwives). Depression was negatively correlated with most of the domains of quality of life, regardless of the COVID-19 contact status of the study participants. Social support, however, was positively correlated with some domains of quality of life, such as physical functioning, energy/fatigue, and emotional well-being, among staff members who had either direct contact or no contact with COVID-19 patients.

"Emotional responses and coping strategies in nurses and nursing students during Covid-19 outbreak: A comparative study","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in December has seen more than 76,000 cases in China, causing more than 3,000 medical staff infections. As the disease is highly contagious, can be fatal in severe cases, and there are no specific medicines, it poses a huge threat to the life and health of nurses, leading to a severe impact on their emotional responses and coping strategies. Therefore, this study will investigate nurses' emotional responses and coping styles, and conduct a comparative study with nursing college students. This study was conducted through the online survey 'questionnaire star' from February 1st to February 20th, 2020 in Anhui Province, using the snowball sampling method to invite subjects. The results found that women showed more severe anxiety and fear than men. Participants from cities exhibited these symptoms more than participants from rural areas, however rural participants experienced more sadness than urban participants. The nearer a COVID-19 zone is to the participants, the stronger the anxiety and anger. The COVID-19 outbreak has placed immense pressure on hospitals and those nurses at the frontline are more seriously affected. Hospitals should focus on providing psychological support to nurses and training in coping strategies.","Huang, Lei, Xu, Liu, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237303","20200828","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Staff, Hospital; Middle Aged; Nurses; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sex Factors; Stress, Psychological; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health of Medical and Non-Medical Professionals during the Peak of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Nationwide Study","The study aimed to compare psychopathological expressions during the COVID-19 (novel coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic, as declared on March 11th 2020 by the World Health Organization, with respect to which institutional variables might distinguish the impact of COVID-19 in medical and non-medical professionals. A cross-sectional study was performed nationwide between 16th March and the 26th April 2020 in Poland. A total of 2039 respondents representing all healthcare providers (59.8%) as well as other professionals filled in the sociodemographic section, the General Health Questionnaire-28 and the author's questionnaire with questions related to exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, the availability of protective measures, quarantine, change of working hours and place of employment during the pandemic, as well as feelings associated with the state of the pandemic. Medical professionals more often presented with relevant psychopathological symptoms (GHQ-28 (General Health Questionnaire-28) total score &gt;24) than the non-medical group (60.8% vs. 48.0%, respectively) such as anxiety, insomnia and somatic symptoms even after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Male sex, older age and appropriate protective equipment were associated with significantly lower GHQ-28 total scores in medical professionals, whereas among non-medical professionals, male sex was associated with significantly lower GHQ-28 total scores. Somatic and anxiety symptoms as well as insomnia are more prevalent among medical staff than workers in other professions. Targeting the determinants of these differences should be included in interventions aimed at restoring psychological well-being in this specific population. Apparently, there are present gender differences in psychological responses that are independent of profession.","Maciaszek, Ciulkowicz, Misiak, Szczesniak, Luc, Wieczorek, Fila-Witecka, Gawlowski, Rymaszewska","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9082527","20200903","SARS-CoV-2; healthcare personnel; infectious disease; psychiatry; psychopathological symptoms","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and Parent-Child Psychological Well-being","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has changed American society in ways that are difficult to capture in a timely manner. With this study, we take advantage of daily survey data collected before and after the crisis started to investigate the hypothesis that the crisis has worsened parents' and children's psychological well-being. We also examine the extent of crisis-related hardships and evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of hardships will be associated with parent and child psychological well-being. Daily survey data were collected between February 20 and April 27, 2020, from hourly service workers with a young child (aged 2-7) in a large US city (<i>N</i> = 8222 person-days from 645 individuals). A subsample completed a one-time survey about the effects of the crisis fielded between March 23 and April 26 (subsample <i>n</i> = 561). Ordered probit models revealed that the frequency of parent-reported daily negative mood increased significantly since the start of the crisis. Many families have experienced hardships during the crisis, including job loss, income loss, caregiving burden, and illness. Both parents' and children's well-being in the postcrisis period was strongly associated with the number of crisis-related hardships that the family experienced. Consistent with our hypotheses, in families that have experienced multiple hardships related to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, both parents' and children's mental health is worse. As the crisis continues to unfold, pediatricians should screen for mental health, with particular attention to children whose families are especially vulnerable to economic and disease aspects of the crisis.","Gassman-Pines, Ananat, Fitz-Henley","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-007294","20200903",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Work-Related and Personal Factors Associated With Mental Well-Being During the COVID-19 Response: Survey of Health Care and Other Workers","The response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created an unprecedented disruption in work conditions. This study describes the mental health and well-being of workers both with and without clinical exposure to patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The aim of this study is to measure the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being among faculty and staff at a university and academic medical center during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and describe work-related and personal factors associated with their mental health and well-being. All faculty, staff, and postdoctoral fellows of a university, including its medical school, were invited in April 2020 to complete an online questionnaire measuring stress, anxiety, depression, work exhaustion, burnout, and decreased well-being. We examined associations between these outcomes and factors including work in high-risk clinical settings and family/home stressors. There were 5550 respondents (overall response rate of 34.3%). Overall, 34% of faculty and 14% of staff (n=915) were providing clinical care, while 61% of faculty and 77% of staff were working from home. Among all workers, anxiety (prevalence ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.09-1.73), depression (prevalence ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.03-1.59), and high work exhaustion (prevalence ratio 1.24, 95% CI 1.13-1.36) were independently associated with community or clinical exposure to COVID-19. Poor family-supportive behaviors by supervisors were also associated with these outcomes (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.21-1.62; prevalence ratio 1.69, 95% CI 1.48-1.92; and prevalence ratio 1.54, 95% CI 1.44-1.64, respectively). Age &lt;40 years and a greater number of family/home stressors were also associated with these poorer outcomes. Among the subset of clinicians, caring for patients with COVID-19 and working in high-risk clinical settings were additional risk factors. Our findings suggest that the pandemic has had negative effects on the mental health and well-being of both clinical and nonclinical employees. Mitigating exposure to COVID-19 and increasing supervisor support are modifiable risk factors that may protect mental health and well-being for all workers.","Evanoff, Strickland, Dale, Hayibor, Page, Duncan, Kannampallil, Gray","https://doi.org/10.2196/21366","20200902","COVID-19; coronavirus; health care workers; mental health; occupational health; pandemic; remote work; worker well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a large academic medical center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness","Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, written by family and healthcare workers during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay &gt;72â€¯h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24â€¯h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychological symptom screening with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at baseline within 1â€¯week of ICU discharge and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up, (nâ€¯=â€¯18) in the diary intervention group and (nâ€¯=â€¯17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. Results from psychological screening tools demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in clinical practice - patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier-prolonged psychological morbidity.

"Psychological impact of coronavirus disease (2019) (COVID-19) epidemic on medical staff in different posts in China: A multicenter study","An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a big challenge to medical staff and general public. The aim is to investigate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on medical staff in different working posts in China, and to explore the correlation between psychological disorder and the exposure to COVID-19. A multicenter WeChat-based online survey was conducted among medical staff in China between 26 February and 3 March 2020. Medical staff deployed to Hubei province from other provinces and medical staffs in different posts outside Hubei were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of COVID-19. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, stress and resilience were evaluated using scales including GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, PSS-14, and CD-RISC-10. Latent class analysis was performed to identify potential staff requiring psychological support. A total of 274 respondents were included, who serving at 4 posts as follows, staff backing Hubei province, isolation wards outside Hubei, fever clinic and infectious disease department, and other departments outside Hubei. The total scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and stress were statistically different among groups, meanwhile an increasing tendency of anxiety, depression and sleep quality scores with increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19 was found (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated that the staff backing Hubei had higher scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and perceived stress (adjusted pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). The combined prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia of staff backing Hubei reached as high as 38%. Four-class latent class analysis showed 3 categories of population (69.4%) may need psychological support. High prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia exist in medical staff related to COVID-19. The higher the probability and intensity of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the greater the risk that medical staff will suffer from mental disorders, suggesting continuous and proper psychiatric intervention are needed.","Wang, Zhang, Liu, Nan, Li, Xu, Xue, Zhang, Wang, Qu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.008","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Hospital; Medical staff; Psychological; Psychology; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (pÂ =Â .005) and anxiety (pÂ =Â .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents' activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.","El Haj, Altintas, Chapelet, Kapogiannis, Gallouj","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200902","Alzheimer's disease; Anxiety; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Depression; Mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Two-third of patients lacked adequate knowledge of precautionary measures against COVID-19. One out of five patients lacked knowledge of the mode of transmission and stopped their psychiatric treatment. Thirty percent showed features of relapse of symptoms during this lockdown period. In multivariate regression analysis, patients from lower socioeconomic status, low literacy levels, with inadequate social support showed less knowledge related to COVID-19.

A total of 612 volunteers between the ages of 18-38 enrolled in the study, 418 of them were athletes engaged in team sports or individual sports and 194 of them were non-athletes. Participants completed the Depression - Anxiety - Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21), the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and International Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ).

Although fear appears to be a major contributing factor, there has been no systematic research to determine which specific facets of fear predict psychopathology during the coronavirus crisis. The present study is the first to examine which fear factors uniquely predict clinical levels of depressive symptoms and generalized anxiety. Data were collected from 256 adults in the United States recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) during the coronavirus pandemic. The results from logistic regression analyses demonstrated that neuroticism, coronaphobia, and hypochondriasis were fear factors that predicted pandemic-related psychopathology in adults.

"Patient experiences of fertility clinic closure during the COVID-19 pandemic: appraisals, coping and emotions","What are appraisals, coping strategies and emotional reactions of patients to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) fertility clinic closures? Clinic closure was appraised as stressful due to uncertainty and threat to the attainability of the parenthood goal but patients were able to cope using strategies that fit the uncertainty of the situation. Psychological research on COVID-19 suggests that people are more anxious than historical norms and moderately to extremely upset about fertility treatment cancellation owing to COVID-19. The study was of cross-sectional design, comprising a mixed-methods, English language, anonymous, online survey posted from April 09 to April 21 to social media. Eligibility criteria were being affected by COVID-19 fertility clinic closure, 18 years of age or older and able to complete the survey in English. In total, 946 people clicked on the survey link, 76 did not consent, 420 started but did not complete survey, and 450 completed (48% completion, 446 women, four men). Overall 74.7% (nâ€‰=â€‰336) of respondents were residents in the UK with an average age of 33.6 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰4.4) and average years trying to conceive, 3.5 years (SDâ€‰=â€‰2.22). The survey comprised quantitative questions about the intensity of cognitive appraisals and emotions about clinic closure, and ability to cope with clinic closure. Open-text questions covered their understanding of COVID-19 and its effect on reproductive health and fertility plans, concerns and perceived benefits of clinic closure, and knowledge about closure. Sociodemographic information was collected. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used on quantitative data. Thematic qualitative analysis (inductive coding) was performed on the textual data from each question. Deductive coding grouped themes from each question into meta-themes related to cognitive stress and coping theory. Most patients (81.6%, nâ€‰=â€‰367) had tests or treatments postponed, with these being self (41.3%, nâ€‰=â€‰186) or publicly (46.4%, nâ€‰=â€‰209) funded. Patients appraised fertility clinic closure as having potential for a more negative than positive impact on their lives, and to be very or extremely uncontrollable and stressful (p â‰¤ .001). Most reported a slight to moderate ability to cope with closure. Data saturation was achieved with all open-text questions, with 33 broad themes identified and four meta-themes linked to components of the cognitive stress and coping theory. First, participants understood clinic closure was precautionary due to unknown effects of COVID-19 but some felt clinic closure was unfair relative to advice about getting pregnant given to the public. Second, closure was appraised as a threat to attainability of the parenthood goal largely due to uncertainty of the situation (e.g., re-opening, effect of delay) and intensification of pre-existing hardships of fertility problems (e.g., long time waiting for treatment, history of failed treatment). Third, closure taxed personal coping resources but most were able to cope using thought-management (e.g., distraction, focusing on positives), getting mentally and physically fit for next treatments, strengthening their social network, and keeping up-to-date. Finally, participants reported more negative than positive emotions (pâ€‰â‰¤â€‰ .001) and almost all participants reported stress, worry and frustration at the situation, while some expressed anger and resentment at the unfairness of the situation. Overall, 11.9% were not at all able to cope, with reports of intense feelings of hopelessness and deteriorating wellbeing and mental health. The survey captures patient reactions at a specific point in time, during lockdown and before clinics announced re-opening. Participants were self-selected (e.g., UK residents, women, 48% starting but not completing the survey), which may affect generalisability. Fertility stakeholders (e.g., clinics, patient support groups, regulators, professional societies) need to work together to address the great uncertainty from COVID-19. This goal can be met proactively by setting up transparent processes for COVID-19 eventualities and signposting to information and coping resources. Future psychological research priorities should be on identifying patients at risk of distress with standardised measures and developing digital technologies appropriate for the realities of fertility care under COVID-19.

"An overview of the expert consensus on the mental health treatment and services for major psychiatric disorders during COVID-19 outbreak: China's experiences","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China has presented substantial challenges to traditional forms of mental health service delivery. This review summarizes the expert consensus on the mental health treatment and services for severe psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 outbreak developed by the Chinese Society of Psychiatry and other academic associations. The Expert Recommendations on Managing Patients with Mental Disorders during a Serious Infectious Disease Outbreak (COVID-19) outline the appropriate measures for psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric units in general hospitals, including the delivery of outpatient, inpatient, and community mental health services. The Expert Recommendations on Internet and Telehealth in Psychiatry during Major Public Health Crises (COVID-19) describe the assessment and treatment issues of internet-based mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. The expert consensus recommendations provide guidance for mental health professionals in managing psychiatric services during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The experiences from China in addressing the challenges in the management of major psychiatric disorders may be useful and relevant to other countries who are combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Xiang, Zhao, Zhao, Liu, Zhang, Feng, Yan, Cheung, Ng","https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.47419","20200824","COVID-19; China; Expert consensus; major psychiatric disorders; online mental health service; Betacoronavirus; China; Community Mental Health Services; Consensus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Inpatients; Internet; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Outpatients; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Informed Consent for Emergency Obstetric Care During COVID-19 Pandemic","Informed consent process has become a challenging issue before surgery for any emergency obstetric care during this COVID pandemic. There is an increased risk of morbidity if there is a need of intensive care unit postoperatively and a risk of high mortality if patient has symptoms of COVID-19. Admission to intensive care unit adds on to the financial burden to the patient. Also, there is an increased risk of perinatal anxiety and depression during the COVID pandemic. When an asymptomatic carrier develops symptoms of COVID after delivery or caesarean section, the morbidity increases. So we have designed an informed consent form for patients undergoing emergency obstetric surgeries incorporating some points specific for COVID-19.","Tripathy, Mohapatra","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13224-020-01339-z","20200808","COVID-19; Informed consent; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Exposure to COVID-19 patients increases physician trainee stress and burnout","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put considerable physical and emotional strain on frontline healthcare workers. Among frontline healthcare workers, physician trainees represent a unique group-functioning simultaneously as both learners and caregivers and experiencing considerable challenges during the pandemic. However, we have a limited understanding regarding the emotional effects and vulnerability experienced by trainees during the pandemic. We investigated the effects of trainee exposure to patients being tested for COVID-19 on their depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment. All physician trainees at an academic medical center (n = 1375) were invited to participate in an online survey. We compared the measures of depression, anxiety, stress, burnout and professional fulfillment among trainees who were exposed to patients being tested for COVID-19 and those that were not, using univariable and multivariable models. We also evaluated perceived life stressors such as childcare, home schooling, personal finances and work-family balance among both groups. 393 trainees completed the survey (29% response rate). Compared to the non-exposed group, the exposed group had a higher prevalence of stress (29.4% vs. 18.9%), and burnout (46.3% vs. 33.7%). The exposed group also experienced moderate to extremely high perceived stress regarding childcare and had a lower work-family balance. Multivariable models indicated that trainees who were exposed to COVID-19 patients reported significantly higher stress (10.96 [95% CI, 9.65 to 12.46] vs 8.44 [95% CI, 7.3 to 9.76]; P = 0.043) and were more likely to be burned out (1.31 [95% CI, 1.21 to1.41] vs 1.07 [95% CI, 0.96 to 1.19]; P = 0.002]. We also found that female trainees were more likely to be stressed (P = 0.043); while unmarried trainees were more likely to be depressed (P = 0.009), and marginally more likely to have anxiety (P = 0.051). To address these challenges, wellness programs should focus on sustaining current programs, develop new and targeted mental health resources that are widely accessible and devise strategies for creating awareness regarding these resources.","Kannampallil, Goss, Evanoff, Strickland, McAlister, Duncan","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237301","20200812","Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Internet; Linear Models; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Change in five-factor model personality traits during the acute phase of the coronavirus pandemic","The rapid spread of the coronavirus and the strategies to slow it have disrupted just about every aspect of our lives. Such disruption may be reflected in changes in psychological function. The present study used a pre-posttest design to test whether Five Factor Model personality traits changed with the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Participants (N = 2,137) were tested in early February 2020 and again during the President's 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, Neuroticism decreased across these six weeks, particularly the facets of Anxiety and Depression, and Conscientiousness did not change. Interestingly, there was some evidence that the rapid changes in the social context had changed the meaning of an item. Specifically, an item about going to work despite being sick was a good indicator of conscientiousness before COVID-19, but the interpretation of it changed with the pandemic. In sum, the unexpected small decline in Neuroticism suggests that, during the acute phase of the coronavirus outbreak, feelings of anxiety and distress may be attributed more to the pandemic than to one's personality.","Sutin, Luchetti, Aschwanden, Lee, Sesker, Strickhouser, Stephan, Terracciano","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0237056","20200812","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Consciousness; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroticism; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Factors Associated with Mental Health Results among Workers with Income Losses Exposed to COVID-19 in China","The outbreak and worldwide spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a high prevalence of mental health problems in China and other countries. This was a cross-sectional study conducted using an online survey and face-to-face interviews to assess mental health problems and the associated factors among Chinese citizens with income losses exposed to COVID-19. The degrees of the depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress symptoms of our participants were assessed using the Chinese versions of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Insomnia Severity Index-7 (ISI-7), and the revised 7-item Impact of Event Scale (IES-7) scales, respectively, which found that the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress caused by COVID-19 were 45.5%, 49.5%, 30.9%, and 68.1%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes among workers with income losses during COVID-19. Participants working in Hubei province with heavy income losses, especially pregnant women, were found to have a high risk of developing unfavorable mental health symptoms and may need psychological support or interventions.","Li, Lu, Hu, Huang, Lu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155627","20200821","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; distress; income losses; insomnia; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Income; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Barriers and facilitators to optimal supportive end-of-life palliative care in long-term care facilities: a qualitative descriptive study of community-based and specialist palliative care physicians' experiences, perceptions and perspectives","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted ongoing challenges to optimal supportive end-of-life care for adults living in long-term care (LTC) facilities. A supportive end-of-life care approach emphasises family involvement, optimal symptom control, multidisciplinary team collaboration and death and bereavement support services for residents and families. Community-based and palliative care specialist physicians who visit residents in LTC facilities play an important role in supportive end-of-life care. Yet, perspectives, experiences and perceptions of these physicians remain unknown. The objective of this study was to explore barriers and facilitators to optimal supportive end-of-life palliative care in LTC through the experiences and perceptions of community-based and palliative specialist physicians who visit LTC facilities. Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews, basic qualitative description and directed content analysis using the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) theoretical framework. Residential long-term care. 23 physicians who visit LTC facilities from across Alberta, Canada, including both in urban and rural settings of whom 18 were community-based physicians and 5 were specialist palliative care physicians. Motivation barriers include families' lack of frailty knowledge, unrealistic expectations and emotional reactions to grief and uncertainty. Capability barriers include lack of symptom assessment tools, as well as palliative care knowledge, training and mentorship. Physical and social design barriers include lack of dedicated spaces for death and bereavement, inadequate staff, and mental health and spiritual services of insufficient scope for the population. Findings reveal that validating families' concerns, having appropriate symptom assessment tools, providing mentorship in palliative care and adapting the physical and social environment to support dying and grieving with dignity facilitates supportive, end-of-life care within LTC.","Harasym, Brisbin, Afzaal, Sinnarajah, Venturato, Quail, Kaasalainen, Straus, Sussman, Virk, Holroyd-Leduc","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-037466","20200818","adult palliative care; geriatric medicine; qualitative research; Adult; Aged; Alberta; Attitude of Health Personnel; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Female; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Health Services Needs and Demand; Hospice Care; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Palliative Care; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Qualitative Research; Respect; Skilled Nursing Facilities; Specialization; Terminal Care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Lifestyle Behaviors and Their Association With Subjective Well-Being Among the General Population in Mainland China: Cross-Sectional Study","The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is unclear whether people's lifestyles will change as a result. The aim of this study is to explore perceived lifestyle changes after the outbreak of COVID-19 and their association with subjective well-being (SWB) among the general population in Mainland China. An online survey was conducted in May 2020. Lifestyle behaviors including leisure-time physical exercise, leisure-time screen time, and dietary intake were self-reported. SWB was measured using the General Wellbeing Schedule (GWS). Other covariates including sociodemographic factors, self-rated physical health, perceived social support, and loneliness were also assessed by a structured questionnaire. A multivariate ordinal regression method was used to analyze the association between SWB and lifestyle behaviors as well as perceived lifestyle changes. A total of 1033 participants aged between 18 and 60 years were included in this study. The mean GWS score was 71.7 points. About 70% of the respondents reported spending more time looking at screens, whereas about 30% reported an increased frequency of vegetable and fruit intake after the outbreak of COVID-19. Inactive physical exercise (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.48), infrequent vegetable intake (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), infrequent fruit intake (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), and often skipping breakfast (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08-1.91) were associated with lower SWB after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, self-rated physical health, perceived social support, and loneliness. Moreover, participants who perceived a decrease in the frequency of vegetable, fruit, and breakfast intake were more likely to report lower SWB. The COVID-19 pandemic may have positive and negative impacts on different aspects of lifestyle behaviors. Both unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and negative lifestyle changes were associated with lower SWB. These findings provide scientific evidence that can inform lifestyle guidelines and public mental health interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Hu, Lin, Chiwanda Kaminga, Xu","https://doi.org/10.2196/21176","20200901","COVID-19; coronavirus disease; lifestyle behaviors; subjective well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in response to COVID-19: A study of the general population in China at the peak of its epidemic","Psychological resilience is characterized as the ability to respond to extreme stress or trauma or adverse experience successfully. While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized Î²Â =Â -0.490, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), anxiety (standardized Î²Â =Â -0.443, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized Î²Â =Â -0.358, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized Î²Â =Â -0.256, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001; standardized Î²Â =Â -0.217, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), anxiety (standardized Î²Â =Â -0.268, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001; standardized Î²Â =Â -0.147, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized Î²Â =Â -0.236, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001; standardized Î²Â =Â -0.126, PÂ &lt;Â 0.01). Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience. Psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention in a public health emergency.","Ran, Wang, Ai, Kong, Chen, Kuang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113261","20200903","Anxiety; China; Coronavirus disease 2019; Depression; Epidemic; Mental health; Psychological resilience; Somatization symptoms","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Anxiety and hopelessness levels in COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative study of healthcare professionals and other community sample in Turkey","COVID-19 affected our mental health as well as our physical health. In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic. An important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by ensuring that psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups are planned in advance.","Hacimusalar, Kahve, Yasar, Aydin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Hopelessness; Mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults without a pre-existing mental health condition: Findings from American trend panel survey","Most individuals in the United States have no history of a mental health condition yet are at risk for psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19-24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3Â days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery.","Holingue, Badillo-Goicoechea, Riehm, Veldhuis, Thrul, Johnson, Fallin, Kreuter, Stuart, Kalb","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106231","20200901","COVID-19; Epidemiology; Pandemic; Psychological distress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Crowdsourced smartphone data reveal altered sleep/wake pattern in quarantined Chinese during the COVID-19 outbreak","The Chinese Government quarantined Wuhan on 23 January 2020 and thereafter the Hubei province, affecting a total of 59 million citizens, to cease the spread of the coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19). The effects of this lockdown on the psychological and mental health of both the affected and unaffected Chinese are largely unknown currently. We utilized one of the largest crowdsourced databases (Sleep as Android) that consisted of 15,681 sleep records from 563 users in China to estimate the change in the sleep pattern of Chinese users during the span of 30 December 2019 to 8 March 2020 with reference to 64,378 sleep records of 1,628 users for the same calendar period of years 2011-2019. The sleep pattern in China changed drastically after 23 January 2020 when the law of quarantine and suspension of Wuhan became effective. The two major findings are: (1) Chinese people increased their sleep duration by an average of 20Â min and delayed their sleep onset by an average of 30 min at weekdays, while they maintained a similar sleep duration at weekends, and (2) larger changes were found in several subgroups, including those in Wuhan (80 sleep records from 3 users), female subjects, and those aged â‰¤ 24Â years.

"A cross-sectional study of mental health status and self-psychological adjustment in nurses who supported Wuhan for fighting against the COVID-19","To evaluate the mental health status, stressors and self-adjustment of nurses in isolation wards at different periods in Wuhan, China. Mental health issues easily occurred among the frontline medical workers of a major epidemic. However, the stressors and psychological adjustments experienced by nurses have not been well described. This is crucial to improving clinical quality and nursing safety and ensuring nurses' physical and psychological health. We performed a cross-sectional prospective study using the Self Reporting Questionnaire-20, stressor and self-adjustment questionnaire administered to frontline nurses in Wuhan at two time points: after they had worked in isolation wards for 7-10Â days (T<sub>1</sub> ) and 2Â months (T<sub>2</sub> ). This paper complies with the STROBE reporting guideline for cross-sectional studies. T<sub>1</sub> has 92 respondents, and T<sub>2</sub> has 86. The positive rates of mental health problems were 26.09% and 9.30%, respectively, showing significantly different in the two periods. The main factors influenced mental health were self-perceived stress and only child status. The most common stressors were as follows: a large infected population, high infectivity; concerned about family's health status; high mortality if not treated in time (T<sub>1</sub> ); and long duration of the epidemic, separate from family for a long time (T<sub>2</sub> ). In terms of self-adjustment, 97.83%(T<sub>1</sub> )/88.04%(T<sub>2</sub> ) of nurses thought it was necessary, but 9(T<sub>1</sub> ) /5(T<sub>2</sub> ) chose to avoid addressing it, and 8(T<sub>1</sub> ) /5(T<sub>2</sub> ) utilised a professional psychological counselling hotline. Mental health problems among frontline nurses fighting COVID-19 need special attention, so administrators should offer timely counselling and strengthen effective psychosocial support to improve their mental resilience. This study surveyed the mental problems and self-adjustment status among nurses working Wuhan during the outbreak of COVID-19, to provide administrators with a scientific basis to effectively intervene.","Chen, Sun, Du, Zhao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15444","20200902","COVID-19; Clinical; Infection Control; Mental Health; Novel coronavirus; Nurses; Psychological Adaptation; Psychological and Social Coping; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

An online survey of labor and delivery health care workers assessed job satisfaction and job-related anxiety before and during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as employees' subjective experience with universal testing. Patient and employee responses were analyzed for recurring themes. â€ƒA total of 318 asymptomatic women underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing during this 2-week period. Six of the eight women (75%) who tested positive reported negative in-hospital experiences secondary to perceived lack of provider and partner support and neonatal separation after birth. Among the 310 women who tested negative, 34.4% of multiparous women reported increased postpartum anxiety compared with their prior deliveries due to concerns about infectious exposure in the hospital and lack of social support. Only 27.6% of women, tested negative, found their test result to be reassuring. Job satisfaction and job-related anxiety among health care workers were negatively affected. Universal testing was viewed favorably by the majority of health care workers despite concerns about delays or alterations in patient care and maternal and neonatal separation. â€ƒUniversal testing for SARS-CoV-2 in obstetric units has mixed effects on maternal mental health but is viewed favorably by labor and delivery employees.

During a time of social isolation, economic loss, psychological distress, and reduced access to health services and support networks, all of which areÂ catalytic factors for both intentional injuries and heavy alcohol use, what is needed isÂ individualized and population-based preventive interventions aimed at reducing alcohol consumption, rather than decisions to increase certain forms of alcohol availability.","Lange, Probst, Rehm","https://doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00391-6","20200825","Alcohol availability; COVID-19; Heavy alcohol use; Intentional injuries; Interpersonal violence; Suicidal behaviour; Alcohol Drinking; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Intention; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Policy; Wounds and Injuries","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Temporal changes in psychobehavioural responses during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia","Monitoring public psychological and behavioural responses during the early phase of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is important for the management and control of infection. This study aims to investigate the temporal trend in (1) avoidance and protective behaviors, (2) fear, (3) socio-economic impact, and (4) anxiety levels during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a high level of anxiety may have a detrimental impact during an infectious disease outbreak, factors associated with anxiety were also explored. The survey was carried out for 10Â weeks and the responses were divided into three periods of around 3Â weeks: 25 January-21 February, 22 February-17 March and 18 March-3 April (the period the Malaysian Government issued Movement Control Order). Findings revealed that most of the pyschobehavioural variables showed small increases during first (25 January-21 February) and second (22 February-17 March) periods, and high psychobehavioral responses were reported during the third period. A total of 72.1% (95%CIâ€‰=â€‰69.2-75.0) reported moderate to severe anxiety as measured by the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Factor influencing moderate to severe anxiety is a high perception of severity (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.09; 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.48-2.94), high perceived susceptibility (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.71; 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.17-2.50), high impact score (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.63; 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.17-2.26) and high fear score (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.47; 95%CIâ€‰=â€‰1.01-2.14). In conclusion, the psychological and behavioural responses were found to increase with the progression of the outbreak. High anxiety levels found in this study warrant provision of mental health intervention during the early phase of COVID-19 outbreak.","Wong, Alias","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10865-020-00172-z","20200808","COVID-19; Malaysia; Psychobehavioural; SARS-CoV-2; Temporal changes","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Exacerbating Inequalities: Social Networks, Racial/Ethnic Disparities, and the COVID-19 Pandemic","The disruption and contraction of older adults' social networks are among the less-discussed consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective is to provide an evidence-based commentary on racial/ethnic disparities in social network resources and draw attention to the ways in which disasters differentially impact social networks, with meaningful insight for the ongoing pandemic. We draw upon prior research on social networks and past natural disasters to identify major areas of network inequality. Attention is given to how pre-pandemic racial/ethnic network disparities are exacerbated during the current crisis, with implications for physical and mental health outcomes. Evidence from the literature shows a robust association between strong social networks and physical and mental health outcomes. During times of crisis, access to social networks for older adults are disrupted, particularly for marginalized groups. We document pre-pandemic disparities in social networks resources and offer insight for examining the impact of COVID-19 on disrupting social networks among older adults. Importantly, racial/ethnic disparities in social networks both prior to and as a result of the pandemic intensify existing inequalities and demonstrate the necessity of better understanding social network inequalities for marginalized older adults, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 health crisis.","Gauthier, Smith, GarcÃ­a, Garcia, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa117","20200903","COVID-19; Racial and Ethnic Minorities; Social Networks","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic: A study among Dutch older adults","With the spread of COVID-19, the Netherlands implemented a policy to keep citizens physically distanced. We hypothesize that consequent reduction in the frequency of social contacts, personal losses and the experience of general threats in society reduced well-being. Data were collected from 1,679 Dutch community-dwelling participants aged 65 to 102 years old comprising a longitudinal online panel. Social and emotional loneliness and mental health were measured in May 2020, i.e., two months after the implementation of the measures, and earlier in October and November 2019. In this pandemic, not only loneliness of older people increased, but mental health remained roughly stable. The policy measures for physical distancing did not cause much social isolation but personal losses, worries about the pandemic, and a decline in trust in societal institutions were associated with increased mental health problems and especially emotional loneliness. The consequences of long-term social isolation and well-being must be closely monitored.","van Tilburg, Steinmetz, Stolte, van der Roest, de Vries","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa111","20200901",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Strategy for the Practice of Spine Oncological Surgery During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Case series. For each of the most frequent clinical scenarios, the authors reached a consensus on how should be timing and indications be optimized to reduce risk while maintaining the expected outcomes under the COVID 19 pandemics. The organization of healthcare has been changed by the Covid-19 pandemic with a direct impact on Spine Oncology Surgery. Emergency surgery is still a priority, but in case of Spinal Tumors it should be better defined which conditions require emergency treatment. An expert panel with general spine surgeons, oncological spine surgeons and radiation oncologists was formed to analize the most frequent scenarios in spinal musculoskeletal oncology during COVID 19 pandemics. Spine Metastases can be found incidentally during follow-up or can clinically occur by increasing pain, pathologic fracture and/or neurological symptoms. Primary Spine Tumors are much more rare and very rarely present with acute onset. The first step is to suspect this rare condition, in order to avoid to treat a primary tumor as it were a metastasis. Most complex surgery, like enbloc resection, associated with high morbidity and mortality rate for the treatment of low grade malignancy like Chordoma or Chondrosarcomas, if Intensive Care Unit availability is reduced, can be best delayed some weeks, as not impacting on prognosis, due to the slow growth rate of these conditions. The currently accepted protocols for Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) and Osteogenic Sarcoma (OGS) must be performed for local and systemic disease control. For ES, after the first courses of Chemotherapy, Radiotherapy can be selected instead of surgery, during Covid-19, to the end of the full course of chemotherapy. When delaying surgery (chemotherapy completed or toxicity), is essential to avoid contact between immune depressed and Covid-19 patients, during the hospital stay for surgery. Even more than during normal times, a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to share the decision to modify a treatment strategy. 5.","Berjano, Vanni, Fariselli, Cecchinato, Boriani","https://doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000003623","20200806",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Comparing eating behaviours, and symptoms of depression and anxiety between Spain and Greece during the COVID-19 outbreak: Cross-sectional analysis of two different confinement strategies","We compared eating behaviours, and depressive and anxiety symptoms in two countries with different confinement strictness strategies and different levels of COVID-19 pandemic. A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered during and shortly after the COVID-19 related lockdown in Spain and Greece. Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify country differences associated with eating behaviour, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. This study included 1,002 responders in Spain and 839 in Greece. The meanâ€‰Â±â€‰SD of restraint, emotional and external eating was 2.5â€‰Â±â€‰0.79, 2.1â€‰Â±â€‰0.81 and 2.6â€‰Â±â€‰0.65 in Spain, whereas 2.7â€‰Â±â€‰0.85, 2.3â€‰Â±â€‰0.99 and 2.9â€‰Â±â€‰0.74 in Greece. Spanish participants had lower average scores of restraint and external eating compared to Greek participants (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), but no difference was seen for emotional eating. In Spain, 13.6%, and 12.3% of the survey respondents reported moderate to severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, whereas in Greece the respective values were 18.8 and 13.2%. After adjusting for several risk factors, a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms was observed in Spain compared to Greece (p = .001), but no difference was seen for depressive symptoms. This study demonstrated high scores of inappropriate eating behaviours and a high frequency of depressive and anxiety symptoms in two Mediterranean countries during the COVID-19 outbreak. Our findings revealed that compared to Greek participants, Spanish participants, that faced more severe COVID-19 pandemic and stricter lockdown measures, were associated with lower restraint and external eating and increased anxiety symptoms, but not with depressive symptoms or emotional eating.","Papandreou, Arija, Aretouli, Tsilidis, BullÃ³","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2772","20200821","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; eating behaviour","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological Distress in Outpatients With Lymphoma During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Cancer patients are a population at high risk of contracting COVID-19 and, also of developing severe complications due to the infection, which is especially true when they are undergoing immunosuppressive treatment. Despite this, they had still to go to hospital to receive chemotherapy during lockdown. In this context, we have evaluated the psychological status of onco-hematological outpatients receiving infusion and not deferrable anti-neoplastic treatment for lymphoproliferative neoplasms, with the aim of both measuring the levels of post-traumatic symptoms, depression, and anxiety during the pandemic and also of investigating the perception of risk of potential nosocomial infection. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were administered to all patients. Moreover, patients were investigated about their worries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on their lives as onco-hematologic patients. Since the 2nd to the 29th April 2020 (during the first phase of the lockdown period in Italy), 77 outpatients were prospectively evaluated. They were diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/Small lymphocytic lymphoma. The mean age was 56.6 (range 22-85). We found that 36% of patients had anxiety (HADS-A), 31% depression (HADS-D), and 43% were above the cut-off for the HADS-General Scale; 36% fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Women and younger patients were found to be more vulnerable to anxiety and PTSD. The study firstly analyzes the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the frail population of patients affected by lymphoproliferative neoplasms, to underly the importance of screening patients for emotional and distress conditions and then offering them psychological support.","Romito, Dellino, Loseto, Opinto, Silvestris, Cormio, Guarini, Minoia","https://doi.org/10.3389/fonc.2020.01270","20200806","COVID-19; cancer; lymphoma; post-traumatic stress symptoms; psychological distress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The COVID-19 Pandemic and Planetary Health A Critical Review of Epidemiology, Prevention, Clinical Characteristics and Treatments for Oral, Head and Neck Health Professionals Do We Have a Roadmap?","<b>Introduction</b> â€ƒCoronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is potentially the greatest global public health crisis of this century. This disease emerged as an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, the capital city of the Hubei province in China, in December 2019. Otolaryngologists, head and neck surgeons and dentists are at an increased risk of occupational disease. <b>Objective</b> â€ƒThe present review summarizes currently published evidence of Covid-19 epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment and prevention. No proven effective treatments for this disease currently exist. <b>Data Synthesis</b> â€ƒCOVID-19 started from a zoonotic transmission event associated with a large seafood market that also traded in live wild animals, and it soon became clear that efficient person-to-person transmission was also occurring. Symptoms are varied, and not all patients develop all of them. <b>Conclusion</b> â€ƒSocial distancing seems to have been successful in several places in the world. However, this recommendation alone is not enough to contain the disease, and it is not a long-term solution. Large-scale testing by health professionals of representative samples of the population may give an estimate of the progression of the disease. Different treatments are under test and bring hope of a cure to the population. However, no current treatments (April 27, 2020) have been proven to be the key to success in the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Planetary health is a useful concept to understand the current drivers of this pandemic and to draw a roadmap for science and healthcare that may guide actions to fight economic depression and ensure a healthy recovery.","Jotz, Stein, Sirena, Barros, Baldisserotto, Figueiredo, Lavinsky, Steier, Dora","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1714143","20200829","COVID-19; clinical characteristics; epidemiology; planetary health; prevention; treatment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Outbreak on Health Professionals: A Cross-Sectional Study","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic had a massive impact on health care systems, increasing the risks of psychological distress in health professionals. This study aims at assessing the prevalence of burnout and psychopathological conditions in health professionals working in a health institution in the Northern Italy, and to identify socio-demographic, work-related and psychological predictors of burnout. <b>Methods:</b> Health professionals working in the hospitals of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano were asked to participate to an online anonymous survey investigating socio-demographic data, COVID-19 emergency-related work and psychological factors, state anxiety, psychological distress, post-traumatic symptoms and burnout. Predictors of the three components of burnout were assessed using elastic net regression models. <b>Results:</b> Three hundred and thirty health professionals participated to the online survey. Two hundred and thirty-five health professionals (71.2%) had scores of state anxiety above the clinical cutoff, 88 (26.8%) had clinical levels of depression, 103 (31.3%) of anxiety, 113 (34.3%) of stress, 121 (36.7%) of post-traumatic stress. Regarding burnout, 107 (35.7%) had moderate and 105 (31.9%) severe levels of emotional exhaustion; 46 (14.0%) had moderate and 40 (12.1%) severe levels of depersonalization; 132 (40.1%) had moderate and 113 (34.3%) severe levels of reduced personal accomplishment. Predictors of all the three components of burnout were work hours, psychological comorbidities, fear of infection and perceived support by friends. Predictors of both emotional exhaustion and depersonalization were female gender, being a nurse, working in the hospital, being in contact with COVID-19 patients. Reduced personal accomplishment was also predicted by age. <b>Conclusions:</b> Health professionals had high levels of burnout and psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 emergency. Monitoring and timely treatment of these conditions is needed.","Giusti, Pedroli, D'Aniello, Stramba Badiale, Pietrabissa, Manna, Stramba Badiale, Riva, Castelnuovo, Molinari","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01684","20200806","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; clinical psychology; cross-sectional study; depression; post-traumatic stress; predictors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Rethinking 'essential' and 'nonessential': the developmental paediatrician's COVID-19 response","While terms such as 'essential' and 'nonessential' used amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may serve a practical purpose, they also pose a risk of obstructing our view of the harmful indirect health consequences of this crisis. SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other 'essential' aspects of children's health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as 'essential' during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now.

The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the levels of social support and mental health among Chinese adolescents during the outbreak. A total of 7,202 adolescents aged 14-18 years completed online survceys from March 8 to 15, 2020, in China. Researchers assessed the associations between depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and social support (Social Support Rate Scale). COVID-19 exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR]Â = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14-1.66) and anxiety symptoms (ORÂ = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.52). Only 24.6% of adolescents reported high levels of social support. Most adolescents (70%) reported medium levels of support, and 5.4% reported low support. Low support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (ORÂ = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.38-5.33) and anxiety symptoms (ORÂ = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.54-3.98), while controlling for gender, grade, living situation, and COVID-19 exposure; similarly, medium support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (ORÂ = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.48-3.15) and anxiety (ORÂ = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94-2.48) symptoms.

"Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups","To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 Â± 18.9, 47.3 Â± 13.1, and 43.2 Â± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Hu, Ekumi, Wang, An, Li, Yuan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003","20200808","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; older age; psychological distress; stress response; survivors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This study aims to examine individuals' perception of health conditions and test availability as potential predictors of mental health-insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress-during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 669 adults in Malaysia was conducted during 2-8 May 2020, six weeks after the Movement Control Order (MCO) was issued. We found adults' perception of health conditions had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and distress. Perceived test availability for COVID-19 also had curvilinear relationships (horizontally reversed J-shaped) with anxiety and depression. Younger adults reported worse mental health, but people from various religions and ethnic groups did not differ significantly in reported mental health. The results indicated that adults with worse health conditions had more mental health problems, and the worse degree deepened for unhealthy people.

"The COVID-19 pandemic and patients with endometriosis: A survey-based study conducted in Turkey","To apply rapid online surveying to determine the knowledge and perceptions of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with endometriosis in Turkey. An online survey was conducted by the Turkish Endometriosis &amp; Adenomyosis Society and administered to patients with endometriosis who agreed to participate in the study. The survey included 25 questions prepared by an expert committee of four professionals (two gynecologists and two endometriosis specialists). Of the 290 questionnaires sent out, 261 (90%) were returned. A total of 213 (83.86%) patients reported that they were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. In addition, 133 (53.63%) patients thought the management of their endometriosis was affected because of the pandemic. Clinical studies clearly indicate that endometriosis is a condition associated with high levels of chronic stress. The COVID-19 pandemic has led the public to experience psychological problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, psychological distress, depression, and anxiety. The majority of patients with endometriosis were afraid of having endometriosis-related problems during the pandemic period. The majority of elective endometriosis surgeries have not been postponed. Patients were highly aware of the pandemic and practiced social distancing and hygiene. Only 4 (1.59%) patients with endometriosis required hospitalization.","YalÃ§Ä±n Bahat, Kaya, SelÃ§uki, Polat, Usta, Oral","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13339","20200901","COVID-19; OB/GYN; Pandemic; Physician; Stress; Survey","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: Early outpatient experiences and implications for the future","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U.S. healthcare landscape. Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact. In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19. We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual. Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Notable benefits have included robust clinical volumes despite social distancing mandates, reduced logistical barrieres to care for many patients, and decreased no-show rates. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.","Chen, Chung, Young, Tuttle, Collins, Darghouth, Longley, Levy, Razafsha, Kerner, Wozniak, Huffman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002","20200903","Coronavirus/COVID-19; Mental health care/service delivery systems; Outpatient psychiatry; Quality improvement; Telepsychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Covid-19-Beyond virology: Potentials for maintaining mental health during lockdown","The current study aimed to assess prevalence of mental disorders during Covid-19 pandemic- and respective lockdown in Germany, and potential behaviors/states that can have protective functions on preventing severe mental problems. Assessing prevalence of mental disorders, as well as to find potential protective variables is very important in order to determine people's psychological suffering. It provides the basis for teaching possible coping styles in order to prevent a major breakdown on mental health. Prevalence on mental disorders was expected to increase during the pandemic, especially depression, (general-/and health-) anxiety, panic attacks- and disorder, as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder. Additionally, potentially protective variables, such as resilience and coping, were included. N = 949 subjects completed an online-survey that asked for symptoms regarding depression, (health) anxiety, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and lock-down related behavior-starting 14 days after lockdown in Germany. Prevalence of mental disorders in the current sample was much higher than usual prevalence of mental disorders, with 50.6% expressing at least one mental disorder. Resilience was associated with lower risks for any mental disorder (OR = 4.23, p &lt; .0001, 95%CI = 3.21-5.57), as well as with any other measured mental illness (all ORs between = 2.82 for obsessive-compulsive disorder and OR = 41.44 for panic disorder, all p &lt; .001). Similar results were obtained regarding coping (focus on positive). Results are highly relevant in order to provide a glance on what substantial influence the current pandemic- and lockdown situation has on mental health across the country, and possibly across the world. Possible ways in order to prevent deterioration and help coping with the current situation are being elaborated and discussed.","Munk, Schmidt, Alexander, Henkel, Hennig","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236688","20200812","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Germany; Humans; Internet; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder; Odds Ratio; Pandemics; Panic Disorder; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Closing the COVID-19 Psychological Treatment Gap for Cancer Patients in Alberta: Protocol for the Implementation and Evaluation of Text4Hope-Cancer Care","Cancer diagnoses and treatments usually engender significant anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients, close relatives, and caregivers. Providing psychological support during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents additional challenges due to self-isolation and social or physical distancing measures in place to limit viral spread. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (Text4Hope-Cancer Care) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. As demonstrated in previous research, this evidence-based program supports good outcomes and high user satisfaction. We will implement daily supportive text messaging as a way of reducing and managing anxiety and depression related to cancer diagnosis and treatment in Alberta, Canada. Prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, their demographic correlates, and Text4Hope-Cancer Care-induced changes in anxiety and depression will be evaluated. Alberta residents with a cancer diagnosis and the close relatives of those dealing with a cancer diagnosis can self-subscribe to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program by texting &quot;CancerCare&quot; to a dedicated text number. Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Data will be collected at onset from individuals receiving text messages, and at the mid- and endpoints of the program (ie, at 6 and 12 weeks, respectively). Data will be analyzed with parametric and nonparametric statistics for primary outcomes (ie, anxiety and depressive symptoms) and usage metrics, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. In addition, data mining and machine learning analysis will focus on determining subscriber characteristics that predict high levels of symptoms of mental disorders, and may subsequently predict changes in those measures in response to the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program. The first research stage, which was completed in April 2020, involved the creation and review of the supportive text messages and uploading of messages into a web-based text messaging service. The second stage, involving the launch of the Text4Hope-Cancer Care program, occurred in May 2020. Text4Hope-Cancer Care has the potential to provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of anxiety and depressive symptoms in patients diagnosed or receiving care for cancer and their caregivers. The study will generate demographic correlates of anxiety and depression, and outcome data related to this scalable, population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for health care practitioners working in cancer care and may help inform policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions for cancer care.

"What Factors Increase the Risk of Complications in SARS-CoV-2-Infected Patients? A Cohort Study in a Nationwide Israeli Health Organization","Reliably identifying patients at increased risk for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complications could guide clinical decisions, public health policies, and preparedness efforts. Multiple studies have attempted to characterize at-risk patients, using various data sources and methodologies. Most of these studies, however, explored condition-specific patient cohorts (eg, hospitalized patients) or had limited access to patients' medical history, thus, investigating related questions and, potentially, obtaining biased results. This study aimed to identify factors associated with COVID-19 complications from the complete medical records of a nationally representative cohort of patients, with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We studied a cohort of all SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, confirmed by polymerase chain reaction testing of either nasopharyngeal or saliva samples, in a nationwide health organization (covering 2.3 million individuals) and identified those who suffered from serious complications (ie, experienced moderate or severe symptoms of COVID-19, admitted to the intensive care unit, or died). We then compared the prevalence of pre-existing conditions, extracted from electronic health records, between complicated and noncomplicated COVID-19 patient cohorts to identify the conditions that significantly increase the risk of disease complications, in various age and sex strata. Of the 4353 SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals, 173 (4%) patients suffered from COVID-19 complications (all age â‰¥18 years). Our analysis suggests that cardiovascular and kidney diseases, obesity, and hypertension are significant risk factors for COVID-19 complications. It also indicates that depression (eg, males â‰¥65 years: odds ratio [OR] 2.94, 95% CI 1.55-5.58; P=.01) as well as cognitive and neurological disorders (eg, individuals â‰¥65 years old: OR 2.65, 95% CI 1.69-4.17; P&lt;.001) are significant risk factors. Smoking and presence of respiratory diseases do not significantly increase the risk of complications. Our analysis agrees with previous studies on multiple risk factors, including hypertension and obesity. It also finds depression as well as cognitive and neurological disorders, but not smoking and respiratory diseases, to be significantly associated with COVID-19 complications. Adjusting existing risk definitions following these observations may improve their accuracy and impact the global pandemic containment and recovery efforts.","Yanover, Mizrahi, Kalkstein, Marcus, Akiva, Barer, Shalev, Chodick","https://doi.org/10.2196/20872","20200902","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; complications; risk factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"[Suicidality in adults]","Suicide rates appear to be influenced by the economy. In the Netherlands, fluctuation in these rates in the last 10 years was mainly seen in men. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a negative impact on this fluctuation. There are no reliable predictors of suicidality yet, but there are developments that could lead to better predictions. Examples include 'big data' and 'machine learning' in combination with a network approach in which psychopathology is seen as a complex dynamic system. Better differentiation of suicidality can help clinical practice to offer tailored treatment and prevention. Suicidality is a multifactorial and complex phenomenon that goes beyond mental healthcare. In recent years, various prevention strategies and lines of research have been launched that focus on this complexity, making suicidality easier to treat and understand.

"Initial Challenges of Caregiving During COVID-19: Caregiver Burden, Mental Health, and the Parent-Child Relationship","Research confirms that the mental health burdens following community-wide disasters are extensive, with pervasive impacts noted in individuals and families. It is clear that child disaster outcomes are worst among children of highly distressed caregivers, or those caregivers who experience their own negative mental health outcomes from the disaster. The current study used path analysis to examine concurrent patterns of parents' (nâ€‰=â€‰420) experience from a national sample during the early months of the U.S. COVID-19 pandemic. The results of a multi-group path analysis, organized by parent gender, indicate good fit to the data [X<sup>2</sup>(10)â€‰=â€‰159.04, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.01]. Results indicate significant linkages between parents' caregiver burden, mental health, and perceptions of children's stress; these in turn are significantly linked to child-parent closeness and conflict, indicating possible spillover effects for depressed parents and compensatory effects for anxious parents. The impact of millions of families sheltering in place during the COVID-19 pandemic for an undefined period of time may lead to unprecedented impacts on individuals' mental health with unknown impacts on child-parent relationships. These impacts may be heightened for families whose caregivers experience increased mental health symptoms, as was the case for fathers in the current sample.","Russell, Hutchison, Tambling, Tomkunas, Horton","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-020-01037-x","20200807","Anxiety; COVID-19; Caregiver burden; Depression; Parentâ€“child relationship","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Conceptualizing COVID-19 and Public Panic with the Moderating Role of Media Use and Uncertainty in China: An Empirical Framework","Uncertainty puts people in a binary state of mind, where every piece of external information can positively or negatively affect their state of health. Given the uncertain situation created by the new coronavirus pandemic, this study claims to be the first empirical analysis of the real-time status of public panic in China. It frames peoples' intrinsic and extrinsic stimuli, creating a psychosocial analysis of public panic. We conducted an online survey of WeChat and QQ users in February 2020 and collected 1613 samples through a QR code questionnaire. We used the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression equation model to conceptualize public panic pathways in different gender and age groups. This underlines the psychological origins of fear and anxiety and points out how the media uses socially constructed public panic. The results show that the outbreak of COVID-19 created uncertainty among the public, and the official media intensified it because of the late dissemination of news about the outbreak's real-time status. Hence, unofficial media remained faster in news reporting, but the news reporting remained contradictory with official reports. This created doubts about the authenticity of the given information and caused public mental health abnormalities. The study provides a conceptual framework based on lessons learned from physiology, psychology, and social psychology and real-time public analysis to inform policymakers and public administrators about the contextual dynamics of public panic in China. It provides useful insights into the wise handling of this uncertain time and controlling the fatal conditions of public panic created by COVID-19. It has implications for other countries as well.","Xu, Sattar","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare8030249","20200804","anxiety; cognition; news reporting; novel coronavirus; psychosocial analysis; public health; stress management","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychosocial factors associated with symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder in general practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare providers commonly experience symptoms of anxiety during public health crises and pandemics. The objective of the study was to identify the frequency of symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) in general practitioners and to estimate the association with particular psychosocial and demographic factors. This is a cross-sectional study, where a total of 531 general practitioners completed an online form that contained sociodemographic variables, questions about fear and perceptions concerning medical work during the COVID-19 pandemic, 7-Item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), questionnaire on psychosomatic problems and Fear of COVID-19 Scale. The presence of symptoms of GAD was defined by a GAD-7 score of 10 or more points. Voluntary and anonymous participation, acceptance of terms, and informed consent were requested. A p value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Symptoms of GAD were identified in 4 out of 10 Colombian general practitioners; the following psychosocial and demographic factors were associated with a greater presence of these symptoms: female gender, social discrimination, anguish, job disappointment, nightmares, stress and other symptoms of fear regarding the pandemic. Conversely, feeling protected by the state or employer, being satisfied with their job as a physician, and trusting government measures and information were associated with a lower presence of symptoms of GAD. These findings highlight the importance of timely psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological interventions in these individuals. The authors suggest mental health providers should be deployed during times of crisis to decrease the risk of developing mental illness.","Monterrosa-Castro, Redondo-Mendoza, Mercado-Lara","https://doi.org/10.1136/jim-2020-001456","20200807","anxiety; psychopathology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are suffering from increased rates of mental health disturbances. Residents' duty obligations put them at increased physical and mental health risk. It is only by prioritizing their well-being that we can better serve the patients and prepare for a surge. Therefore, it is imperative that measures are put in place to protect them. Resident wellness was optimized by targeting 3 domains: efficiency of practice, culture of wellness and personal resilience. Efficiency in delivering information and patient care minimizes additional stress to residents that is caused by the pandemic. By having a reserve team, prioritizing the safety of residents and taking burnout seriously, the culture of wellness and sense of community in our program are emphasized. All of the residents' personal resilience was further optimized by the regular and mandatory measures put in place by the program. The new challenges brought on by a pandemic puts increased pressure on residents. Measures must be put in place to protect resident from the increased physical and mental health stress in order to best serve patients during this difficult time.","Lie, Huynh, Scott, Karimuddin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2020.07.017","20200807","Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Pandemic; Patient Care; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; Professionalism; Resident education; Resident wellness; Surgical education; Systems-Based Practice; Well-being; Wellness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Prospective cohort study. Otolaryngology Clinic of the University Polyclinic A. Gemelli, IRCCS Foundation. All patients with voice prosthesis who underwent laryngectomy followed by our institute were offered enrollment. Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed to inquire about the nature of the need and to plan a video call with the appropriate clinician. Before and 1 week after the clinician's call, patients were tested with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Degrees of satisfaction were investigated with a visual analog scale. A comparison between those who accepted and refused telematic support was carried out to identify factors that influence patient interest in teleservice. Video call service allowed us to reach 37 (50.68%) of 73 patients. In 23 (62.16%) of 37 cases, the video call was sufficient to manage the problem. In the remaining 14 cases (37.83%), an outpatient visit was necessary.

Five hundred and fifteen adults aged 20-79 in the U.S. reported on their anxiety about developing COVID-19, proactive coping, and stress related to COVID-19 in an online survey. Although there were no age differences in stress levels, anxiety about developing COVID-19 was associated with more COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults, but proactive coping was associated with less COVID-19 stress for older adults relative to younger adults. Our results suggest that anxiety might function as a risk factor whereas proactive coping may function as a resilience factor for older adults' COVID-19 stress.

"&quot;Pandemonium of the pandemic&quot;: Impact of COVID-19 in India, focus on mental health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health threat, with every nation facing unique challenges during the outbreak. Such pandemics are much beyond biological phenomena. They have psychosocial and economic implications that might long outlast the infection itself. India recently crossed 50,000 cases and is undergoing a historic nationwide lockdown in an attempt to control the outbreak. Considering the sociocultural diversity, limited public health resources, increasing psychological comorbidities, and substantial number of vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, migrants), the subcontinent is facing unprecedented challenges at all fronts.

"Coping and tolerance of uncertainty: Predictors and mediators of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current pandemic wave of COVID-19 has resulted in significant uncertainty for the general public. Mental health and examining factors that may influence distress have been outlined as key research priorities to inform interventions. This research sought to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and coping responses influence the degree of distress experienced by the U.K. general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (<i>N</i> = 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early &quot;lockdown&quot; phase of the pandemic. Around a quarter of participants demonstrated significantly elevated anxiety and depression, with 14.8% reaching clinical cutoff for health anxiety. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated those in &quot;vulnerable&quot; groups were significantly more anxious (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), and also more anxious in relation to their health (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Mediation modeling demonstrated maladaptive coping responses partially mediated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress. Mental health difficulties have become significantly raised during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, particularly for the vulnerable. Findings support emerging research suggesting the general public is struggling with uncertainty, more so than normal. Vulnerable groups are more anxious about their health, but not more intolerant of uncertainty than the nonvulnerable. Finally, this study indicated two modifiable factors that could act as treatment targets when adapting interventions for mental health during the COVID-19 global health crisis.

"The impact of COVID-19 on doctors' well-being: results of a web survey during the lockdown in Italy","On March 12, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a new Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), to be a pandemic. From the beginning, Italy (in particular the Northern regions) was the first large European country to be hit and one of the most affected countries worldwide. This had a significant impact on the workload and psychological health of health workers. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study is to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on Italian doctors' well-being and psychological distress, in respect of demographic and occupational characteristics, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown period. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional survey based on GoogleÂ® Forms to collect data. The participation was available during the lockdown period that started in Italy on March 9, 2020 and it was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire explored demographic and occupational variables, lifestyle and habits during the lockdown, perceived well-being and psychological distress. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted. Our study reported the very alarming psychological conditions of Italian doctors, especially among those who worked in the most affected regions, where a level of psychological distress of 93.8% and poor well-being of 58.9% were registered. These percentages were even higher in the case of female hospital workers with low job seniority, and those caring for COVID-19 patients. Our findings reported a significant psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian doctors, particularly among those working in the most affected regions of the country. Further studies are necessary to better understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on doctors' well-being and mental health over time, in order to implement effective prevention measures.","De Sio, Buomprisco, La Torre, Lapteva, Perri, Greco, Mucci, Cedrone","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202007_22292","20200819","Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internet; Italy; Loneliness; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Quarantine; Smoking; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Dying to Belong: The Importance of Familiarity in Later Life","Despite the large amount of research into loneliness, the evidence base around effective ways of tackling loneliness among older adults is limited. Up to one-half of all older adults regularly feel lonely, negatively impacting physical and mental health. In light of population aging, family dispersal, and in the aftermath of COVID-19, it is vital that we grow the evidence base around the lived experience of older people, knowing what they want and why, and ensuring community services and supports are meaningful to them. <b>Method:</b> Three focus groups were held with community-dwelling older adults in Ireland. <b>Results:</b> Loneliness is associated with the loss of familiarity and connection to community. <b>Conclusions:</b> Understanding loneliness in later life is increasingly important with population aging. As plans for ending confinement linked to COVID-19 are devised, a mechanism is urgently needed to sustain the positive changes to communities which have meaningfully connected with older adults.","Carragher, Ryan","https://doi.org/10.1177/2333721420941976","20200804","COVID-19; connection and community; loneliness; older adults","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Role of Psychological First Aid to Support Public Mental Health in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Psychological first aid (PFA) is one of the vital tools in delivering psychological interventions to those who have undergone or experienced traumatic events. Traumatic experiences during calamities, outbreaks of infections, and war can induce a significant amount of stress in the absence of early and effective intervention provided by trained caregivers. The coronavirus pandemic has caused significant levels of fear as governments impose quarantine and lockdown to contain the infection. Countries around the globe have halted several social and economic operations to curb the spread of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). However, panic, helplessness, and horror aided by the infection due to the lack of a definitive cure has exposed the population to significant mental distress, thus warranting psychological intervention.","Shah, Bedi, Onyeaka, Singh, Chaudhari","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8821","20200804","coronavirus; covid-19; mental health; pfa; pfa efficacy; pfa models; pfa training; psychological first aid; rapid; telepsychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Roadmap to strengthen global mental health systems to tackle the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID pandemic has been devastating for not only its direct impact on lives, physical health, socio-economic status of individuals, but also for its impact on mental health. Some individuals are affected psychologically more severely and will need additional care. However, the current health system is so fragmented and focused on caring for those infected that management of mental illness has been neglected. An integrated approach is needed to strengthen the health system, service providers and research to not only manage the current mental health problems related to COVID but develop robust strategies to overcome more long-term impact of the pandemic. A series of recommendations are outlined in this paper to help policy makers, service providers and other stakeholders, and research and research funders to strengthen existing mental health systems, develop new ones, and at the same time advance research to mitigate the mental health impact of COVID19. The recommendations refer to low, middle and high resource settings as capabilities vary greatly between countries and within countries. The recommendations for policy makers are focused on strengthening leadership and governance, finance mechanisms, and developing programme and policies that especially include the most vulnerable populations. Service provision should focus on accessible and equitable evidence-based community care models commensurate with the existing mental health capacity to deliver care, train existing primary care staff to cater to increased mental health needs, implement prevention and promotion programmes tailored to local needs, and support civil societies and employers to address the increased burden of mental illness. Researchers and research funders should focus on research to develop robust information systems that can be enhanced further by linking with other data sources to run predictive models using artificial intelligence, understand neurobiological mechanisms and community-based interventions to address the pandemic driven mental health problems in an integrated manner and use innovative digital solutions. Urgent action is needed to strengthen mental health system in all settings. The recommendations outlined can be used as a guide to develop these further or identify new ones in relation to local needs.","Maulik, Thornicroft, Saxena","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00393-4","20200804","COVID 19; Mental health resources; Mental health services; Mental health systems; Policy making; Research","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Coronaviruses disease 2019 (COVID-19): Causative agent, mental health concerns, and potential management options","Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic started from Wuhan, China has infected more than 6.7 million individuals and killed more than 390,000 individuals globally. Due to the higher transmissibility and infectiousness, asymptomatic infection, and lack of effective treatment options and vaccine, fatalities and morbidities are increasing day by day globally. Despite physical health consequences, COVID-19 pandemic has created stress and anxiety, as result there is an increased risk of mental illnesses both in the infected and normal individuals. To eradicate these risks, it is necessary to determine the COVID-19 zoonotic source of transmission to humans and clinical manifestations in infected individuals. Although, identification or development of the highly effective therapeutic agents is necessary, however, development of protective strategies against the COVID-19 by enhancing immune responses will be an asset in the current scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we discuss the transmission, health consequences, and potential management (therapeutic and preventive) options for COVID-19 disease.","Khan, Siddique, Bai, Shabana, Liu, Xue, Nabi, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.07.010","20200806","COVID-19; Coronaviruses; Infectiousness; Transmission","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This study aimed to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among a representative sample of home-quarantined Bangladeshi adults. A cross-sectional design was used with an online survey completed by a convenience sample recruited via social media. A total of 1,427 respondents were recruited, and their mental health was assessed by the DASS-21 measure. The prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms was 33.7% and 57.9%, respectively, and 59.7% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Perceptions that the pandemic disrupted life events, affected mental health, jobs, the economy and education, predictions of a worsening situation, and uncertainty of the health care system capacities were significantly associated with poor mental health outcomes. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that sociodemographic factors and perceptions of COVID-19 significantly predict mental health outcomes.

"Safer opioid distribution in response to the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has turned the world upside down in a very short period of time. The impact of COVID-19 will disproportionately effect people who are least able to protect themselves and this will include people who use drugs. The arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic comes at time when North America is in the midst of a protracted overdose epidemic caused by a toxic illegal drug supply. Overdose deaths are likely to rise when people are isolated, social support programs are cut back, and the illicit drug supply is further compromised. Safer opioid distribution in response to a toxic street drug supply is a pragmatic and effective way to reduce overdose deaths. COVID-19 makes such an approach even more urgent and compelling.","Tyndall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102880","20200805","Covid-19; Drug Use; Harm Reduction; Overdose; Safe Supply","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Influence of Coronovirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic on the General Public, Medical Workers, and Patients With Mental Disorders and its Countermeasures","Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020, showed that the general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers, and patients with mental disorders.

"Emotional &quot;inflection point&quot; in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China","The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. In the T1 survey, the &quot;Typhoon Eye Effect&quot; appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; appeared, there was an &quot;Exposure Effect&quot;, the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. This survey found that there is an emotional &quot;infection point&quot; in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.","Zhang, Cao, Wang, Wang, Lei, Shou, Xie, Huang, Luo, Luo, Bian, Zhang, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.097","20200904","College students; Emotional â€œinflection pointâ€; New coronavirus pneumonia (NCP); Self-regulation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Anxiety and depression in COVID-19 survivors: Role of inflammatory and clinical predictors","Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could induce psychopathology, and psychiatric sequelae were observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks. The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors. We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension. Despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed increased scores on most psychopathological measures, with similar baseline inflammation. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression and anxiety at follow-up. PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years of life lived with disability. Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current insights on inflammation in psychiatry, and the present observation of worse inflammation leading to worse depression, we recommend to assess psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors and to deepen research on inflammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions.","Mazza, De Lorenzo, Conte, Poletti, Vai, Bollettini, Melloni, Furlan, Ciceri, Rovere-Querini, Benedetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037","20200810","Anxiety; COVID-19; COVID-19 survivors; Depression; Inflammation; Insomnia; Mental health; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; PTSD; Psychopathology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Caregivers' Mental Health and Somatic Symptoms During Covid-19","This study examines differences in the mental and physical health of the U.S. population during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic among three groups: non-caregivers, short-term caregivers (one year or less), and long-term caregivers (greater than one year). Data from the Understanding America Study are used to describe group differences in reports of psychological distress and somatic symptoms. Logistic and negative binomial regression models are used to examine whether these differences persist after adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and pre-pandemic health conditions. To understand within-group differences in caregiving demands, the intensity of care provided by short-term and long-term caregivers, as well as selected patients' health conditions are summarized. Adults' mental and physical health varied substantially by caregiver status. Caregivers continued to fare worse than non-caregivers in terms of mental health and fatigue, and long-term caregivers were more likely to report headache, body aches, and abdominal discomfort than both short-term caregivers and non-caregivers, net of controls. The nature of caregiving differed between short-term and long-term caregivers, with the latter more likely to provide greater hours of care, and to be looking after patients with permanent medical conditions. Efforts to understand and mitigate the impact of the pandemic on population health should include caregivers, whose mental and physical health were already vulnerable before COVID-19.","Park","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa121","20200901","Caregiving; Health Disparities; Mental Health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Epidemiology of mental health problems among patients with cancer during COVID-19 pandemic","The current study aimed to explore mental health problems in patients diagnosed with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cluster sampling, cross-sectional survey with 6213 cancer patients was conducted in one of the largest cancer centers in China. The socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, psychosomatic conditions, interpersonal relationships and social support, COVID-19 infection-related psychological stress, and mental health status were measured. Medical conditions were extracted from patients' electronic healthcare records. Among the 6213 cancer patients, 23.4% had depression, 17.7% had anxiety, 9.3% had PTSD, and 13.5% had hostility. Hierarchical liner regression models showed that having a history of mental disorder, excessive alcohol consumption, having a higher frequency of worrying about cancer management due to COVID-19, having a higher frequency feeling of overwhelming psychological pressure from COVID-19, and having a higher level of fatigue and pain were the predominant risk factors for mental health problems in cancer patients. However, there were only 1.6% of them were seeking psychological counseling during COVID-19. We also revealed the protective factors associated with lower risk of mental health problems among cancer patients. The present study revealed a high prevalence of mental health problems and gaps in mental health services for cancer patients, which also indicated high distress from COVID-19-elevated risks.

We will investigate the development of these psychological disturbances in HCPs at the treatment front line and second line during the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in different countries. Additionally, we will explore whether personal resilience factors and a work-related sense of coherence influence the development of mental health problems in HCPs. We plan to carry out a sequential qualitative-quantitative mixed-methods design study. The quantitative phase consists of a longitudinal online survey based on six validated questionnaires, to be completed at three points in time.

A purposive sampling of family members of persons with dementia registered in the database and seen within the previous 6 months. Thirty-one caregivers participated. Thematic analysis of the data showed two sets of issues that the caregivers of persons with dementia faced in their experiences during the pandemic. The first set was unique to the caregivers that directly related to their caregiving role, while the second set did not relate directly to their caregiving role. These two sets also appeared to have a two-way interaction influencing each other. These issues generated needs, some of which required immediate support while others required longer-term support. The caregivers suggested several methods, such as use of video-consultations, telephone-based support and clinic-based in-person visits to meet their needs. They also wanted more services postpandemic. Caregivers of persons with dementia had multiple needs during the pandemic. Supporting them during these times require a pragmatic multilayered approach.

"The COVID-19 anxiety syndrome scale: Development and psychometric properties","The central aim of our study was to widen the mental health response to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing and evaluating a measure that could be used to identify the presence of anxiety syndrome features associated with COVID-19. In Study 1, a community sample of 292 participants completed the newly developed COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19ASS) and results were subjected to a Principal Components Analysis. An 11-item two-factor structure was identified. In Study 2, a community sample of 426 participants completed a battery of questionnaires including the C-19ASS. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis was performed on the C-19ASS. A 9-item two-factor structure was confirmed. Results also indicated that the C-19ASS has acceptable levels of reliability and concurrent validity. The C-19ASS perseveration factor was found to explain an additional 9.3% variance in COVID-19 anxiety, and additional 2.2% variance in work and social adjustment (functional impairment), over and above all other variables.

Participants (NÂ =Â 641) were mothers of children age 0-8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0-18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.","Cameron, Joyce, Delaquis, Reynolds, Protudjer, Roos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.081","20200904","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Maternal; Mental health services","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Effects of quarantine on mental health of populations affected by Covid-19","To prevent the spread of the The novel coronavirus (2019-nCOV), some classic public health measures are being taken, such as social distancing and quarantine METHOD: Studies were identified using large-circulation international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The prolonged confinement is evidently related to psychological damage, considering that individuals would be subjected to stressors for a longer period of time . In some cases, these psychic losses lasted for many months after the end of this confinement CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop and implement actions to minimize the population psychological distress in meeting the needs of the communities affected by COVID-19 Thus, as it occurred in China, it is necessary that the other affected nations promote the publication of regulations that guide the implementation of mental health services and the allocation of resources, in order to ensure that individuals are monitored by competent professionals, thus reducing the psychological damage that can be motivated by the social isolation period during the quarantine.","de Lima, CÃ¢ndido, da Silva, Albuquerque, Soares, do Nascimento, de Oliveira, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.063","20200817","Mental Health; Quarantine; SARS-CoV-2; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. The case-control nature ofÂ the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.","Cai, Feng, Huang, Wang, Wang, Lu, Xie, Wang, Liu, Hou, Ouyang, Pan, Li, Fu, Deng, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031","20200817","Coronavirus disease 2019; Help-seeking behavior; Medical workers; Mental health; Severe acute respiratory syndrome from coronavirus 2; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Case-Control Studies; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large cross-sectional study","Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; PÂ =Â 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; PÂ =Â 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P&lt;0.001). All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity.

It articulates the RMG workers' existing vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic based on currently available evidence and personal conversations/communications with RMG workers. COVID-19 has already impacted RMG workers' health (both physical and mental health status) and wellbeing, and resulted in loss of employment. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on the garment workers, especially related to their health issues, financial hardship and inability to pay for essentials such as food, and future employment opportunities. The stakeholders (such as the international retailers/brands, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Government of Bangladesh) responsible for the global supply chain RMG factories should reconsider the health and overall wellbeing needs of the RMG workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Kabir, Maple, Usher","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa126","20200901","Bangladesh; COVID-19; crisis; health vulnerabilities; readymade garment workers; starvation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Safety and Efficacy of Casting during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison of the Mechanical Properties of Polymers Used for 3D Printing to Conventional Materials Used for the Generation of Orthopaedic Orthoses","To reduce the risk of spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the emerging protocols are advising for less physician-patient contact, shortening the contact time, and keeping a safe distance. It is recommended that unnecessary casting be avoided in the events that alternative methods can be applied such as in stable ankle fractures, and hindfoot/midfoot/forefoot injuries. Fiberglass casts are suboptimal because they require a follow up for cast removal while a conventional plaster cast is amenable to self-removal by submerging in water and cutting the cotton bandages with scissors. At present, only fiberglass casts are widely available to allow waterproof casting. To reduce the contact time during casting, a custom-made 3D printed casts/splints can be ordered remotely which reduces the number of visits and shortens the contact time while it allows for self-removal by the patient. The cast is printed after the limb is 3D scanned in 5-10 seconds using the commercially available 3D scanners. In contrast to the conventional casting, a 3D printed cast/splint is washable which is an advantage during an infectious crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sedigh, Kachooei, Beredjiklian, Vaccaro, Rivlin","https://doi.org/10.22038/abjs.2020.44038.2204","20200801","3D Printing; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Orthopaedic cast; Orthopaedic splint","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life and Influencing Factors for COVID-19 Patients, a Follow-Up at One Month","To survey the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its influencing factors among patients with COVID-19 in their first medical follow up. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were discharged from 12 hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang from Jan 17, 2020 to Mar 20, 2020. Prospectively collected and analyzed data included demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and chest CT imaging features at the first follow up, 1 month after discharge. All patients underwent the HRQoL evaluation with the Chinese version of Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) as well as a general condition questionnaire. Factors associated with SF-36 wereÂ constructed using linear regression. Predictors of impaired physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS) were identified by logistic regression. SF-36 demonstrated a significant difference in HRQoL in patients with COVID-19, except in physical function (PF), when compared to the general Chinese population (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). The multiple linear regressions demonstrated that age was negatively associated with PF, role physical (RP), but positively associated with vitality (VT) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). PF, bodily pain (BP), and role-emotional (RE) were negatively associated with the female sex (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). For mental health, the clinical subtypes were significant associated factors (<i>pâ€Š</i>&lt;â€Š0.05). Length of stay (LOS) was strongly negativelyÂ associated with RE and RP, and positively associated with VT (<i>p</i>&lt;â€Š0.05). Logistical regression revealed that non-obese overweight (OR 3.71) and obesity (OR 3.94) were risk factors for a low PCS and female sex (OR 2.22) was a risk factor for a low MCS. Health-related quality of life was poor among COVID-19 patients at the 1 month follow-up. Patients suffered from significant physical and psychological impairment. Therefore, prospective monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is needed in order to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, as well as to inform prompt and efficient interventions to alleviate suffering.","Chen, Li, Gong, Zhang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00668","20200801","COVID-19; SF-36; follow-up; health-related quality of life; influencing factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The double-edged relationship between COVID-19 stress and smoking: Implications for smoking cessation","Although recent research shows that smokers respond differently to the COVID-19 pandemic, it offers little explanation of why some have increased their smoking, while others decreased it. In this study, we examined a possible explanation for these different responses: pandemic-related stress. We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of Dutch current smokers from 11-18 May 2020 (n=957). During that period, COVID-19 was six weeks past the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the Netherlands. Included in the survey were measures of how the COVID-19 pandemic had changed their smoking, if at all (no change, increased smoking, decreased smoking), and a measure of stress due to COVID-19. Overall, while 14.1% of smokers reported smoking less due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 18.9% of smokers reported smoking more. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a dose-response effect of stress: smokers who were somewhat stressed were more likely to have either increased (OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.49-3.78) or reduced (OR=1.80; 95% CI: 1.07-3.05) their smoking. Severely stressed smokers were even more likely to have either increased (OR=3.75; 95% CI: 1.84-7.64) or reduced (OR=3.97; 95% CI: 1.70-9.28) their smoking. Thus, stress was associated with both increased and reduced smoking, independently from perceived difficulty of quitting and level of motivation to quit. Stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic appears to affect smokers in different ways, some smokers increase their smoking while others decrease it. While boredom and restrictions in movement might have stimulated smoking, the threat of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill might have motivated others to improve their health by quitting smoking. These data highlight the importance of providing greater resources for cessation services and the importance of creating public campaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic time.","Bommele, Hopman, Walters, Geboers, Croes, Fong, Quah, Willemsen","https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/125580","20200801","COVID-19; The Netherlands; smoking; smoking behavior; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychiatric face of COVID-19","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a severe multiorgan pathology which, besides cardio-respiratory manifestations, affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similarly to other coronaviruses demonstrate neurotropism; the viral infection of the brain stem may complicate the course of the disease through damaging central cardio-respiratory control. The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 represent serious clinical challenge that has to be considered for future complex therapies.","Steardo, Steardo, Verkhratsky","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00949-5","20200818","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Pseudoscientific beliefs and psychopathological risks increase after COVID-19 social quarantine","The health crisis caused by COVID-19 has led many countries to opt for social quarantine of the population. During this quarantine, communication systems have been characterized by disintermediation, the acceleration of digitization and an infodemic (excess and saturation of information). The following debate arises: Do the levels related to the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs related to the interpretation of information vary before and after social quarantine? This research aims to examine the psychological effects of social quarantine on the psychotic phenotype and pseudoscientific beliefs-experiences of the general nonclinical population. The following hypothesis was posed: social quarantine alters the levels of magical thinking, pseudoscientific beliefs and anomalous perceptions due to quarantine. A pre- and posttest analysis design was applied based on the difference in means, and complementary Bayesian estimation was performed. A total of 174 Spanish subjects responded to different questionnaires that evaluated psychopathological risks based on psychotic phenotypes, pseudoscientific beliefs and experiences before and after quarantine. Significant differences were obtained for the variables positive psychotic symptoms, depressive symptoms, and certain perceptual alterations (e.g., cenesthetic perceptions), and a significant increase in pseudoscientific beliefs was also observed. The perceptual disturbances that increased the most after quarantine were those related to derealization and depersonalization. However, paranoid perceptions showed the highest increase, doubling the initial standard deviation. These high increases could be related to the delimitation of physical space during social quarantine and distrust towards information communicated by the government to the population. Is it possible that social alarmism generated by the excess of information and pseudoscientific information has increased paranoid perceptual alterations? Measures taken after quarantine indicate that perceptual disturbances, subclinical psychotic symptoms and beliefs in the pseudoscience have increased. We discuss which elements of quarantine coincide with the social marginality theory and its clinical repercussions.","EscolÃ -GascÃ³n, MarÃ­n, RusiÃ±ol, Gallifa","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00603-1","20200804","COVID-19; Pseudoscientific beliefs; Psychotic disorders; Psychotic phenotype; SARS-CoV-2; Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Risk Assessment; Social Isolation; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The SARS-CoV-2 and mental health: From biological mechanisms to social consequences","In December 2019, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) infection was reported. In only few weeks it has caused a global pandemic, with mortality reaching 3.4%, mostly due to a severe pneumonia. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the central nervous system (CNS) and mental health outcomes remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of other types of coronaviruses in the brain, especially in the brainstem. There is evidence that the novel coronavirus can penetrate CNS through the olfactory or circulatory route as well as it can have an indirect impact on the brain by causing cytokine storm. There are also first reports of neurological signs in patients infected by the SARS-Cov-2. They show that COVID-19 patients have neurologic manifestations like acute cerebrovascular disease, conscious disturbance, taste and olfactory disturbances. In addition, there are studies showing that certain psychopathological symptoms might appear in infected patients, including those related to mood and psychotic disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder. Accumulating evidence also indicates that the pandemic might have a great impact on mental health from the global perspective, with medical workers being particularly vulnerable. In this article, we provide a review of studies investigating the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS and mental health outcomes. We describe neurobiology of the virus, highlighting the relevance to mental disorders. Furthermore, this article summarizes the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 from the public health perspective. Finally, we present a critical appraisal of evidence and indicate future directions for studies in this field.","SzczeÅ›niak, GÅ‚adka, Misiak, Cyran, Rymaszewska","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110046","20200824",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation From CT Images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Zhou, Ji, Zhou, Chen, Fu, Shen, Shao","https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2020.2996645","20200814","Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Lung; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Supervised Machine Learning; Tomography, X-Ray Computed","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A Scoping Review of Literature About Mental Health and Well-Being Among Immigrant Communities in the United States","Immigration-both the experience of migrating and events after migration-can affect the mental health and well-being of immigrants and their communities. However, evidence suggests that immigrants in the United States do not access mental health services to the same extent as nonimmigrants. In particular, immigrant adolescents and young adults may have unique stressors related to their developmental stage, experiences in school and with peer groups, and shifting roles within family systems. This scoping review summarizes findings from published research studies and practitioner-focused gray literature about the mental health needs of immigrant communities in the United States. The review finds that specific mental health needs vary across factors like age, racial/ethnic group, immigration status, and place of residency. Findings also indicate that structural factors like immigration-related laws affect both access to mental health services and stressors in the overall environment for immigrants and their families. This review also explores models of community-level initiatives that utilize strengths-based approaches to promoting mental health and well-being among immigrant communities. Findings highlight the need for a better understanding of the mental health needs and current barriers to care among diverse immigrant populations, as immigration continues to play a major role in U.S. public policy and discourse. The COVID-19 pandemic taking place as this article goes to press in 2020 also raises questions regarding health equity and access for marginalized populations, including immigrants and their communities, and so these findings also indicate the need for further interdisciplinary research to assess intersections among the pandemic's many impacts, including those related to mental health and well-being.","Rodriguez, Hill, McDaniel","https://doi.org/10.1177/1524839920942511","20200730","health disparities; health research; international/cross-cultural health; minority health; qualitative research; social determinants of health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological sequelae within different populations during the COVID-19 pandemic: a rapid review of extant evidence","The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has a potentially significant impact on not only physical health but also psychological well-being. To our best knowledge, no review thus far has consolidated the psychological impact of COVID-19 across different subpopulations. A systematic search of the literature until 15 June 2020 found 150 empirical papers pertinent to the mental health consequences of the pandemic. The majority (87.3%) were from China (45.3%), the rest of Asia (22.0%) and Europe (20.0%), and mostly examined the general population (37.3%), healthcare workers (31.3%) and those with pre-existing mental and physical illnesses (14.7%).

"Children and adolescents with eating disorders during COVID-19 confinement: Difficulties and future challenges","To present the adaptations to treatment protocols made in a child and adolescent eating disorders (ED) unit during the eight-week confinement period mandated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and examine clinical and treatment variables in the outpatient, day hospital, and inpatient care programs. Description of the implementation of a combined teletherapy program for outpatient and day-hospital patients and the adaptations made to the inpatient protocol. Retrospective review of medical records and analysis of general and specific variables related to the pandemic and confinement. We held 1,329 (73.10%) telehealth consultations and 489 (26.9%) face-to-face outpatient visits with 365 patients undergoing treatment in the outpatient clinic or day hospital. Twenty-eight (7.67%) were initial evaluations. Twenty-two patients were newly admitted and 68 ED-related emergencies were attended. Almost half of the children and adolescents studied experienced reactivation of ED symptoms despite treatment, and severe patients (25%) presented self-harm and suicide risk. The implementation of a combined teletherapy program has enabled continuity of care during confinement for children and adolescents with ED. Delivery of treatment to adolescents in the day hospital program posed the biggest challenge due to their greater degrees of severity and higher hospitalization rates. An adapted inpatient program should be maintained throughout confinement, as the need for hospitalization of children and adolescents with ED does not decrease with lockdown.","Graell, MorÃ³n-Nozaleda, Camarneiro, VillaseÃ±or, YÃ¡Ã±ez, MuÃ±oz, MartÃ­nez-NÃºÃ±ez, MiguÃ©lez-FernÃ¡ndez, MuÃ±oz, Faya","https://doi.org/10.1002/erv.2763","20200730","COVID-19; adolescents; children; confinement; eating disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Chest CT for early detection and management of coronavirus disease (COVID-19): a report of 314 patients admitted to Emergency Department with suspected pneumonia","The purpose of our study was to assess the potential role of chest CT in the early detection of COVID-19 pneumonia and to explore its role in patient management in an adult Italian population admitted to the Emergency Department. Three hundred and fourteen patients presented with clinically suspected COVID-19, from March 3 to 23, 2020, were evaluated with PaO2/FIO2 ratio from arterial blood gas, RT-PCR assay from nasopharyngeal swab sample and chest CT. Patients were classified as COVID-19 negative and COVID-19 positive according to RT-PCR results, considered as a reference. Images were independently evaluated by two radiologists blinded to the RT-PCR results and classified as &quot;CT positive&quot; or &quot;CT negative&quot; for COVID-19, according to CT findings. According to RT-PCR results, 152 patients were COVID-19 negative (48%) and 162 were COVID-19 positive (52%). We found substantial agreement between RT-PCR results and CT findings (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.000001), as well as an almost perfect agreement between the two readers. Mixed GGO and consolidation pattern with peripheral and bilateral distribution, multifocal or diffuse abnormalities localized in both upper lung and lower lung, in association with interlobular septal thickening, bronchial wall thickening and air bronchogram, showed higher frequency in COVID-positive patients. We also found a significant correlation between CT findings and patient's oxygenation status expressed by PaO2/FIO2 ratio. Chest CT has a useful role in the early detection and in patient management of COVID-19 pneumonia in a pandemic. It helps in identifying suspected patients, cutting off the route of transmission and avoiding further spread of infection.","Gaia, Maria Chiara, Silvia, Chiara, Maria Luisa, Giulia, Silvia, Lucia, Alessandra, Annarita, Cristina, Maria, Maria Rosaria, Giacinta, Riccardo, Zaher, Andrea, Maddalena, Catalano, Paolo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11547-020-01256-1","20200901","COVID-19; Chest CT; Emergency radiology; Pandemic; Pneumonia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"One Month into the Reinforcement of Social Distancing due to the COVID-19 Outbreak: Subjective Health, Health Behaviors, and Loneliness among People with Chronic Medical Conditions","We sought to examine how the near-lockdown measures, announced by the Israeli government in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, impacted the self-rated health (SRH), health behaviors, and loneliness of people with chronic illnesses. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out about one month (April 20-22, 2020) after the Israeli government reinforced the severe social distancing regulations, among a convenience sample of 315 participants (60% women) with chronic conditions (27% metabolic, 17% cardiovascular, 21% cancer/autoimmune, 18% orthopedic/pain, 12% mental-health). Results suggested that about half of the participants reported a decline in physical or mental SRH, and as many as two-thirds reported feeling lonely. A significant deterioration in health behaviors was reported, including a decrease in vegetable consumption (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and physical activity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), an increase in time spent on social media (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and a perception among about half of the participants that they were eating more than before. Ordinal regression suggested that a decline in general SRH was linked with female gender (<i>p</i> = 0.016), lack of higher education (<i>p</i> = 0.015), crowded housing conditions (<i>p</i> = 0.001), longer illness duration (<i>p</i> = 0.010), and loneliness (<i>p</i> = 0.008). Findings highlight the important role of loneliness in SRH during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Future studies are warranted to clarify the long-term effects of social-distancing and loneliness on people with chronic illnesses.","Elran-Barak, Mozeikov","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155403","20200811","COVID-19; chronic illness; health behaviors; loneliness; self-rated health; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Government; Health Behavior; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Distance; Social Media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Management of Agitation During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has radically altered delivery of care in emergency settings. Unprecedented hardship due to ongoing fears of exposure and threats to personal safety, along with societal measures enacted to curb disease transmission, have had broad psychosocial impact on patients and healthcare workers alike. These changes can significantly affect diagnosing and managing behavioral emergencies such as agitation in the emergency department. On behalf of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry, we highlight unique considerations for patients with severe behavioral symptoms and staff members managing symptoms of agitation during COVID-19. Early detection and treatment of agitation, precautions to minimize staff hazards, coordination with security personnel and psychiatric services, and avoidance of coercive strategies that cause respiratory depression will help mitigate heightened risks to safety caused by this outbreak.","Wong, Roppolo, Chang, Yonkers, Wilson, Powsner, Rozel","https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2020.5.47789","20200805","Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Service, Hospital; Health Personnel; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Coronaviruses: a challenge of today and a call for extended human postmortem brain analyses","While there is abounding literature on virus-induced pathology in general and coronavirus in particular, recent evidence accumulates showing distinct and deleterious brain affection. As the respiratory tract connects to the brain without protection of the blood-brain barrier, SARS-CoV-2 might in the early invasive phase attack the cardiorespiratory centres located in the medulla/pons areas, giving rise to disturbances of respiration and cardiac problems. Furthermore, brainstem regions are at risk to lose their functional integrity. Therefore, long-term neurological as well as psychiatric symptomatology and eventual respective disorders cannot be excluded as evidenced from influenza-A triggered post-encephalitic Parkinsonism and HIV-1 triggered AIDS-dementia complex. From the available evidences for coronavirus-induced brain pathology, this review concludes a number of unmet needs for further research strategies like human postmortem brain analyses. SARS-CoV-2 mirroring experimental animal brain studies, characterization of time-dependent and region-dependent spreading behaviours of coronaviruses, enlightening of pathological mechanisms after coronavirus infection using long-term animal models and clinical observations of patients having had COVID-19 infection are calling to develop both protective strategies and drug discoveries to avoid early and late coronavirus-induced functional brain disturbances, symptoms and eventually disorders. To fight SARS-CoV-2, it is an urgent need to enforce clinical, molecular biological, neurochemical and genetic research including brain-related studies on a worldwide harmonized basis.","Riederer, Ter Meulen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-020-02230-x","20200826","Alzheimerâ€™s disease; Brain bank; Brain pathology; Brain stem; COVID-19; Cardiorespiratory centre; Cognitive dysfunction; Coronavirus; Depression; Movement disorders; Multiple sclerosis; Neuroinvasion; Neurological symptoms/disorders; Neuroprotection; Parkinsonism; Parkinsonâ€™s disease; Postmortem studies; SARS-CoV-2 brain disorders; Therapy; Betacoronavirus; Blood-Brain Barrier; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Diagnosis; Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Time Factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in Italian MS patients: signs of resilience?","Anxiety, depression and reduction of quality of life (QoL) are common in people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS). Fear of getting sick from COVID-19, government's lockdown and the imposed social distancing might have hadÂ an impact on psychological distress and QoL. The aim of our study was to investigate anxiety, depression and QoL changes in pwMS during SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and lockdown in Italy. 67 pwMS with a previous (less than 6Â months) neuropsychological evaluation before SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (T0) were re-evaluated at the time of the outbreak and lockdown in Italy (T1). They underwent a clinical and neurological evaluation and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1), the Beck Depression Inventory second edition (BDI-II), and Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MsQoL-54) at T0 and T1. Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied to control the false discovery rate. BDI-II and STAI-Y1 scores did not change between T0 and T1. At T1, MsQoL-54 scores were higher on the satisfaction with sexual life and the social function subscales, and lower on the limitation due to emotional problems subscale. This is the first study that evaluated mood and QoL levels before and during the lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic in pwMS. No worsening of anxiety and depression levels was found. Contrariwise some improvements were noted on QoL, the most reliable regarding the sexual satisfaction and the social function.","Capuano, Altieri, Bisecco, d'Ambrosio, Docimo, Buonanno, Matrone, Giuliano, Tedeschi, Santangelo, Gallo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-10099-9","20200731","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Lockdown; Multiple sclerosis; Sexual satisfaction","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"CoViD-19 and psychiatry: can mental illness justify further exceptions to the obligation to stay at home?","To face the CoViD-19 pandemic, the italian government has approved regulations which state, with no exceptions, that it is considered offence for people tested positive to the virus to leave their house, whereas other people are allowed to leave their house for proven needs such as work, health or emergencies. The authors contextualize these regulations with European and international sets of principles, in the light of the characteristics that some psychiatric disorders can present. Evaluate if such European principles need to be implemented with further specific exceptions to the obligation to stay at home for some people with mental disorders. Prohibition to leave the house can aggravate mental disorders, resulting in the concrete risk of harmful actions, in particular in psychotic and bipolar patients, even with mild excitement, depressed patients, or in cases of delusional patients, resulting from uninterrupted cohabitation with emotionally significant family members. Even the health of subjects with anxiety pathologies, or with different forms of mental retardation can be prejudiced by forced permanence at home. From numerous provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union there emerges that collective health must be balanced with individual health and with the dignity of the human person. As the European and international provisions are hierarchically above the national provisions, the latter should be interpreted so that the non-compliance to the obligation to stay at home: a) does not constitute offence for a person tested positive to the virus, if therapeutic treatments resulting in hospitalization are deemed necessary; b) it does not constitute administrative offence if the subject proves, based on clinical and factual documented evidence, that leaving the house is necessary to avoid recrudescence of mental disorder. In addition, for evaluation purposes, particular attention should be paid to the severity of psychiatric illness in the specific case. In order to distinguish suitable subjects from those not suitable for home isolation, the reference criterion cannot be the only diagnostic element, but it will be necessary to take into account above all the severity of the condition. In the absence of such a qualitative assessment, there would be a risk of unfounded infringements of the obligation to stay at home.","Montanari Vergallo, Bersani, Rinaldi","https://doi.org/10.1708/3417.34002","20200813","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emergencies; Europe; Government Regulation; Health Services Needs and Demand; Human Rights; Humans; Italy; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Patient Compliance; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Work","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Acute mental health responses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","The acute and long-term mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic are unknown. The current study examined the acute mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in 5070 adult participants in Australia, using an online survey administered during the peak of the outbreak in Australia (27th March to 7th April 2020). Self-report questionnaires examined COVID-19 fears and behavioural responses to COVID-19, as well as the severity of psychological distress (depression, anxiety and stress), health anxiety, contamination fears, alcohol use, and physical activity. 78% of respondents reported that their mental health had worsened since the outbreak, one quarter (25.9%) were very or extremely worried about contracting COVID-19, and half (52.7%) were worried about family and friends contracting COVID-19. Uncertainty, loneliness and financial worries (50%) were common. Rates of elevated psychological distress were higher than expected, with 62%, 50%, and 64% of respondents reporting elevated depression, anxiety and stress levels respectively, and one in four reporting elevated health anxiety in the past week. Participants with self-reported history of a mental health diagnosis had significantly higher distress, health anxiety, and COVID-19 fears than those without a prior mental health diagnosis. Demographic (e.g., non-binary or different gender identity; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status), occupational (e.g., being a carer or stay at home parent), and psychological (e.g., perceived risk of contracting COVID-19) factors were associated with distress. Results revealed that precautionary behaviours (e.g., washing hands, using hand sanitiser, avoiding social events) were common, although in contrast to previous research, higher engagement in hygiene behaviours was associated with higher stress and anxiety levels. These results highlight the serious acute impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of respondents, and the need for proactive, accessible digital mental health services to address these mental health needs, particularly for those most vulnerable, including people with prior history of mental health problems. Longitudinal research is needed to explore long-term predictors of poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Newby, O'Moore, Tang, Christensen, Faasse","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236562","20200803","Adult; Anxiety; Australia; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Fear; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Compliance to Recommendations and Mental Health Consequences among Elderly in Sweden during the Initial Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic-A Cross Sectional Online Survey","Background (1): In the wake of COVID-19, elderly people have been labelled a risk group. As the pandemic is a new crisis in Sweden, we have no knowledge on how this group perceives the information and recommendations being provided. Complying with these recommendations entails physical distancing and, for some, isolation at home. Methods (2): From 16 April to 15 May 2020, we conducted an online survey targeting people aged 70 and older in Sweden (n = 1854). Results (3): A vast majority of the participants find the information and recommendations clear and reliable. Half of the participants report staying at home all the time, and up to half report decreased mental health in terms of, e.g., feeling depressed, having sleeping problems and that isolation makes them feel bad. However, elderly people are not a homogenous group, and there are gender and demographic differences. (4) Conclusion: At this point, we do not know the full extent of the ongoing pandemic, either in terms of duration or in terms of losses. The Swedish model for action on COVID-19 has not included a lock down. However, elderly people seem to comply with recommendations and practice social distancing to a high degree. This might lead to decreased mental health and long-term effects.","Gustavsson, Beckman","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155380","20200811","COVID-19; mental health; older adults; risk perception; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Perceived Job Insecurity and Depressive Symptoms among Italian Dentists: The Moderating Role of Fear of COVID-19","Containment measures adopted to reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have produced a general perception of job insecurity. Dentists have been highly affected by such measures, as they represent an easy source of contagion. As perceived job insecurity is associated with psychological distress and Italian dentists have been highly affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in terms of potential financial loss and the risk of being infected, this study aimed at assessing whether the fear of COVID-19 moderated the effect of perceived job insecurity on depressive symptoms. This cross-sectional online study has included 735 Italian dentists recruited during the lockdown and ranging in age from 27 to 70 years old (495 men and 240 women). A quantile regression model with an inference based on the median and with an interaction term between the fear of COVID-19 and perceived job insecurity has been used to estimate the hypothesized associations. The results indicated that both perceived job insecurity and fear of COVID-19 were positively associated with depressive symptoms, and that the effect of perceived job insecurity on depressive symptoms was weaker among those with a low fear of COVID-19. The findings may inform public health policies for dentists in relation to reducing the risk of developing negative mental health outcomes.","Gasparro, Scandurra, Maldonato, Dolce, Bochicchio, Valletta, Sammartino, Sammartino, Mariniello, di Lauro, Marenzi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155338","20200821","COVID-19; dentists; depression; fear; job insecurity; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dentists; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Employment; Fear; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Digital Tools to Ameliorate Psychological Symptoms Associated With COVID-19: Scoping Review","In the four months after the discovery of the index case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several studies highlighted the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline health care workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: &quot;NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID&quot; and &quot;mHealth OR eHealth OR text&quot;. Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological distress.

"Mental health services for mood disorder outpatients in Milan during COVID-19 outbreak: The experience of the health care providers at San Raffaele hospital","The spread of COVID-19 throughout Italy, particularly Lombardy, led to adopt quarantine measures, known to exacerbate pre-existing psychiatric conditions. We described a telephone-based surveillance on 101 euthymic Mood Disorder outpatients in Milan by a non-standardized survey to evaluate reactions to lockdown measures and the presence of quarantine stressors. Frustration was the most represented quarantine stressor. Being jobless was significantly related to the presence of frustration, somatization, increased alertness, psychic anxiety and low mood; younger age to the presence of psychic anxiety, alertness and financial concerns.

"Early impact of COVID-19 on individuals with self-reported eating disorders: A survey of ~1,000 individuals in the United States and the Netherlands","We evaluated the early impact of COVID-19 on people with self-reported eating disorders. Participants in the United States (US, N = 511) and the Netherlands (NL, N = 510), recruited through ongoing studies and social media, completed an online survey that included both quantitative measures and free-text responses assessing the impact of COVID-19 on situational circumstances, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder treatment, and general well-being. Results revealed strong and wide-ranging effects on eating disorder concerns and illness behaviors that were consistent with eating disorder type. Participants with anorexia nervosa (US 62% of sample; NL 69%) reported increased restriction and fears about being able to find foods consistent with their meal plan. Individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (US 30% of sample; NL 15%) reported increases in their binge-eating episodes and urges to binge. Respondents noted marked increases in anxiety since 2019 and reported greater concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health than physical health. Although many participants acknowledged and appreciated the transition to telehealth, limitations of this treatment modality for this population were raised. Individuals with past histories of eating disorders noted concerns about relapse related to COVID-19 circumstances. Encouragingly, respondents also noted positive effects including greater connection with family, more time for self-care, and motivation to recover. COVID-19 is associated with increased anxiety and poses specific disorder-related challenges for individuals with eating disorders that require attention by healthcare professionals and carers.","Termorshuizen, Watson, Thornton, Borg, Flatt, MacDermod, Harper, van Furth, Peat, Bulik","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23353","20200728","COVID-19; coronavirus; eating disorders; mental health; pandemic; quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Prevention and Control of COVID-19 Infection in a Chinese Mental Health Center","Faced with the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a global public health threat, psychiatric hospitals are under huge pressure to prevent and control nosocomial infection. The current research analyzed the COVID-19 infection control practices in a regional mental health center in China and addressed how this type of medical institutions could enhance their ability to prevent and control hospital transmission of major respiratory diseases and general management of nosocomial infection risks. Firstly, hospital-related risks of COVID-19 were analyzed, and targeted prevention and control measures were then established. Pre- and post-intervention theoretical knowledge of nosocomial infection control, hand hygiene compliance and accuracy, use of personal protective equipment, and disinfection and sterilization effectiveness were evaluated and compared. All the indexes displayed significant improvements following the implementation of the prevention and control measures. Up to the submission of this paper, the mental health center had obtained no suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 infection due to hospital transmission. The findings provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the COVID-19 preventive strategies and have important implications for integrated and characterized infection control in mental health centers during a major epidemic. The establishment of the transitional isolation ward and air fumigation using traditional Chinese medicine for patients and staff are preventive measures worthy of further discussion and dissemination.","Yang, Wang, Li, Zhang, Liu, He, Gao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00356","20200729","mental health center; nosocomial infection; outbreak; prevention and control practice; the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Modified Bhramari Pranayama in Covid 19 Infection","The Coronavirus (2019-Cov-2) infection Covid-19 is highly contagious caused by single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) with nucleocapsid and spreading widely all across the world and responsible for more than 3.6 million morbidity and 0.25 million mortality No specific treatment is available till date. The clinical symptoms are mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure involving. Kidney, Liver and Heart along with coagulopathies. During 2004 (SARS-CoV) pandemic role of nitric oxide in its management is well demonstrated. Nitric Oxide (NO) reversed pulmonary hypertension. Improved severe hypoxia and shortened the stay in ICU and ventilatory support. Nitric Oxide increased the survival rate. The genetic composition of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is almost similar to Covid-19, thus indicates good chances of effectiveness or enhancement in results by Nitric Oxide along with other modes in treatment of Covid-19. It has been proved by studies by serendipity humming increases NO Expression dramatically.It is estimated that humming increases the endogenous generation of nitric oxide level by 15-fold. Hypoxia in ARD Syndrome leads to blood coagulation by depression of body defence anticoagulatory and fibrolytic properties along with metabolic acidosis. If we go into hypoxic hypercapnic state no hyper coagulation takes place.

"Epilepsy Care in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Risk Factors for Seizure Worsening","<b>Objective:</b> In early 2020, Italy struggled with an unprecedented health emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, is being sorely neglected. In this national survey, we aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the care of people with epilepsy (PwE) and identifying PwE risk factors for seizure worsening to direct telemedicine efforts. <b>Methods:</b> We administered a 48-items online survey (published on April 11, 2020) including socio-demographic, epilepsy-related, and psychometric variables (BDI-II for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, and PSQI for sleep) to PwE and people without epilepsy (PwoE). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. <b>Results:</b> We collected responses from 456 PwE (344 females) and 472 PwoE (347 females). Outpatient examinations of PwE were postponed in 95% of cases. One-third of PwE complained of issues with epilepsy management, but only 71% of them reached the treating physician and solved their problems. PwE had worse depressive and anxiety symptoms (higher BDI-II and GAD-7 scores; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than PwoE. Sleep quality was equally compromised in both groups (47 and 42%). Sixty-seven PwE (18%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by the number of anti-seizure medications (ASM) of chronic therapy and the severity of sleep disorder. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced difficulties in follow-up and a seizure number increase, in particular those chronically taking more ASMs and with poor sleep quality. This dramatic experience outlines the urgent need for validation and implementation of telemedicine services for epileptic patients in order to provide regular follow-up.","Assenza, Lanzone, Brigo, Coppola, Di Gennaro, Di Lazzaro, Ricci, Romigi, Tombini, Mecarelli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00737","20200729","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; epilepsy; sleep","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Parents' Stress and Children's Psychological Problems in Families Facing the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy","<b>Objectives:</b> The present study aimed to explore the effect of risk factors associated with the COVID-19 outbreak experience on parents' and children's well-being. <b>Methods:</b> Parents of children aged between 2- and 14-years-old completed an online survey reporting their home environment conditions, any relation they had to the pandemic consequences, their difficulties experienced due to the quarantine, their perception of individual and parent-child dyadic stress, and their children's emotional and behavioral problems. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that the perception of the difficulty of quarantine is a crucial factor that undermines both parents' and children's well-being. Quarantine's impact on children's behavioral and emotional problems is mediated by parent's individual and dyadic stress, with a stronger effect from the latter. Parents who reported more difficulties in dealing with quarantine show more stress. This, in turn, increases the children's problems. Living in a more at-risk area, the quality of the home environment, or the relation they have with the pandemic consequences, do not have an effect on families' well-being. <b>Conclusions:</b> Dealing with quarantine is a particularly stressful experience for parents who must balance personal life, work, and raising children, being left alone without other resources. This situation puts parents at a higher risk of experiencing distress, potentially impairing their ability to be supportive caregivers. The lack of support these children receive in such a difficult moment may be the reason for their more pronounced psychological symptoms. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health, and supportive interventions for the immediate and for the future should be promoted.","Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, Fasolo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01713","20200729","COVID-19; children; children behavioral problems; children emotional problems; parent stress; parents","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Covid-19 and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review","Cardiac injury in patients infected with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) seems to be associated with higher morbimortality. We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-Î±) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. HypertensionÂ (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.","Azevedo, Botelho, Hollanda, Ferreira, Junqueira de Andrade, Oei, Mello, Muxfeldt","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41371-020-0387-4","20200731",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health in Elderly Spanish People in Times of COVID-19 Outbreak","We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged â‰¥60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]); and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]). There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. Older people have shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women. Economic loss and substance use should be monitored to guarantee the emotional well-being of the elderly.","GarcÃ­a-FernÃ¡ndez, Romero-Ferreiro, LÃ³pez-RoldÃ¡n, Padilla, Rodriguez-Jimenez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.027","20200731","COVID-19; acute stress; anxiety; depression; elderly","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Sedentarism and chronic disease risk in COVID 19 lockdown - a scoping review","Though viewed as a critical measure to prevent the spread of the virus, a prolonged homestay may result in unfavourable sedentary behaviour and chronic disease risk. This systematic review focuses on sedentary behaviour resulting from this quarantine period which may elevate the cardiovascular disease risk, obesity, hypertension, cancer and mental health illness. Evidence of breaking sedentary behaviour and global recommendations were investigated. Potential unanswered questions regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity during lockdown were explored. Five systematic reviews and six prospective trials explored the effect of sedentarism affecting chronic disease through potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting is found to be a pleiotropic risk factor with altered energy expenditure, adipogenic signalling, immunomodulation, autonomic stability and hormonal dysregulation perpetuating underlying chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Breaking sitting and physical activity are found to reverse the adverse effects associated with excessive sitting during the lockdown.","Chandrasekaran, Ganesan","https://doi.org/10.1177/0036933020946336","20200728","Sitting; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; exercise; obesity; physical activity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

It has been consistently shown that a high proportion of HCWs is at greater risk for developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS). The present study systematic reviewed studies conducted in the context of the three major Coronavirus outbreaks of the last two decades to investigate risk and resilience factors for PTSD and PTSS in HCWs. Nineteen studies on the SARS 2003 outbreak, two on the MERS 2012 outbreak and three on the COVID-19 ongoing outbreak were included. Some variables were found to be of particular relevance as risk factors as well as resilience factors, including exposure level, working role, years of work experience, social and work support, job organization, quarantine, age, gender, marital status, and coping styles. It will be critical to account for these factors when planning effective intervention strategies, to enhance the resilience and reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs facing the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Carmassi, Foghi, Dell'Oste, Cordone, Bertelloni, Bui, Dell'Osso","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113312","20200903","Corona; Mental health; Nurses; Physicians; Psychological distress; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios RESULTS: : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2-5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20-68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs.

"Signal of increased opioid overdose during COVID-19 from emergency medical services data","Individuals with opioid use disorder may be at heightened risk of opioid overdose during the COVID-19 period of social isolation, economic distress, and disrupted treatment services delivery. This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.","Slavova, Rock, Bush, Quesinberry, Walsh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176","20200819","COVID-19; Emergency medical services; Interrupted time series; Opioid overdose; Segmented regression; Analgesics, Opioid; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Collection; Drug Overdose; Emergency Medical Services; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Anxiety and depression in the Republic of Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic in Ireland resulted in a nationwide quarantine on March 27, 2020. This study represents the first assessment of rates of anxiety and depression in the general population of Ireland during the pandemic. Our first aim was to estimate the probable prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depression and to identify sociodemographic risk factors associated with screening positive for GAD or depression. Our second aim was to determine if COVID-19 related anxiety was highest amongst those in society at greatest risk of morality from COVID-19. Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative Irish sample (NÂ =Â 1041) online between March 31 and April 5; the first week of the nationwide quarantine measures. Recognized cut-off scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 were used to estimate rates of GAD and depression. Correlates of screening positive for GAD or depression were assessed using logistic regression analysis. GAD (20.0%), depression (22.8%) and GAD or depression (27.7%) was common. Screening positive for GAD or depression was associated with younger age, female sex, loss of income due to COVID-19, COVID-19 infection and higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection. Citizens aged 65 and older had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 related anxiety than adults aged 18-34. Initial results from this multi-wave study monitoring changes in population anxiety and depression throughout the pandemic indicate that GAD and depression were common experiences in the population during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hyland, Shevlin, McBride, Murphy, Karatzias, Bentall, Martinez, ValliÃ¨res","https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13219","20200810","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Descriptive cross-sectional study. Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG &quot;Most of the time&quot; or &quot;Strictly.&quot; Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Callow, Arnold-Nedimala, Jordan, Pena, Won, Woodard, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024","20200801","COVID-19; Mood; activity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological stress among health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease Outbreak: Cases from online consulting customers","During the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, online consulting has been widely used to address mental health problems, including health care professionals (HCPs) caring for COVID-19 patients who experienced substantial psychological distress. To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using Ï‡<sup>2</sup>-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. The sample overall (nÂ =Â 34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS meanÂ =Â 15.71Â Â±Â 4.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-9Â â‰¥Â 5) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-7Â â‰¥Â 5). Those working at intensive care units (ICUs) or in departments of respiratory medicine (RM) demonstrated significantly higher perceived stress than those at other departments (adjusted mean: 17.48Â Â±Â 0.96 vs. 13.06Â Â±Â 1.25, pÂ =Â .018, partial Î·<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 0.173). High perceived stress was most strongly associated with being depressed (betaÂ =Â 0.486, pÂ =Â .002) and working at ICUs/RM (betaÂ =Â 0.345, pÂ =Â .023). The psychological health status of frontline health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak warrants clinical attention. Online mental health services has played a major role although its effectiveness and barriers to its utilisation require further evaluation.","Ma, Rosenheck, He","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102905","20200730","COVID-19; Health care professionals; Intensive care units; Online mental health services; Psychological distress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Factors Influencing Anxiety of Health Care Workers in the Radiology Department with High Exposure Risk to COVID-19","BACKGROUND During the outbreak of COVID-19, health care workers in the radiology department frequently interact with suspected patients and face a higher risk of infection and sudden surges in workload. High anxiety levels seriously harm physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is critical to determine anxiety levels of health care workers and explore its risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the anxiety and resilience of 364 health care workers with high exposure risk from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze factors related to anxiety. RESULTS The mean anxiety score was 44.28Â±8.93 and 23.4% of our study participants reported mild (n=63), moderate (n=19), or severe (n=3) anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, job position, availability of protective materials, signs of suspected symptoms, and susceptibility to emotions and behaviors of people around them were identified as risk factors for anxiety, whereas psychological resilience was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that the anxiety level of health care workers in the radiology department with a high exposure risk to COVID-19 was high in the early stage of the outbreak, although the majority remained within normal limits. Timely assessment and effective intervention measures can improve the mental health of these at-risk populations.","Huang, Wang, Liu, Ye, Chen, Xu, Qu, Ning","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.926008","20200730","Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Self Evaluation; Fear; Female; Health Personnel; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Radiology Department, Hospital; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Factors; Sampling Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Workload","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy","The COVID-19 pandemic represents one of the most stressful events of recent times. Among the population, healthcare professionals who treat COVID-19 patients are most likely to develop psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The present study thus aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Italian healthcare workers. The responses of 145 healthcare workers (72 medical doctors and 73 nurses) were included in the final dataset. Participants were asked to provide sociodemographic and clinical information, and to complete: (a) quality of life and health-related Visual Analogue Scales, (b) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form Y1, (c) Beck Depression Inventory, and (d) PTSD Checklist for DSM-5. A comparison between healthcare professionals working in COVID-19 wards and other units revealed that the former reported higher levels of both depressive symptoms and PTSS. Moreover, the results of regression analyses showed that in healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients, gender and marital status, and gender and age significantly predicted depressive symptoms and PTSS, respectively. Particularly, being female and not in a relationship were found to be associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms, whereas being female and older were found to be related to higher levels of PTSS. The current findings suggest that specific predisposing factors could identify healthcare workers who are at high risk of developing mental health symptoms when faced with COVID-19 patients.","Di Tella, Romeo, Benfante, Castelli","https://doi.org/10.1111/jep.13444","20200725","COVID-19 pandemic; depressive symptoms; healthcare workers; mental health; posttraumatic stress symptoms","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The downstream effects of COVID-19: a call for supporting family wellbeing in the NICU","Parents of NICU infants are a vulnerable population from a psychological perspective, and often experience high levels of acute stress, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. The added burden of the current SARS CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to exacerbate these issues, with potential implications for the wellbeing of infants and families in the short- and long-term. In this paper, we propose utilizing the stress contagion framework and consider how psychosocial stress can &quot;spill over&quot; into the parent-infant relationship domain, which can impact child development and family wellbeing longer term. As the effects of the pandemic will likely persist well beyond the acute stage, we offer advocacy points and general guidelines for healthcare professionals to consider in their quest to mitigate stress and build resilience in NICU families.","Erdei, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41372-020-0745-7","20200831","Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Family; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Male; Needs Assessment; Pandemics; Parents; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychosocial Support Systems; Risk Assessment; United States; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Well-being of Parents and Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A National Survey","As the coronavirus disease pandemic spread across the United States and protective measures to mitigate its impact were enacted, parents and children experienced widespread disruptions in daily life. Our objective with this national survey was to determine how the pandemic and mitigation efforts affected the physical and emotional well-being of parents and children in the United States through early June 2020. In June 2020, we conducted a national survey of parents with children age &lt;18 to measure changes in health status, insurance status, food security, use of public food assistance resources, child care, and use of health care services since the pandemic began. Since March 2020, 27% of parents reported worsening mental health for themselves, and 14% reported worsening behavioral health for their children. The proportion of families with moderate or severe food insecurity increased from 6% before March 2020 to 8% after, employer-sponsored insurance coverage of children decreased from 63% to 60%, and 24% of parents reported a loss of regular child care. Worsening mental health for parents occurred alongside worsening behavioral health for children in nearly 1 in 10 families, among whom 48% reported loss of regular child care, 16% reported change in insurance status, and 11% reported worsening food security. The coronavirus disease pandemic has had a substantial tandem impact on parents and children in the United States. As policy makers consider additional measures to mitigate the health and economic effects of the pandemic, they should consider the unique needs of families with children.","Patrick, Henkhaus, Zickafoose, Lovell, Halvorson, Loch, Letterie, Davis","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-016824","20200902",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How COVID-19 Is Testing and Evolving Our Communication Skills","The COVID-19 pandemic forced us, as health care professionals and members of the general public, to adapt. Simple things we take for granted have become more difficult. As pressures increased for health care professionals, conversations and decisions have become tougher. This brought the need to adapt working practices and find ways to continue providing compassionate patient-centred care remotely. In UK radiotherapy departments, radiation therapist (review radiographer)-led clinics moved to telephone-based clinics to reduce the time spent by patients in a hospital environment. This required setting up a &quot;virtual&quot; clinic room with patients by removing distractions and setting boundaries for the conversation. We have had to adapt our communication skills quickly as picking up on nonverbal cues is not possible through the phone. It can be challenging to understand feelings through the tone of a patient's voice and empathise accordingly. The pandemic has forced patients to slow down and really focus on themselves which has led to picking up physical and mental health changes earlier. This is one of the many positive outcomes that can be drawn from the pandemic. Although we have changed how we work, ultimately we are still here to help our patients.","Julka-Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmir.2020.06.008","20200730","COVID-19; cancer; communication; radiotherapy; review; telephone","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Grief and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults","In few periods in human history have bereavement and grief been on so many people's minds as they are today. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. Among other mental health problems, we will likely see an increase in prolonged grief disorder. In this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of COVID-19, especially among older persons. The authors suggest ways that might mitigate this emerging problem.","Goveas, Shear","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.021","20200731","Bereavement; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; acute grief; complicated grief; novel coronavirus disease 2019; older adults; prolonged grief disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Patient-reported Outcomes of Patients With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Epicenter of China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study","We aimed to analyze the psychological status in patients with breast cancer (BC) in the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with BC during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the psychological status of patients with BC,Â especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes, and metastaticÂ BC.","Juanjuan, Santa-Maria, Hongfang, Lingcheng, Pengcheng, Yuanbing, Yuyan, Zhongchun, Bo, Meng, Qingfeng, Feng, Yi, Shengrong, Xingrui, Chuang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003","20200730","Breast cancer; COVID-19; Epicenter; Psychological status","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Factors that Lessen the Impact of COVID-19 on the Self-Employment Intention of Business Administration and Economics' Students from Latin America","The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (Covid-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to the labor market. The pandemic has a devastating and disproportionate effect on young workers, their interest in entrepreneurship, and their mental health. Research is needed to develop evidence-based strategies to improve coping and reduce adverse psychological problems. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact that Covid-19 pandemic perception and psychological need satisfaction have on university students and their self-employment intention. In addition, we also analyzed the role of moderation played by psychological aspects. These psychological factors (i.e., Optimism and Proactiveness) can also improve young people's mental health and well-being. An explorative study (online survey) was conducted in March 2020 934 university students from Latin America. Regression analysis models were built to examine the relationships between Covid-19 pandemic perception, personality variables, and entrepreneurial intention. Mediation models, through the bootstrapping method, were performed to analyze the mediating role of proactiveness and optimism. Results indicate that students' perception of Covid-19 and psychological need satisfaction are associated with entrepreneurial intention. Additionally, the present study argues that proactiveness and optimism mediate these relationships. This study identifies psychological factors associated with a lower level of Covid-19 impact and that can be used for psychological interventions that result in an improvement in the mental health of these vulnerable groups during and after the Covid-19 pandemic. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","HernÃ¡ndez-SÃ¡nchez, Cardella, SÃ¡nchez-GarcÃ­a","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155293","20200821","Covid-19; entrepreneurial intention; mental health; optimism; proactiveness; psychological need satisfaction; well-being; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Economics; Employment; Female; Humans; Intention; Latin America; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Decrease in Ambient Fine Particulate Matter during COVID-19 Crisis and Corresponding Health Benefits in Seoul, Korea","Both domestic emissions and transported pollutants from neighboring countries affect the ambient fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentration of Seoul, Korea. Diverse measures to control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), such as social distancing and increased telecommuting in Korea and the stringent lockdown measures of China, may reduce domestic emissions and levels of transported pollutants, respectively. In addition, wearing a particulate-filtering respirator may have decreased the absolute PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure level for individuals. Therefore, this study estimated the acute health benefits of PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction and changes in public behavior during the COVID-19 crisis in Seoul, Korea. To calculate the mortality burden attributable to PM<sub>2.5</sub>, we obtained residents' registration data, mortality data, and air pollution monitoring data for Seoul from publicly available databases. Relative risks were derived from previous time-series studies. We used the attributable fraction to estimate the number of excessive deaths attributable to acute PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure during January to April, yearly, from 2016 to 2020, and the number of mortalities avoided from PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction and respirator use observed in 2020. The average PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration from January to April in 2020 (25.6 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup>) was the lowest in the last 5 years. At least -4.1 Î¼g/m<sup>3</sup> (95% CI: -7.2, -0.9) change in ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> in Seoul was observed in 2020 compared to the previous 4 years. Overall, 37.6 (95% CI: 32.6, 42.5) non-accidental; 7.0 (95% CI: 5.7, 8.4) cardiovascular; and 4.7 (95% CI: 3.4, 6.1) respiratory mortalities were avoided due to PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction in 2020. By considering the effects of particulate respirator, decreases of 102.5 (95% CI: 89.0, 115.9) non-accidental; 19.1 (95% CI: 15.6, 22.9) cardiovascular; and 12.9 (95% CI: 9.2, 16.5) respiratory mortalities were estimated. We estimated that 37 lives were saved due to the PM<sub>2.5</sub> reduction related to COVID-19 in Seoul, Korea. The health benefit may be greater due to the popular use of particulate-filtering respirators during the COVID-19 crisis. Future studies with daily mortality data are needed to verify our study estimates.","Han, Hong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17155279","20200821","COVID-19; Korea; health burden; lockdown; mortality; particulate matter; Betacoronavirus; Coal; Coronavirus Infections; Databases, Factual; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Seoul","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The aim of the study was to analyse the relationship between eating habits, mental and emotional mood. A survey was conducted online during social isolation, from 24 April to 18 May 2020, among the Italian population. A total of 602 interviewees were included in the data analysis. A high percentage of respondents experienced a depressed mood, anxious feelings, hypochondria and insomnia (61.3%, 70.4%, 46.2% and 52.2%). Almost half of the respondents felt anxious due to the fact of their eating habits, consumed comfort food and were inclined to increase food intake to feel better. Age was inversely related to dietary control (OR = 0.971, <i>p</i> = 0.005). Females were more anxious and disposed to comfort food than males (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19","<b>Introduction</b>: Vaccines and drugs for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 require robust evidence generated from clinical trials before they can be used. Decisions on how to apply non-pharmaceutical interventions such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing and travel restrictions should also be based on evidence. There are some experiential and mathematical modelling data for these interventions, but there is a lack of data on the social, ethical and behavioural aspects of these interventions in the literature. Therefore, our study aims to produce evidence to inform (non-pharmaceutical) interventions such as communications, quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, travel restrictions and other public health measures for the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods</b>: The study will be conducted in the United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand. We propose to conduct 600-1000 quantitative surveys and 25-35 qualitative interviews per country. Data collection will follow the following four themes: (1) Quarantine and self-isolation (2) social distancing and travel restrictions (3) wellbeing and mental health (4) information, misinformation and rumours. In light of limitations of travel and holding in-person meetings, we will primarily use online/remote methods for collecting data. Study participants will be adults who have provided informed consent from different demographic, socio-economic and risk groups. <b>Discussion</b>: At the time of the inception of the study, United Kingdom, Italy, Malaysia, Slovenia and Thailand have initiated strict public health measures and varying degrees of &quot;lockdowns&quot; to curb the pandemic. These public health measures will change in the coming weeks and months depending on the number of cases of COVID-19 in the respective countries.

"Risk factors associated with mental illness in hospital discharged patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11-22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.","Liu, Baumeister, Veilleux, Chen, Liu, Yue, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297","20200903","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; PTSD","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a longitudinal probability sample survey of the UK population","The potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population mental health is of increasing global concern. We examine changes in adult mental health in the UK population before and during the lockdown. In this secondary analysis of a national, longitudinal cohort study, households that took part in Waves 8 or 9 of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) panel, including all members aged 16 or older in April, 2020, were invited to complete the COVID-19 web survey on April 23-30, 2020. Participants who were unable to make an informed decision as a result of incapacity, or who had unknown postal addresses or addresses abroad were excluded. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Repeated cross-sectional analyses were done to examine temporal trends. Fixed-effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change compared with preceding trends. Waves 6-9 of the UKHLS had 53â€ˆ351 participants. Eligible participants for the COVID-19 web survey were from households that took part in Waves 8 or 9, and 17â€ˆ452 (41Â·2%) of 42â€ˆ330 eligible people participated in the web survey. Population prevalence of clinically significant levels of mental distress rose from 18Â·9% (95% CI 17Â·8-20Â·0) in 2018-19 to 27Â·3% (26Â·3-28Â·2) in April, 2020, one month into UK lockdown. Mean GHQ-12 score also increased over this time, from 11Â·5 (95% CI 11Â·3-11Â·6) in 2018-19, to 12Â·6 (12Â·5-12Â·8) in April, 2020. This was 0Â·48 (95% CI 0Â·07-0Â·90) points higher than expected when accounting for previous upward trends between 2014 and 2018. Comparing GHQ-12 scores within individuals, adjusting for time trends and significant predictors of change, increases were greatest in 18-24-year-olds (2Â·69 points, 95% CI 1Â·89-3Â·48), 25-34-year-olds (1Â·57, 0Â·96-2Â·18), women (0Â·92, 0Â·50-1Â·35), and people living with young children (1Â·45, 0Â·79-2Â·12). People employed before the pandemic also averaged a notable increase in GHQ-12 score (0Â·63, 95% CI 0Â·20-1Â·06). By late April, 2020, mental health in the UK had deteriorated compared with pre-COVID-19 trends. Policies emphasising the needs of women, young people, and those with preschool aged children are likely to play an important part in preventing future mental illness.

"Google searches for suicide and suicide risk factors in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which causes the COVID-19 respiratory illness, emerged in December of 2019 and has since spread globally. The dramatic lifestyle changes and stressors associated with this pandemic pose a threat to mental health and have the potential to exacerbate risk factors for suicide. We used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to assess Google Trends data representing searches in the United States for 18 terms related to suicide and known suicide risk factors following the emergence of COVID-19. Although the relative proportion of Google searches for suicide-related queries was lower than predicted during the early pandemic period, searches for the following queries representative of financial difficulty were dramatically elevated: &quot;I lost my job&quot; (226%; 95%CI, 120%-333%), &quot;laid off&quot; (1164%; 95%CI, 395%-1932%), &quot;unemployment&quot; (1238%; 95%CI, 560%-1915%), and &quot;furlough&quot; (5717%; 95%CI, 2769%-8665%). Searches for the Disaster Distress Helpline, which was promoted as a source of help for those impacted by COVID-19, were also remarkably elevated (3021%; 95%CI, 873%-5169%). Google searches for other queries representative of help-seeking and general mental health concerns were moderately elevated. It appears that some indices of suicidality have fallen in the United States in this early stage of the pandemic, but that COVID-19 may have caused an increase in suicide risk factors that could yield long-term increases in suicidality and suicide rates.","Halford, Lake, Gould","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236777","20200803","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Help-Seeking Behavior; Hotlines; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Search Engine; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Unemployment; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Knowledge, Concerns, and Behaviors of Individuals During the First Week of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Italy","At the beginning of a public health crisis, such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is important to collect information about people's knowledge, worries, and behaviors to examine their influence on quality of life and to understand individual characteristics associated with these reactions. Such information could help to guide health authorities in providing informed interventions and clear communications. To document the initial knowledge about COVID-19 and recommended health behaviors; to assess worries (ie, one's perception of the influence of the worries of others on oneself), social appraisal, and preventive behaviors, comparing respondents from areas under different movement restrictions during the first week after the outbreak; and to understand how worries, perceived risk, and preventive behaviors were associated with quality of life and individual characteristics among Italian adults. This convenience sample, nonprobablistic survey study recruited adult participants with a snowballing sampling method in any Italian region during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy from February 26, 2020, to March 4, 2020. Data were analyzed from March 5 to 12, 2020. Information was collected from citizens living in the quarantine zone (ie, red zone), area with restricted movements (ie, yellow zone), and COVID-19-free regions (ie, green zone). Levels of knowledge on the virus, contagion-related worries, social appraisal, and preventive behaviors were assessed with ratings of quality of life (measured using the Short Form Health Survey). Additionally, some individual characteristics that may be associated with worries and behaviors were assessed, including demographic characteristics, personality traits (measured using Big Five Inventory-10), perceived health control (measured using the internal control measure in the Health Locus of Control scale), optimism (measured using the Revised Life Orientation Test), and the need for cognitive closure (measured using the Need for Closure Scale). A total of 3109 individuals accessed the online questionnaire, and 2886 individuals responded to the questionnaire at least partially (mean [SD] age, 30.7 [13.2] years; 2203 [76.3%] women). Most participants were well informed about the virus characteristics and suggested behaviors, with a mean (SD) score of 77.4% (17.3%) correct answers. Quality of life was similar across the 3 zones (effect sizeâ€‰=â€‰0.02), but mental health was negatively associated with contagion-related worries (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.066), social appraisal (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.221), and preventive behaviors (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.066) in the yellow zone (R2â€‰=â€‰0.108). Social appraisal was also associated with reduced psychological well-being in the green zone (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.205; R2â€‰=â€‰0.121). In the yellow zone, higher worries were negatively correlated with emotional stability (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.165; R2â€‰=â€‰0.047). Emotional stability was also negatively associated with perceived susceptibility in the yellow (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.108; R2â€‰=â€‰0.040) and green (Î²â€‰=â€‰-0.170; R2â€‰=â€‰0.087) zones. Preventative behaviors and social appraisal were also associated with the need for cognitive closure in both yellow (preventive behavior: Î²â€‰=â€‰0.110; R2â€‰=â€‰0.023; social appraisal Î²â€‰=â€‰0.115; R2â€‰=â€‰0.104) and green (preventive behavior: Î²â€‰=â€‰0.174; R2â€‰=â€‰0.022; social appraisal: 0.261; R2â€‰=â€‰0.137) zones. These findings suggest that during the first week of the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy, people were well informed and had a relatively stable level of worries. Quality of life did not vary across the areas, although mental well-being was challenged by the social appraisal and worries related to the contagion. Increased scores for worries and concerns were associated with more cognitive rigidity and emotional instability.","Pagnini, Bonanomi, Tagliabue, Balconi, Bertolotti, Confalonieri, Di Dio, Gilli, Graffigna, Regalia, Saita, Villani","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.15821","20200810","Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Female; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Italy; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Hence, the Malaysian government announced a Movement Control Order at the start of the containment phase to flatten the epidemiological curve. Universiti Malaysia Sabah (UMS), a public university in Borneo, was accelerated into alert phase because of high risk of case importation from more than 400 China incoming undergraduates. Measures to mitigate the potential COVID-19 outbreaks in its population were taken by using conventional public health measures with special attention to task-shifting and widespread community mental health interventions. A Preparedness and Response Centre was established to overseer the mitigating measures happening inside the university. Measures taken included empowerment of frontline staff, strengthening of restrictions, strengthening university health center, vigorous contact tracing, widespread health education, maintaining cultural sensitivity, and establishment of early standard operating procedures and university continuity plans. Hence, UMS was able to ensure no importation of cases into its campus during both acute and containment phases at the nationwide level.","Mukhsam, Jeffree, Pang, Syed Abdul Rahim, Omar, Abdullah, Lukman, Giloi, Salvaraji, Abd Karim, Saupin, Boon Tat, Mohd Hayati, Ibrahim, Muhamad, Zainudin","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0458","20200728",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

To describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemic in a cohort of Italian psoriatic patients treated with biologics. A telephone survey was conducted in May 4-10 2020 about the Italian lockdown period (March 9-May 3 2020) in a cohort of psoriatic patients treated with biologics, asking about any exposure to COVID-19, disease status, continuation of therapy, work activity and psychological status through Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). 226 patients were interviewed, with no COVID-19 positive cases. Sixty-three of 226 (27.9%) described worsening of the disease with a correlation to drug withdrawal [43/226 (19%)]. Correlation was also found between the worsening of psoriasis and HADS anxiety, HADS depression, BRS and PSS abnormal scores considered both as categorical and continuous variables. No correlation was found between worsening of psoriasis and work activity. Uncertainty about whether biologics could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection led to drug withdrawal with subsequent worsening of psoriasis. Moreover, psychological status also had a direct influence on the clinical course of the disease.","Pirro, Caldarola, Chiricozzi, Tambone, Mariani, Calabrese, D'Urso, De Simone, Peris","https://doi.org/10.1080/09546634.2020.1800578","20200804","COVID-19; Psoriasis; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; biological therapies; depression; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The health and social consequences of the pandemic may exacerbate substance misuse and poor management of HIV among this population. This study compares substance use and HIV care before and during the pandemic using data collected weekly through an opioid relapse prevention and HIV management mobile-health intervention. We found that during the pandemic, PLWH and SUD have increased illicit substance use and contact with other substance-using individuals and decreased their confidence to stay sober and attend recovery meetings. The proportion of people missing their HIV medications also increased, and confidence to attend HIV follow-up appointments decreased. Optimal support for PLWH and SUD is critical during pandemics like COVID-19, as drug-related and HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence risks such as overdose, unsafe sexual behaviors, and transmission of infectious diseases may unfold.","Hochstatter, Akhtar, Dietz, Pe-Romashko, Gustafson, Shah, Krechel, Liebert, Miller, El-Bassel, Westergaard","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-02976-1","20200809","COVID-19; HIV; Mobile-health intervention; Substance use disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health issues impacting pharmacists during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) impact on the mental health of healthcare workers is extremely detrimental. It is imperative that the psychological health of all healthcare workers be protected. However, an often overlooked member of the healthcare frontline is the pharmacist. Pharmacists provide many types of essential services during the pandemic, which often cannot be done from a remote location. Being frontline healthcare workers, pharmacists have experienced an increase in the number of patients seen, the amount of screening and triage being done, the amount of COVID-19 information being delivered, the number of medication shortages, and the amount of workplace harassment taking place. These activities increase the amount of stress, burden, and frustration felt by pharmacists have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being. This article seeks to address the specific implications of COVID-19 on the mental health of pharmacists.","Elbeddini, Wen, Tayefehchamani, To","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40545-020-00252-0","20200725","COVID-19; Mental health; Pharmacists","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This review article included 10 studies. The seven studies before onset of COVID 19 about psychological impact of quarantine in children have reported isolation, social exclusion stigma and fear among the children. The most common diagnoses were acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder, grief, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Three studies during the COVID-19 pandemic reported restlessness, irritability, anxiety, clinginess and inattention with increased screen time in children during quarantine. These adverse consequences can be tackled through carefully formulated multilevel interventions.","Imran, Aamer, Sharif, Bodla, Naveed","https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.36.5.3088","20200725","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Mental health; Quarantine; Stigma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p&lt;0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p&lt;0.05).

"The relationship between resilience, anxiety and depression among patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study","To explore the role of resilience in anxiety and depression and to clarify their relationships among patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively affected some individuals, but resilience plays a decisive role in the response of individuals under pressure and can help them deal with pressure more effectively. The cross-sectional descriptive correlational survey was reported in line with the STROBE guidelines. In total, 296 patients from FangCang Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China, with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were recruited. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. The data collected included their demographic information, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A small number of patients in this study had above threshold anxiety (subthreshold anxiety and major anxiety) and depression (subthreshold depression and major depression). The mean total resilience score of the participants was slightly below the normal level of ordinary Chinese adults. Resilience was inversely associated with and was a protective factor for both anxiety and depression in our samples. Risk factors for anxiety include being female and having colleagues with COVID-19, while a risk factor for depression was having family members with COVID-19. This study shows that after taking the general demographics into consideration, higher levels of resilience were associated with lower anxiety and depression among mild COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Health professionals, especially clinical nurses, need to be aware of the psychological status of COVID-19 patients and promote resilience to improve their mental health.","Zhang, Yang, Wang, Li, Dong, Wang, Li, Wei, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15425","20200821","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Students under lockdown: Comparisons of students' social networks and mental health before and during the COVID-19 crisis in Switzerland","This study investigates students' social networks and mental health before and at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, using longitudinal data collected since 2018. We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elmer, Mepham, Stadtfeld","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236337","20200803","Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation; Social Networking; Stress, Psychological; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Switzerland; Universities","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 lockdown impact on lifestyle habits of Italian adults","In March 2020, when the Government imposed nation-wide lockdown measures to contrast the COVID-19 outbreak, the life of Italians suddenly changed. In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on lifestyle habits and behavioral risk factors of the general adult population in Italy, we set up the Lost in Italy (LOckdown and lifeSTyles IN ITALY) project. Within this project, the online panel of Doxa was used to conduct a web-based cross-sectional study during the first phase of the lockdown, on a large representative sample of adults aged 18-74 years (N=6003). The self-administered questionnaire included information on lifestyle habits and perceived physical and mental health, through the use of validated scales. As we are working within the Lost in Italy project, we got two additional grants to further research on the medium-term impact of lockdown, a topic of great interest and with anticipated large socio-economic and public health implications. In details: we obtained by the AXA Research Fund support to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical, mental, and social wellbeing of elderly and fragile populations in the Lombardy region, the area most heavily hit by the pandemic in the country. Moreover, as a fruitful integration, we obtained support by the Directorate General for Welfare of the region to assess health services delivery and access to healthcare in the same study population, combining an analysis of administrative databases with an economic analysis.

"Post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic: depicting chronicity of a new disease","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak is posing considerable challenges to healthcare systems and societies worldwide. While the knowledge on the acute phase of the disease has rapidly expanded, little is known on the consequences of COVID-19 following clinical remission. We set up a multidisciplinary COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID-19 survivors. Here we describe the features of our follow-up programme. The multidisciplinary assessment comprises a complete physical examination, respiratory evaluation (peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, dyspnoea assessment, lung ultrasound and pulmonary function), cardiovascular assessment (electrocardiography, echocardiography), nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, mini Nutritional Assessment screening tool), neurological examination including cognitive tests, and mental health assessment. All data are prospectively collected, and blood is sampled for biobanking. Since 7 April to 5 June, 2020, 453 out of the 1388 COVID-19 survivors managed at our University Hospital have been evaluated at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic. The characteristics of the follow-up cohort are similar to those of the whole cohort of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity upon ED presentation, indicating that the follow-up cohort is representative of the whole cohort. Continuous patient monitoring might give an answer to the numerous unsolved questions about what comes next in this pandemic and beyond.

"What Media Helps, What Media Hurts: A Mixed Methods Survey Study of Coping with COVID-19 Using the Media Repertoire Framework and the Appraisal Theory of Stress","Social and physical distancing in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has made screen-mediated information and communication technologies (media) indispensable. Whether an increase in screen use is a source of or a relief for stress remains to be seen. In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns, we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media use. Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesize that individual differences in the appraisal of media predict variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. Between March 20 and April 20, 2020, a brief snowball survey entitled: &quot;What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens&quot; was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media repertoire method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in use, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, and ignore) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media use by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender, and self-reported mental health. More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the United States. From 685 completed responses, 169 respondents were &quot;very stressed&quot; and 452 were &quot;slightly worried&quot; about the pandemic. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>=11.76, P=.008), television (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>=12.40, P=.006), YouTube (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>=8.577, P=.04), and streaming services such as Netflix (Ï‡<sup>2</sup><sub>3</sub>=10.71, P=.01). Respondents who considered their mental health &quot;not good&quot; were twice as likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and nonbinary respondents were twice as likely than men to pick social media for coping. Individuals younger than 35 years were 3 times more likely to pick computer games, and individuals older than 55 years were more likely to pick network television or print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (less in men than others) in terms of avoid (F<sub>1,637</sub>=5.84, P=.02) and approach scores (F<sub>1,637</sub>=14.31, P&lt;.001). Subjective mental health affected the ignore score (less in those who said &quot;good&quot; than others; F<sub>1,637</sub>=13.88, P&lt;.001). The appraisal score and use increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) were important for coping if they provided support and connection through the dissemination of factual and positive information while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. The media repertoire approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pahayahay, Khalili-Mahani","https://doi.org/10.2196/20186","20200814","COVID-19; Netflix; coping; infodemic; infodemiology; information and communication technologies; media; social network; stress; survey; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Female; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Male; Mass Media; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Models, Psychological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Screen Time; Social Media; Social Networking; Surveys and Questionnaires; Television; Video Games; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Puppy love in the time of Corona: Dog ownership protects against loneliness for those living alone during the COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries enforcing a 'lockdown', whereby people are instructed to stay at home. The aim of this study was to capture the experience of such a lockdown in Australians living alone, with and without a dog or a cat. Three hundred and eighty-four participants completed an online survey evaluating their levels of loneliness, mindfulness and mood. For participants who owned a dog or a cat, a measure of dog/cat interactions was also administered as well as two open-ended questions about how being a pet owner affected their experience of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affected their pet. Contrary to expectations, cat owners were found to be less mindful than non-owners and pet interactions did not account for levels of loneliness or levels of mindfulness. In line with our expectations, however, stress and depression positively predicted loneliness, while mindfulness and being a dog owner were protective against it. Insights from qualitative responses suggest that this might be due to the fact that dogs encourage a routine which involves getting out of the house and walking, which itself offers opportunities to socialise with other people doing the same thing. These findings add to the emerging literature on mental well-being during a lockdown and the unique role that pets play in their owners' experiences.","Oliva, Johnston","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020944195","20200729","COVID-19; cat; dog; loneliness; mindfulness; pet","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

"Applying relationship science to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact couples' relationships","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered people's daily lives and created multiple societal challenges. One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

"Planning for the Post-COVID Syndrome: How Payers Can Mitigate Long-Term Complications of the Pandemic","As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, payers across the USA have stepped up to alleviate patients' financial burden by waiving cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing and treatment. However, there has been no substantive discussion of potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on patient health or their financial and policy implications. After recovery, patients remain at risk for lung disease, heart disease, frailty, and mental health disorders. There may also be long-term sequelae of adverse events that develop in the course of COVID-19 and its treatment. These complications are likely to place additional medical, psychological, and economic burdens on all patients, with lower-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, and individuals experiencing homelessness being most vulnerable. Thus, there needs to be a comprehensive plan for preventing and managing post-COVID-19 complications to quell their clinical, economic, and public health consequences and to support patients experiencing delayed morbidity and disability as a result.","Jiang, McCoy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06042-3","20200725","COVID-19; access to care; cost-sharing; underinsured; uninsured","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Debunking Cannabidiol as a Treatment for COVID-19: Time for the FDA to Adopt a Focused Deterrence Model?","Many cannabidiol (CBD) retailers make unsupported medical claims about their product. In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent warning letters to CBD retailers who promoted CBD to treat Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, and other serious conditions for which there is no evidence of its efficacy as a treatment or preventive. Compliance with these warning letters has been low. During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the FDA has begun sending more strongly worded warning letters that appear to have better compliance in that most of these companies have removed COVID-19-related claims. However, many continue to present other unsupported medical claims on other serious medical conditions like cancer, depression, addiction, and bone fractures, among many others. We argue that adopting a strategy of focused deterrence where the FDA prioritizes enforcement related to COVID-19 claims - but when COVID-19-related claims are found, pursues all other violations by that company - would present an opportunity to efficiently cut down on harmful claims overstating CBD's benefits.","Shover, Humphreys","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8671","20200724","cannabidiol; cannabis; covid-19; food and drug administration; health policy; regulation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Going digital: how technology use may influence human brains and behaviorâ€©","The digital revolution has changed, and continues to change, our world and our lives. Currently, major aspects of our lives have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic, and social distancing has necessitated virtual togetherness. In a synopsis of 10 articles we present ample evidence that the use of digital technology may influence human brains and behavior in both negative and positive ways. For instance, brain imaging techniques show concrete morphological alterations in early childhood and during adolescence that are associated with intensive digital media use. Technology use apparently affects brain functions, for example visual perception, language, and cognition. Extensive studies could not confirm common concerns that excessive screen time is linked to mental health problems, or the deterioration of well-being. Nevertheless, it is important to use digital technology consciously, creatively, and sensibly to improve personal and professional relationships. Digital technology has great potential for mental health assessment and treatment, and the improvement of personal mental performance.â€©.

En una sinopsis de 10 artÃ­culos, se presenta una amplia evidencia de que el empleo de la tecnologÃ­a digital puede influir en el cerebro y en el comportamiento humano de manera negativa y positiva. Por ejemplo, las tÃ©cnicas de imÃ¡genes cerebrales muestran alteraciones morfolÃ³gicas concretas en la primera infancia y durante la adolescencia, las cuales estÃ¡n asociadas con el empleo intenso de medios digitales.

"[Impact of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) on the mental health of healthcare professionals: a systematic review]","In times of this global pandemic situation, population's mental health is compromised, especially in those groups that are at the forefront of defence against the virus such as healthcare professionals. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on healthcare professionals' mental health. A systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA format in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect electronic databases between January and May 2020. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for non-randomized studies. A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Professionals' mental health and mental functions were compromised, being especially affected those professionals on the front line of battle against the virus. However, these stats were below the general population data. Although there is wide variability of results, medium-high levels of anxiety (26,5%-44,6%), depression (8,1%-25%), concern and insomnia are detected (23,6%-38%). Paradoxically, stress levels were below expectations (3,8%-68,3%).

"No clear association emerges between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 fatality rates from macro-level analyses","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 originated in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread in more than 100 countries. Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus and deaths from the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. Our aim is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and spread and lethality of COVID-19 in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support these links. In fact, despite a higher prevalence of intergenerational coresidence and contacts that is broadly positively associated with COVID-19 case fatality rates at the country level, the opposite is generally true at the subnational level. While this inconsistent evidence demonstrates neither the existence nor the absence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the severity of COVID-19, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data, which suffer from many shortcomings. We conclude by arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. Theoretically, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and &quot;phase-2&quot; restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.","Arpino, Bordone, Pasqualini","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008581117","20200828","COVID-19; coresidence; coronavirus; intergenerational contacts; intergenerational relationships; Coronavirus Infections; Europe; Humans; Intergenerational Relations; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Consensus on Recommendations for Safe Sexual Activity during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic","Sexual activity offers numerous advantages for physical and mental health but maintains inherent risks in a pandemic situation, such as the current one caused by SARS-CoV-2. A group of experts from the Spanish Association of Sexuality and Mental Health (AESexSAME) has reached a consensus on recommendations to maintain lower-risk sexual activity, depending on one's clinical and partner situations, based on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2. Different situations are included in the recommendations: a sexual partner passing quarantine without any symptoms, a sexual partner that has not passed quarantine, a sexual partner with some suspicious symptoms of COVID-19, a positive sexual partner with COVID-19, a pregnant sexual partner, a health professional partner in contact with COVID-19 patients, and people without a sexual partner. The main recommendations include returning to engaging in safe sex after quarantine is over (28 days based on the duration one can carry SARS-CoV-2, or 33 days for those who are &gt;60 years old) and all parties are asymptomatic. In all other cases (for those under quarantine, those with some clinical symptoms, health professionals in contact with COVID-19 patients, and during pregnancy), abstaining from coital/oral/anal sex, substituting it with masturbatory or virtual sexual activity to provide maximum protection from the contagion, and increasing the benefits inherent to sexual activity are recommended. For persons without a partner, not initiating sexual activity with a sporadic partner is strongly recommended.","Cabello, SÃ¡nchez, FarrÃ©, Montejo","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072297","20200814","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; consensus; recommendations; sexual activity; sexual risk","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Symptoms in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Epidemic A Cross-Sectional Survey","In March-April 2020, the Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic suddenly hit Italian healthcare facilities and in some of them many staff members became infected. In this work 595 health care workers from a public company were tested for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (82 positive) and asked to complete a questionnaire on early COVID-19 symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were present in 56.1% of cases. Anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 cases were found to have an odds ratio (OR) = 100.7 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 26.5-382.6) and an OR = 51.8 (95%CI 16.6-161.9), respectively. About one in three of the cases (29.3%) never manifested symptoms. Anxiety was reported by 16.6% of COVID-19 cases and depression by 20.3%, with a significant increase in the estimated risk (OR = 4.3; 95%CI = 2.4-7.4 for anxiety, OR = 3.5; 95%CI = 2.0-6.0 for depression). In cases, sleep was a significant moderating factor in the relationship between occupational stress, or organizational justice, and anxiety. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 in health care workers, must consider, in addition to respiratory disorders and fever, anosmia, dysgeusia, exhaustion, myalgias and enteric disorders. The frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in the population examined was not higher than that commonly recorded in the same company during periodic checks in the years preceding the epidemic. In COVID-19 cases there was a significant risk of anxiety, especially in those who had low sleep quality. Mental health support and improvement interventions must mainly concern workers with positive tests and should also tend to improve sleep quality.","Magnavita, Tripepi, Di Prinzio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145218","20200821","anosmia; anxiety; depression; dysgeusia; effort/reward imbalance; occupational disease; occupational epidemiology; occupational stress; organizational justice; sleep quality; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Organizational Culture; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Panic and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people: An online pilot survey early in the outbreak","Precisely how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health worldwide is currently poorly understood. The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Islam, Ferdous, Potenza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.049","20200904","Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; General population; Panic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Electroconvulsive therapy protocol adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, electroconvulsive therapy units have had to confront challenges such as the infectious hazard due to aerosol-generating ventilation, or the lack of staff and material resources. Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital ClÃ­nic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations' guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. The protocol includes the following main areas: (1) ECT unit's structural and functional considerations; (2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; (3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); (4) management of COVID-19 cases; and (5) protocol assessment. The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the cancer care of adolescents and young adults and their well-being: Results from an online survey conducted in the early stages of the pandemic","Because of the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), oncology departments across the world have rapidly adapted their cancer care protocols to balance the risk of delaying cancer treatments and the risk of COVID-19 exposure. COVID-19 and associated changes may have an impact on the psychosocial functioning of patients with cancer and survivors. This study was designed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people living with and beyond cancer. In this cross-sectional study, 177 individuals, aged 18 to 39 years, were surveyed about the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer care and psychological well-being. Participants also reported their information needs with respect to COVID-19. Responses were summarized with a content analysis approach. This was the first study to examine the psychological functioning of young patients and survivors during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. A third of the respondents reported increased levels of psychological distress, and as many as 60% reported feeling more anxious than they did before COVID-19. More than half also wanted more information tailored to them as young patients with cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and changing the landscape of cancer care. Young people living with cancer are a unique population and might be more vulnerable during this time in comparison with their healthy peers. There is a need to screen for psychological distress and attend to young people whose cancer care has been delayed.

"Medication treatment for opioid use disorder and community pharmacy: Expanding care during a national epidemic and global pandemic","Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone and buprenorphine, are effective strategies for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and reducing overdose risk. MOUD treatment rates continue to be low across the US, and currently, some evidence suggests access to evidence-based treatment is becoming increasingly difficult for those with OUD as a result of the 2019 novel corona virus (COVID-19). A major underutilized source to address these serious challenges in the US is community pharmacy given the specialized training of pharmacists, high levels of consumer trust, and general availability for accessing these service settings. Canadian, Australian, and European pharmacists have made important contributions to the treatment and care of those with OUD over the past decades. Unfortunately, US pharmacists are not permitted to prescribe MOUD and are only currently allowed to dispense methadone for the treatment of pain, not OUD. US policymakers, regulators, and practitioners must work to facilitate this advancement of community pharmacy-based through research, education, practice, and industry. Advancing community pharmacy-based MOUD for leading clinical management of OUD and dispensation of treatment medications will afford the US a critical innovation for addressing the opioid epidemic, fallout from COVID-19, and getting individuals the care they need.","Cochran, Bruneau, Cox, Gordon","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1787300","20200730","COVID-19; Community pharmacy; Medication for opioid use disorder; Analgesics, Opioid; Australia; Betacoronavirus; Buprenorphine; Canada; Community Pharmacy Services; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Methadone; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pharmacists; Pneumonia, Viral; Scope of Practice; United Kingdom; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Reckoning With the Relation Between Stressors and Suicide Attempts in a Time of Covid-19","The Covid-19 pandemic presents a unique set of risk exposures to populations, which may lead to an increase in suicide. While large-scale traumatic events are known to increase psychological disorders, thus far the science has not shown a clear link between these events and suicide. In their paper in this issue, Elbogen and colleagues (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;(XX):XXXX-XXXX) use representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to show that four dimensions of financial strain-financial debt/crisis, unemployment, past homelessness, lower income-are associated with subsequent suicide attempts. There are three main learnings we may take from Elbogen et al: first, with populations facing record-breaking unemployment, economic recession, and reduced wages, we can anticipate an increase in suicide in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, these data show the centrality of financial stressors, marking the current moment as distinct from other disasters or large-scale trauma. Third, the data teach us that financial stressors are linked, and cumulative. In this way, the paper is a sobering harbinger of the potential effects on suicide of the collective stressors borne by the Covid-19 pandemic and other mass traumatic events that are accompanied by substantial financial stressors.","Ettman, Gradus, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa147","20200901","economic recession; financial stressors; mental health; suicide; trauma; unemployment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"HIV and SARS-CoV-2: Intersecting Epidemics with Many Unknowns","As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question. Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a &quot;risk factor&quot; for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts; and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, mental health disorders, and other structural vulnerabilities, which may increase their risk of COVID-19. In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions impact secondary health outcomes, and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e.g., telemedicine).","Lesko, Bengtson","https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa158","20200901","COVID-19; Engagement in care; HIV; Mental health; Substance use; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Chronic Neurology in COVID-19 Era: Clinical Considerations and Recommendations From the REPROGRAM Consortium","With the rapid pace and scale of the emerging coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a growing body of evidence has shown a strong association of COVID-19 with pre- and post- neurological complications. This has necessitated the need to incorporate targeted neurological care for this subgroup of patients which warrants further reorganization of services, healthcare workforce, and ongoing management of chronic neurological cases. The social distancing and the shutdown imposed by several nations in the midst of COVID-19 have severely impacted the ongoing care, access and support of patients with chronic neurological conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Neuromuscular Disorders, Migraine, Dementia, and Parkinson disease. There is a pressing need for governing bodies including national and international professional associations, health ministries and health institutions to harmonize policies, guidelines, and recommendations relating to the management of chronic neurological conditions. These harmonized guidelines should ensure patient continuity across the spectrum of hospital and community care including the well-being, safety, and mental health of the patients, their care partners and the health professionals involved. This article provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of COVID-19 on chronic neurological conditions and specific recommendations to minimize the potential harm to those at high risk.","Bhaskar, Bradley, Israeli-Korn, Menon, Chattu, Thomas, Chawla, Kumar, Prandi, Ray, Golla, Surya, Yang, Martinez, Ozgen, Codrington, GonzÃ¡lez, Toosi, Hariya Mohan, Menon, Chahidi, Mederer Hengstl","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00664","20200723","chronic neurological disease; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); guidelines; healthcare services; neurodegenerative disorders; pandemics; protocols; recommendations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Canadian adolescents (nÂ = 1,054, M<sub>age</sub>Â = 16.68, standard deviationÂ = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3Â weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","Dumas, Ellis, Litt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200826","Adolescent; Alcohol; COVID-19; Cannabis; Substance use; Vaping; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Alcoholism; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Marijuana Abuse; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Social Distance; Substance-Related Disorders; Vaping","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei","In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to clarify the epidemiology, laboratory examinations, imaging findings, and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei province, China. In this retrospective study, the demographic, laboratory and imaging, and treatment data of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in 13 designated hospitals in Hebei were collected and analyzed. A total of 319 severe COVID-19 patients were treated at the 13 designated hospitals between 22 January, 2020 and 25 March, 2020. Eventually, 51 critically ill (31 severe cases and 20 critically severe cases) patients were included in the analysis. The patients had an average age of 58.9Â±13.7 years, and 27 (52.9%) were men. Twenty-one (41.2%) were familial cluster, and 33 (64.7%) had chronic illnesses. The patients in critically severe group had longer duration from symptom to confirmation, more severe infections, more severe lung injury, and a lower percentage of lymphocytes. All 51 patients received antiviral drugs, 47 (92.2%) received antibacterial agents, 49 (96.1%) received traditional Chinese drugs, and 46 (90.2%) received methylprednisolone. The critically severe patients received more fluid and more diuretic treatment; 14 (70.0%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 13 (65.0%) developed extrapulmonary complications. COVID-19 patients who had underlying diseases and longer confirmation times were more likely to progress to critically severe COVID-19.

"Associations between COVID-19 related media consumption and symptoms of anxiety, depression and COVID-19 related fear in the general population in Germany","In context of the current COVID-19 pandemic the consumption of pandemic-related media coverage may be an important factor that is associated with anxiety and psychological distress. Aim of the study was to examine those associations in the general population in Germany. 6233 participants took part in an online-survey (March 27th-April 6th, 2020), which included demographic information and media exploitation in terms of duration, frequency and types of media. Symptoms of depression, unspecific anxiety and COVID-19 related anxiety were ascertained with standardized questionnaires. Frequency, duration and diversity of media exposure were positively associated with more symptoms of depression and unspecific and COVID-19 specific anxiety. We obtained the critical threshold of seven times per day and 2.5Â h of media exposure to mark the difference between mild and moderate symptoms of (un)specific anxiety and depression. Particularly the usage of social media was associated with more pronounced psychological strain. Participants with pre-existing fears seem to be particularly vulnerable for mental distress related to more immoderate media consumption. Our findings provide some evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related media exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations-especially with regard to the thresholds of critical media usage.","Bendau, Petzold, Pyrkosch, Mascarell Maricic, Betzler, Rogoll, GroÃŸe, StrÃ¶hle, Plag","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01171-6","20200724","Corona; Media coverage; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: a UK-based focus group study","This study explored UK public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised five focus groups, carried out online during the early stages of the UK's stay at home order ('lockdown'), and analysed using a thematic approach. Focus groups took place via online videoconferencing. Participants (n=27) were all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. Qualitative analysis revealed four main themes: (1) loss-participants' loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine led to psychological and emotional 'losses' such as loss of motivation, loss of meaning and loss of self-worth; (2) criticisms of government communication-participants reported a lack of trust in government and a lack of clarity in the guidelines around social distancing and isolation; (3) adherence-participants reported high self-adherence to social distancing guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others; (4) uncertainty around social reintegration and the future-some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity.Most participants, and particularly those in low-paid or precarious employment, reported feeling that the social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had negative impacts on their mental health and well-being during the early stages of the UK's 'lockdown'. A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","Williams, Armitage, Tampe, Dienes","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039334","20200730","mental health; public health; qualitative research; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Female; Focus Groups; Government; Humans; Income; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Policy; Qualitative Research; Social Isolation; Trust; United Kingdom; Videoconferencing; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: a scoping review","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to 198 countries, with approximately 2.4 million confirmed cases and 150,000 deaths globally as of April 18. Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) face a substantially higher risk of infection and death due to excessive COVID-19 exposure. This review aimed at summarizing the evidence of the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers (HCWs). We used the Arksey O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. A systematic literature search was conducted using two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. We found 154 studies, and out of which 10 met our criteria. We collected information on the date of publication, first author's country, the title of the article, study design, study population, intervention and outcome, and key findings, and divided all research articles into two domains: physical and mental health impact. We reviewed a total of 154 articles from PubMed (126) and Google Scholar (28), of which 58 were found to be duplicate articles and were excluded. Of the remaining 96 articles, 82 were excluded after screening for eligibility, and 4 articles did not have available full texts. Ten full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study. Our findings identified the following risk factors for COVID-19-related health impact: working in a high-risk department, diagnosed family member, inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, improper PPE use, close contact with patients (â‰¥ 12 times/day), long daily contact hours (â‰¥ 15 h), and unprotected exposure. The most common symptoms identified amongst HCWs were fever (85%), cough (70%), and weakness (70%). Prolonged PPE usage led to cutaneous manifestations and skin damage (97%), with the nasal bridge (83%) most commonly affected site. HCWs experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Female HCWs and nurses were disproportionately affected. The frontline healthcare workers are at risk of physical and mental consequences directly as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19. Even though there are few intervention studies, early data suggest implementation strategies to reduce the chances of infections, shorter shift lengths, and mechanisms for mental health support could reduce the morbidity and mortality amongst HCWs.","Shaukat, Ali, Razzak","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-020-00299-5","20200724","COVID-19; Health impacts; Healthcare workers; Occupational health; Risk factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"[Adjustment Disorder, Depression, Stress Symptoms, Corona Related Anxieties and Coping Strategies during the Corona Pandemic (COVID-19) in Swiss Medical Staff]","International studies point to increased mental health problems of medical staff during the Corona pandemic (COVID-19). This is the first study to investigate mental health, i.â€‰e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too.

"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5Â years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Tisler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","20200723","COVID-19; Cancer; Cardiovascular diseases; Global health; Health burden; Infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (pÂ &lt;Â .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(pÂ &lt;Â .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Alrashed, Alzunaydi, Almohimeed, Aljohani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152192","20200903","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; IES; Knowledge; Pandemic; Precaution; Psychological impact; Saudi Arabia; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Preexisting Comorbidities Predicting COVID-19 and Mortality in the UK Biobank Community Cohort","Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be older and frequently have hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart disease (CHD), but whether these co-morbidities are true risk factors (i.e. more common than in the general older population) is unclear. We estimated associations between pre-existing diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality, in a large community cohort. UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (16th March to 26th April 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. Of 269,070 participants aged 65+, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common co-morbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%) and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age-group, sex, ethnicity and education, pre-existing diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, COPD, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first five remaining statistically significant for related mortality.

"Techniques, Methods, and Dissemination of Community-Based Psychological Support Strategies in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic","In times of the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 psychological support needs to meet certain requirements. Due to the lockdown in many countries of the world, the every-day activities of millions of people are reduced to a minimum. This may cause increased psychosomatic symptoms in persons with pre-existing mental illnesses, and additionally raises new challenges for the general population. As a result of the current contact restrictions, access to psychotherapy is further complicated. To guarantee the best possible care under the given conditions, we developed the CoPE (Coping with Corona: Extended Psychosomatic care in Essen) concept. CoPE is delivered by telephone or video calls as well as online contents. The materials presented at our webpage www.cope-corona.de aim to easily reach citizens affected by symptoms such as worries, depression or anger and let them receive readily understandable expert knowledge and training in basic self-help methods.","Benecke, BÃ¤uerle, Jansen, Schneider, DÃ¶rrie, Teufel, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720943328","20200722","coronavirus; mental health; psychological support strategies; self-help strategies; Adaptation, Psychological; Community Mental Health Services; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Self-Management; Social Support; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Impact of Quarantine on Caregivers at a Children's Hospital for Contact with Case of COVID-19","Quarantine often provokes negative psychological consequences. Thus, we aimed to identify the psychological and behavioral responses and stressors of caregivers quarantined with young patients after a close contact to a coronavirus disease 2019 case at a children's hospital. More than 90% of the caregivers reported feelings of worry and nervousness, while some of them reported suicidal ideations (4.2%), and/or homicidal ideations (1.4%). Fear of infection of the patient (91.7%) and/or oneself (86.1%) were most frequently reported stressors. A multidisciplinary team including infection control team, pediatrician, psychiatrist, nursing staff and legal department provided supplies and services to reduce caregiver's psychological distress. Psychotropic medication was needed in five (6.9%), one of whom was admitted to the psychiatry department due to suicidality. Quarantine at a children's hospital makes notable psychological impacts on the caregivers and a multidisciplinary approach is required.","Kim, Park, Shin, Lee, Chung, Lee, Kim, Jung, Lee, Yum, Lee, Koh, Ko, Lim, Lee, Lee, Choi, Han, Shin, Lee, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e255","20200727","COVID-19; Caregivers; Psychological Response; Stressor; Anxiety; Caregivers; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Debate: Exposing the most serious infirmity - racism's impact on health in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic retells a story that other diseases like HIV, diabetes, and cancer have clearly internationally illustrated. Minorities in developed countries across the globe - especially those of African, Hispanic, and Native American descent - suffer a greater burden of disease than whites. The evidence of the cause and effect relationship of racism on mental and minority health outcomes is staggering. Racism and its influence on policy and important structural systems allow health inequities across racial and ethnic groups to persist. What's more troubling is how systemic racism impacts children from all races and has been perpetuated across many generations dating back hundreds of years. The impact of racial oppression is seen through intergenerational trauma which impacts youth in varying ways. For this article, we offer three areas in which racism causes healthcare disparities, intergenerational trauma, social determinants, and cultural mistrust. Effective policy change and a greater level of accountability must be placed on major systems including health care, to most fully counter racism's varied role in sustaining mental health inequities.","Farquharson, Thornton","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12407","20200827","African Americans; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Healthcare Disparities; Hispanic Americans; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Racism; Social Determinants of Health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Exploring COVID-19 stress and its factors in Bangladesh: A perception-based study","The COVID-19 pandemic has aggregated mental health sufferings throughout the entire world. Suicide completions are the extreme consequences of COVID-19 related psychological burdens, which was reported in many countries including Bangladesh. However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its' associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 Â± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents' perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country. Considering the present findings, it is essential to introduce time-oriented policy, and implement care monitoring plans in the country, which may help in managing the pandemic as well as nurturing the public mental health to combat COVID-19 related psychological challenges.","Islam, Bodrud-Doza, Khan, Haque, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04399","20200903","Bangladeshi people; COVID-19; Crisis; Mental health; Poverty; Psychology; Public health; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","Noorbhai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200721","Coronavirus; Economy; Health; Lockdown; Model; Norms","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"[Meta-analysis of single-group rate of the distribution of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes in 2 139 patients with coronavirus disease 2019]","To systematically evaluate the incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) syndrome in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and to provide a basis for the standard of COVID-19 syndrome differentiation. CNKI, China Medical Journal Network, PubMed and Embase databases were searched by computer, and TCM syndrome data of COVID-19 cross-sectional surveys and case series were collected from the establishment of the database to March 31st in 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted relevant data such as TCM syndromes, and evaluated the quality of the literature according to the quality assessment tool recommended by the JBI Evidence-Based Health Care Center. Stata 14.0 software was used to perform a single-group Meta-analysis of TCM syndromes. Thirteen cross-sectional studies and 5 case series studies were included, with a total of 2 139 patients. The analysis of the cross-sectional studies showed that the risk bias was higher in the identification, control and accuracy of the confounding factors, and the description of the reliability and validity of the outcome indicators was unclear. The analysis of the case series studies showed that the overall risk bias was small, but there was a lack of a comprehensive description of the assessment when selecting patients. A total of 33 TCM syndromes of COVID-19 were sorted out by combining the TCM syndromes with the same disease position and pathogenic syndrome in the included 18 literatures, and there were 10 types of TCM syndromes of which the number of occurrences was â‰¥ 50, the incidence rate was â‰¥ 10%, and had statistical significance [indicated that 95% confidence interval (95%CI) didn't cross the meaningless line 0], including cold dampness syndrome (469 cases, incidence rate was 28.2%, 95%CI was 5.9%-50.6%), damp heat syndrome (247 cases, incidence rate was 32.1%, 95%CI was 10.7%-53.6%), epidemic closed lung syndrome (228 cases, incidence rate was 28.9%, 95%CI was 12.5%-45.2%), pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (202 cases, incidence rate was 22.1%, 95%CI was 9.5%-34.7%), dampness stagnation lung syndrome (180 cases, incidence rate was 41.2%, 95%CI was 18.4%-64.1%), dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome (81 cases, incidence rate was 56.3%, 95%CI was 48.1%-64.4%), evil heat syndrome lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%), dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome (70 cases, incidence rate was 13.4%, 95%CI was 10.4%-16.3%), heat poisoning lung closure syndrome (55 cases, incidence rate was 16.9%, 95%CI was 8.3%-25.5%), and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that there were 6 types of TCM syndromes that met the above conditions in cross-sectional studies, namely cold and damp lung syndrome (200 cases, incidence rate was 20.9%, 95%CI was 12.6%-29.2%), damp heat syndrome (221 cases, incidence rate was 41.8%, 95%CI was 9.4%-74.2%), dampness-disease lung syndrome (120 cases, incidence rate was 41.4%, 95%CI was 8.6%-74.3%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (115 cases, incidence rate was 19.2%, 95%CI was 6.8%-31.7%), heat-fever lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%) and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). There were 3 kinds of TCM syndromes in case series studies, which were virus closed lung syndrome (133 cases, incidence rate was 44.0%, 95%CI was 24.5%-63.4%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (87 cases, incidence rate was 38.7%, 95%CI was 32.3%-45.0%), and dampness and depression lung syndrome (60 cases, incidence rate was 40.6%, 95%CI was 29.3%-52.0%). The TCM syndromes of COVID-19 syndrome were widely distributed and complex. The main TCM syndromes were cold dampness syndrome, damp heat syndrome, epidemic closed lung syndrome, pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome, dampness stagnation lung syndrome, dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome, evil heat syndrome lung syndrome, dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome, heat poisoning lung closure syndrome, Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome, which can provide reference for the standard of TCM syndrome differentiation of COVID-19.","Li, Liu, He, Xie, Li","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-202000509-00372","20200722","Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A call to action for psychological science","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents the greatest international biopsychosocial emergency the world has faced for a century, and psychological science has an integral role to offer in helping societies recover. The aim of this paper is to set out the shorter- and longer-term priorities for research in psychological science that will (a) frame the breadth and scope of potential contributions from across the discipline; (b) enable researchers to focus their resources on gaps in knowledge; and (c) help funders and policymakers make informed decisions about future research priorities in order to best meet the needs of societies as they emerge from the acute phase of the pandemic. The research priorities were informed by an expert panel convened by the British Psychological Society that reflects the breadth of the discipline; a wider advisory panel with international input; and a survey of 539 psychological scientists conducted early in May 2020. The most pressing need is to research the negative biopsychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate immediate and longer-term recovery, not only in relation to mental health, but also in relation to behaviour change and adherence, work, education, children and families, physical health and the brain, and social cohesion and connectedness.

"The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter","We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. During the period of May 1-4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.","Croll, Kurzweil, Hasanaj, Serrano, Balcer, Galetta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034","20200803","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Residency; Resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Brown, Karp, Lenard, Cameron, Dawdani, Lavretsky, Miller, Mulsant, Pham, Reynolds, Roose, Lenze","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013","20200826","Covid-19 Pandemic; anxiety; depression; resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The unpredictability and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic; the associated lockdowns, physical distancing, and other containment strategies; and the resulting economic breakdown could increase the risk of mental health problems and exacerbate health inequalities. Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services.","Moreno, Wykes, Galderisi, Nordentoft, Crossley, Jones, Cannon, Correll, Byrne, Carr, Chen, Gorwood, Johnson, KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen, Krystal, Lee, Lieberman, LÃ³pez-Jaramillo, MÃ¤nnikkÃ¶, Phillips, Uchida, Vieta, Vita, Arango","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30307-2","20200831","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. An online survey was performed through QualtricsÂ® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). In total, NÂ =Â 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off â‰¥10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off â‰¥10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off â‰¥15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35Â years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values &lt;.05).

"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9Â â‰¥Â 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7Â â‰¥Â 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISIÂ â‰¥Â 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1Î² and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (Î²Â =Â 0.313, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (Î²Â =Â 0.411, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (Î²Â =Â 0.358, PÂ =Â 0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (Î²Â =Â 0.163, PÂ =Â 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (Î²Â =Â 0.101, PÂ =Â 0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.","Hu, Chen, Zheng, You, Tan, Hu, Zhang, Ding","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20200823","COVID-19; Hospitalization; Inflammatory markers; Mental health; Patients","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

With the premise that psychiatric care is essential healthcare, a panel of physician and non-physician leaders representing Region 5, met and developed recommendations, and feedback iteratively, using an adaptive modified Delphi methodology. This facilitated the development of a service and patient prioritization document to triage and to deliver behavioral health services in 21 counties which comprised Region 5 PIHP. Our procedures were organized around the principles of mitigation and contingency management, like physical health service delivery paradigms.

"Identifying Moral Injury in Healthcare Professionals: The Moral Injury Symptom Scale-HP","ThisÂ study aims to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a measure of moral injury (MI) symptoms for identifying clinically significant MI in health professionals (HPs), one that might be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. A cutoff score was identified from a receiver operator curve (ROC) that best identified individuals with significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The 10-item MISS-HP measuresÂ 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10-100). Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. PCA identified three factors, which was confirmed by CFA, explaining 56.8% of the variance. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by modest correlations (r'sâ€‰=â€‰0.25-0.37) with low religiosity, depression, and anxiety symptoms, whereas convergent validity was evident by strong correlations with clinician burnout (râ€‰=â€‰0.57) and with another multi-item measure of MI symptoms (râ€‰=â€‰0.65). ROC characteristics indicated that a score of 36 or higher was 84% sensitive and 93% specific for identifying MI symptoms causing moderate to extreme problems with family, social, and occupational functioning. The MISS-HP is a reliable and valid measure of moral injury symptoms in health professionals that can be used in clinical practice to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment, as well as when conducting researchÂ that evaluates interventions to treat MI in HPs.","Mantri, Lawson, Wang, Koenig","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01065-w","20200721","Burnout; Depression; Health professionals; Internal conflict; Moral injury; Religiosity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A projection for psychiatry in the post-COVID-19 era: potential trends, challenges, and directions","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the face of psychiatry over a very short time period. Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis.","TÃ¼rkÃ¶zer, Ã–ngÃ¼r","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0841-2","20200721",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental Health and Cancer: Why It Is Time to Innovate and Integrate-A Call to Action","Surgical, radio-oncological, and medical anti-cancer therapies have developed at pace and scale in recent years, yet there remains a huge unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Recent experience in the COVID-19 pandemic has added to recognition of this unmet need. There needs to be more effective clinical integration of relevant services, which must be informed by patient choice and clinical need, and accessible throughout the patient's whole cancer journey. This needs to be accompanied by training and research integration as well as more effective and creative use of technology such as virtual reality and simulation, quality assuring apps, and mobile technologies. Finally, as a clinical community we need to drive a shift in culture towards measurement of patient quality of life as a marker of treatment effectiveness. We also need to support our own clinical workforce with their own mental health needs so that we prevent the alarming rates of burnout prevalent among clinicians treating cancer. The call to action for innovation and staff support has been amplified by experience in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: This report highlights the unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Patients need effective access to psychological support and mental health services throughout their cancer journey, including better use of technology. There is also a need to support the psychological wellbeing of cancer clinicians.","Fernando","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.06.025","20200720","Burnout; COVID-19; Cancer; Innovation; Integration; Mental health; Psychiatry; Quality of life; Simulation; Technology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a cross-sectional study","To date, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53-36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27-32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants' self-reported safety scores for HCW's protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ying, Ruan, Kong, Zhu, Ji, Lou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02784-w","20200730","Anxiety symptoms; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Depressive symptoms; Family members of health care workers; Mental health; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Family; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Health Questionnaire; Personal Protective Equipment; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Time Factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Early Food Insecurity Impacts of COVID-19","COVID-19 has disrupted food access and impacted food insecurity, which is associated with numerous adverse individual and public health outcomes. To assess these challenges and understand their impact on food security, we conducted a statewide population-level survey using a convenience sample in Vermont from March 29 to April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the United States Department of Agriculture six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post-COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Among 3219 respondents, there was nearly a one-third increase (32.3%) in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with 35.5% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were at higher odds of experiencing food insecurity (OR 3.06; 95% CI, 2.114-0.46). We report multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19. Respondents experiencing household food insecurity had higher odds of facing access challenges and utilizing coping strategies, including two-thirds of households eating less since COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. These findings have important potential impacts on individual health, including mental health and malnutrition, as well as on future healthcare costs. We suggest proactive strategies to address food insecurity during this crisis.","Niles, Bertmann, Belarmino, Wentworth, Biehl, Neff","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072096","20200727","COVID-19; coronavirus; employment; food access; food security; malnutrition; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Family Characteristics; Female; Food Supply; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Quarantine; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Vermont","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Perceived Threat of COVID-19 Contagion and Frontline Paramedics' Agonistic Behaviour: Employing a Stressor-Strain-Outcome Perspective","Historically, infectious diseases have been the leading cause of human psychosomatic strain and death tolls. This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor-strain-outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour. This study also theorized the concept of human agonistic behaviour, which has key implications for future researchers.","Shahzad, Du, Khan, Fateh, Shahbaz, Abbas, Wattoo","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145102","20200731","COVID-19; agonistic behaviour; anxiety; depression; social support; Adult; Agonistic Behavior; Allied Health Personnel; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Changes in alcohol use as a function of psychological distress and social support following COVID-19 related University closings","Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30Â days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.","Lechner, Laurene, Patel, Anderson, Grega, Kenne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527","20200818","Alcohol use; Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Social support; Adult; Alcohol Drinking in College; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Ohio; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent","The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32-70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0-34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (PÂ = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (&gt;60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.","Deora, Mishra, Tripathi, Garg, Tandon, Borkar, Varshney, Raut, Chaurasia, Chandra, Kale","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038","20200810","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Neurosurgery; Social media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

A cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited from the community through snowball sampling with anonymous online questionnaires, using 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 28-item Brief Coping Inventory (COPE) to measure their psychiatric disorders, PTSD level, and coping strategies. Of the total 1109 participants, 42.65% and 67.09% self-reported psychiatric disorders and high PTSD level, respectively. Age, occupation, and education level were significantly association with psychological status. The status of psychiatric disorders was also significantly related to high PTSD level. Using both emotion and problem coping was better for psychiatric status (aOR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.98) and problem-focused coping was significantly associated with high PTSD level (aOR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.25-3.51). Negative psychological outcomes were common among the general people during the COVID-19 outbreak, and the findings may provide references for intervention guidelines of mental health for the community population.","Li","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa226","20200901","COVID-19; community; coping response; psychosocial response","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Digital or Digitally Delivered Responses to Domestic and Intimate Partner Violence During COVID-19","Before the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), 1 in 3 women and girls, globally, were victimized by an abusive partner in intimate relationships. However, the current pandemic has amplified cases of domestic violence (DV) against women and girls, with up to thrice the prevalence in DV cases compared to the same time last year. Evidence of the adverse effects of the pandemic on DV is still emerging, even as violence prevention strategies are iteratively being refined by service providers, advocacy agencies, and survivors to meet stay-at-home mandates. Emotional and material support for survivors is a critical resource increasingly delivered using digital and technology-based modalities, which offer several advantages and challenges. This paper rapidly describes current DV mitigation approaches using digital solutions, signaling emerging best practices to support survivors, their children, and abusers during stay-at-home advisories. Some examples of technology-based strategies and solutions are presented. An immediate priority is mapping out current digital solutions in response to COVID-19-related DV and outlining issues with uptake, coverage, and meaningful use of digital solutions.","Emezue","https://doi.org/10.2196/19831","20200804","COVID-19; abuse; coronavirus; digital interventions; domestic violence; intimate partner violence; mental health; pandemic; prevention; technology; Coronavirus Infections; Domestic Violence; Female; Global Health; Humans; Intimate Partner Violence; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Social Support; Survivors; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A Mixed-method Study of Individual, Couple, and Parental Functioning During the State-regulated COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain","During the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, we explored the individual and relational well-being of people confined together with their partners and/or children during the first 3Â weeks of state-regulated lockdown. Adults 18Â years or older (NÂ =Â 407) completed an online survey that included demographic, household, and employment information along with standardized measures of psychological distress (State-Trait Anxiety and Beck Depression) and relationship functioning-either the Dyadic Adjustment Scale if there were no children in the household or a Basic Family Relations Evaluation Questionnaire (CERFB) measuring conjugal, parental, and coparental functions. Qualitative analyses of responses to an open-ended question about perceived changes in couple or family dynamics during lockdown revealed nine specific themes comprising two overarching categories: relational improvement and deterioration. The overall prevalence of improvement themes (61.7%) exceeded deterioration themes (41.0%), with increased (re)connection and conflict atmosphere cited most often. Quantitative analyses found elevated levels of state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression during lockdown. Consistent with the qualitative results, couples having no children at home reported high levels of dyadic adjustment, but with children present CERFB parental functioning exceeded conjugal functioning, a pattern sometimes associated with child triangulation into adult conflicts. Although correlates of psychological distress (e.g., unemployment, perceived economic risk) were relatively stable across subgroups, predictors of relationship functioning varied substantially with household/parental status (e.g., telecommuting and employment facilitated conjugal functioning only for couples with children). Durante el reciente brote de la COVID-19 en EspaÃ±a, analizamos el bienestar individual y relacional de las personas confinadas con sus parejas o hijos durante las primeras tres semanas de confinamiento regulado por el estado. Un grupo de adultos mayores de 18 aÃ±os (N=407) completÃ³ una encuesta con datos demogrÃ¡ficos, informaciÃ³n sobre la vivienda y el empleo, evaluaciones estandarizadas de distrÃ©s psicolÃ³gico (ansiedad-rasgo y ansiedad-estado, depresiÃ³n de Beck) y funcionamiento familiar (la Escala de ajuste diÃ¡dico si no habÃ­a niÃ±os en la vivienda o un Cuestionario bÃ¡sico de evaluaciÃ³n de las relaciones familiares (CERFB) que miden las funciones conyugales, parentales y coparentales. Los anÃ¡lisis cualitativos de las respuestas a una pregunta abierta acerca de los cambios percibidos en la dinÃ¡mica de pareja o familiar durante el confinamiento revelaron nueve temas especÃ­ficos que comprenden dos categorÃ­as dominantes: la mejora y el deterioro relacional. La prevalencia general de los temas de mejora (61.7Â %) excediÃ³ los temas de deterioro (41.0Â %), y se mencionÃ³ con mÃ¡s frecuencia una mayor (re)conexiÃ³n y un ambiente de conflicto. Los anÃ¡lisis cuantitativos indicaron niveles elevados de ansiedad-estado pero no de ansiedad-rasgo ni de depresiÃ³n durante el confinamiento. De acuerdo con los resultados cualitativos, las parejas que no tienen hijos en la casa informaron niveles altos de ajuste diÃ¡dico, pero con los niÃ±os presentes, el funcionamiento parental del CERFB excediÃ³ el funcionamiento conyugal, un patrÃ³n asociado a veces con la triangulaciÃ³n de los niÃ±os en los conflictos de los adultos. Aunque las relaciones de distrÃ©s psicolÃ³gico (p. ej.: desempleo, riesgo econÃ³mico percibido) fueron relativamente estables entre los subgrupos, los predictores del funcionamiento relacional variaron considerablemente con la situaciÃ³n habitacional/parental (p. ej: el teletrabajo y el empleo facilitaron el funcionamiento conyugal solo en el caso de las parejas con niÃ±os). æœ€è¿‘åœ¨COVID-19æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žçˆ†å‘æœŸé—´çš„è¥¿ç­ç‰™ï¼Œæˆ‘ä»¬æŽ¢ç´¢äº†åœ¨å›½å®¶ç®¡æŽ§å°åŸŽç¦è¶³çš„å¤´ä¸‰ä¸ªæ˜ŸæœŸé‡Œï¼Œåœ¨äººä»¬ä¸Žå…¶ä¼´ä¾£å’Œ/æˆ–å„¿ç«¥ä¸€èµ·è¢«å…³é—­èµ·æ¥çš„æƒ…å†µä¸‹ï¼Œä¸ªä½“çš„å¥åº·çŠ¶å†µå’Œå…³ç³»çš„å¥åº·æƒ…å†µã€‚407ä½18å²æˆ–ä»¥ä¸Šçš„æˆå¹´äºº(N=407) å®Œæˆäº†ä¸€é¡¹åœ¨çº¿è°ƒæŸ¥ï¼Œå†…å®¹åŒ…æ‹¬äººå£ã€å®¶åº­å’Œå°±ä¸šä¿¡æ¯ï¼Œè¿˜æœ‰æ ‡å‡†åŒ–çš„å¿ƒç†å›°æ‰°é‡è¡¨(çŠ¶æ€-ç‰¹è´¨ç„¦è™‘ã€è´å…‹æŠ‘éƒ)ä»¥åŠå…³ç³»åŠŸèƒ½----å¦‚æžœå®¶åº­ä¸­æ²¡æœ‰å„¿ç«¥ï¼Œåˆ™é‡‡ç”¨äºŒåˆ†è°ƒæ•´é‡è¡¨ï¼Œæˆ–è€…åŸºæœ¬å®¶åº­å…³ç³»è¯„ä¼°é—®å·(CERFB)æµ‹é‡å¤«å¦»ã€çˆ¶æ¯å’Œå…±åŒçˆ¶æ¯çš„åŠŸèƒ½ã€‚æœ¬ç ”ç©¶å¯¹ä¸€ä¸ªå¼€æ”¾å¼é—®é¢˜çš„å›žç­”ä½œäº†å®šæ€§åˆ†æžï¼Œç»“æžœæ­ç¤ºäº†9ä¸ªç‰¹å®šçš„ä¸»é¢˜ï¼Œä¸¤ä¸ªå¤§çš„ç±»åˆ«å³å…³ç³»å¾—åˆ°æ”¹å–„å’Œå…³ç³»èµ°å‘æ¶åŒ–ä¸¤ç§ã€‚ä½¿ç”¨çš„é—®é¢˜æ˜¯å…³äºŽä¼´ä¾£å…³ç³»æ–¹é¢æˆ–å®¶åº­äº’åŠ¨æ–¹é¢å‘ç”Ÿçš„å¯è§‰å¯Ÿå˜åŒ–ã€‚å…³ç³»æœ‰æ”¹å–„çš„ä¸»é¢˜å äº†ä¸»å¯¼ï¼Œè¾¾æµ‹é‡å¯¹è±¡çš„61.7%ï¼Œè¶…è¿‡äº†å…³ç³»æœ‰æ‰€æ¶åŒ–çš„ä¸»é¢˜(å 41.0%)ï¼Œå…¶ä¸­æœ€å¸¸æåˆ°çš„æ˜¯ç›¸äº’ä¹‹é—´çš„ï¼ˆé‡æ–°ï¼‰è¿žæŽ¥å¢žå¼ºäº† ï¼Œè¿˜æœ‰æ›´å¤šçš„å†²çªæƒ…å†µã€‚å®šé‡åˆ†æžç ”ç©¶å‘çŽ°ï¼Œåœ¨ç®¡åˆ¶ç¦é—­æœŸé—´ï¼Œæƒ…ç»ªçŠ¶æ€åž‹çš„ç„¦è™‘æ°´å¹³å‡é«˜ï¼Œä½†ç”Ÿç†ç‰¹è´¨æ€§ç„¦è™‘æˆ–ç”Ÿç†æ€§æŠ‘éƒçš„æ°´å¹³æ²¡æœ‰å‡é«˜ã€‚ä¸Žå®šæ€§ç ”ç©¶ç»“æžœç›¸ä¸€è‡´çš„æ˜¯ï¼Œæ²¡æœ‰å­©å­çš„å®¶åº­æŠ¥å‘Šäº†é«˜æ°´å¹³çš„äºŒå…ƒé€‚åº”ï¼Œä½†æœ‰å­©å­çš„æƒ…å†µä¸‹ï¼Œé—®å·ä¸­å½’çº³å‡ºçš„ä¸ºäººçˆ¶æ¯çš„åŠŸèƒ½è¶…è¿‡äº†é…å¶çš„åŠŸèƒ½ï¼Œè¿™ç§æ¨¡å¼æœ‰æ—¶å’Œå„¿ç«¥æž„æˆçš„ä¸‰è§’å…³ç³»æ¼”å˜æˆæˆäººå†²çªã€‚è™½ç„¶å¿ƒç†åŽ‹åŠ›çš„ç›¸å…³å› ç´ (å¦‚å¤±ä¸šã€æ„ŸçŸ¥åˆ°çš„ç»æµŽé£Žé™©)åœ¨å„ä¸ªäºšç¾¤ä½“ä¸­ç›¸å¯¹ç¨³å®šï¼Œä½†å…³ç³»åŠŸèƒ½çš„é¢„æµ‹å› ç´ å› å®¶åº­/çˆ¶æ¯çŽ°çŠ¶è€Œæ˜¾è‘—ä¸åŒ(ä¾‹å¦‚ï¼Œè¿œç¨‹åŠžå…¬å’Œå°±ä¸šä¿ƒè¿›çš„å©šå§»åŠŸèƒ½ä»…é€‚ç”¨äºŽæœ‰å­©å­çš„å¤«å¦‡)ã€‚.","GÃ¼nther-Bel, Vilaregut, Carratala, Torras-Garat, PÃ©rez-Testor","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12585","20200829","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Couple; Family; Lockdown; Quarantine; confinamiento; coronavirus; cuarentena; familia; pareja; ä¼´ä¾£; å®¶åº­; æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Ž; é—­å…³å°é”; éš”ç¦»","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental health of orthopaedic trauma patients during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been associated with reports of increased anxiety, depression and fear among the general population. People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, pÂ &lt;â€‰0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, pÂ =â€‰0.005). Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019. Stress induced by the coronavirus pandemic can place patients with mental illness at a higher risk for perilous behaviours and subsequent fractures.","Ohliger, Umpierrez, Buehler, Ohliger, Magister, Vallier, Hirschfeld","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04711-w","20200720","COVID-19; Interpersonal violence; Mental health; Orthopaedic trauma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychosocial and Socio-Economic Crisis in Bangladesh Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Perception-Based Assessment","<b>Background:</b> The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the partial lockdown, the disease intensity, weak governance in the healthcare system, insufficient medical facilities, unawareness, and the sharing of misinformation in the mass media has led to people experiencing fear and anxiety. The present study intended to conduct a perception-based analysis to get an idea of people's psychosocial and socio-economic crisis, and the possible environmental crisis, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A perception-based questionnaire was put online for Bangladeshi citizens of 18 years and/or older. The sample size was 1,066 respondents. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques including principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis. <b>Results:</b> There was a positive significant association between fear of the COVID-19 outbreak with the struggling healthcare system (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) of the country. Also, there was a negative association between the fragile health system of Bangladesh and the government's ability to deal with the pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), revealing the poor governance in the healthcare system. A positive association of shutdown and social distancing with the fear of losing one's own or a family members' life, influenced by a lack of healthcare treatment (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), reveals that, due to the decision of shutting down normal activities, people may be experiencing mental and economic stress. However, a positive association of the socio-economic impact of the shutdown with poor people's suffering, the price hike of basic essentials, the hindering of formal education (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and the possibility of a severe socio-economic and health crisis will be aggravated. Moreover, there is a possibility of a climate change-induced disaster and infectious diseases like dengue during/after the COVID-19 situation, which will create severe food insecurity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and a further healthcare crisis. <b>Conclusions:</b> The partial lockdown in Bangladesh due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased community transmission and worsened the healthcare crisis, economic burden, and loss of GDP despite the resuming of industrial operations. In society, it has created psychosocial and socio-economic insecurity among people due to the loss of lives and livelihoods. The government should take proper inclusive steps for risk assessment, communications, and financial stimulus toward the public to alleviate their fear and anxiety, and to take proper action to boost mental health and well-being.","Bodrud-Doza, Shammi, Bahlman, Islam, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00341","20200718","COVID-19; fear; linear regression model; perception-based questionnaire; principal component analysis (PCA); social conflict","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Exploring the challenges faced by frontline workers in health and social care amid the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of frontline workers in the English Midlands region, UK","The first cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Globally millions of people have been diagnosed with the virus whilst thousands have died. As the virus kept spreading health and social care frontline workers (HSCFW) were faced with difficulties when discharging their duties. This paper was set out to explore the challenges faced by different frontline workers in health and social care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research utilized an explorative qualitative approach. A total of forty (NÂ =Â 40) in-depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HSCFW who included support workers (nÂ =Â 15), nurses (nÂ =Â 15), and managers (NÂ =Â 10). Health and social care workers were drawn from domiciliary care and care homes (with and without nursing services). All the interviews were done online. The data were thematically analyzed, and the emergent themes were supported by quotes from the interviews held with participants. Following data analysis the research study found that lack of pandemic preparedness, <b>s</b>hortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), anxiety and fear amongst professionals, challenges in enforcing social distancing, challenges in fulfilling social shielding responsibility, anxiety and fear amongst residents and service users, delay in testing, evolving PPE guidance and shortage of staff were challenges faced by frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the current study point to a need for adequate pandemic preparedness within the health and social care sector to protect both frontline workers and the individuals they look after.","Nyashanu, Pfende, Ekpenyong","https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1792425","20200717","COVID-19; UK; front-line workers; mental health; pandemic; shortage","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study of Perinatal Risk and Resilience During COVID-19","<b>Introduction/Objectives:</b> National guidelines underscore the need for improvement in the detection and treatment of mood disorders in the perinatal period. Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. <b>Methods:</b> The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. <b>Results:</b> Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Since the onset of COVID-19, many pregnant and postpartum women report struggling with stress, depression, and anxiety symptomatology. Findings from this pilot study begin to inform future intervention work to best support this highly vulnerable population.","Farewell, Jewell, Walls, Leiferman","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720944074","20200721","disasters; mood disorders; perinatal mental health; postpartum care; prenatal care; Adult; Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Qualitative Research; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Assessment; Stress, Psychological; United States; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How to prevent in-hospital COVID-19 infection and reassure women about the safety of pregnancy: Experience from an obstetric center in China","This study aimed to describe the emergency responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for pregnant patients at our hospital and their effect on hospital operations and patients' outcomes. We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed and the patients' characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological interventions showed optimistic effects in ameliorating depression and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our strategies were effective in preventing in-hospital infection of COVID-19 and reassuring women about the safety of pregnancy. Monitoring and managing psychological issues were necessary during this critical period.","Gu, Chen, Yu, Liang, Chen, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520939337","20200727","Coronavirus disease 2019; depression; hospital-acquired infection; pregnancy outcome; psychological stability; telemedicine; Adult; Anxiety; Body Temperature; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Depression; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infection Control; Obstetrics; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Outpatients; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Telemedicine; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Quality of sleep and health-related quality of life among health care professionals treating patients with coronavirus disease-19","Health care professionals exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are facing high levels of stress. The aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep (QoS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among health care professionals treating patients with COVID-19, as well as quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression and levels of anxiety. We included 201 health care professionals in a cross-sectional, web-based study by applying 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, 36-item Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and additional survey constructed for the purpose of the study. Health care workers who treated COVID-19 patients were more afraid of becoming infected or of transmitting the infection to a family member with a significantly low self-assessment of their mental status. Poor QoS and HRQoL correlated with high health anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and several demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher scores on GAD-7 (betaâ€‰=â€‰.71, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01) and lower scores on mental health (MH) subscale on SF36 questionnaire (betaâ€‰=â€‰-.69; <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01) were independent predictors of the higher PSQI score (adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>â€‰=â€‰.61, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01 for overall model).

The major MH burden of health care professionals treating infected patients during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that they need psychological support.","Stojanov, Malobabic, Stanojevic, Stevic, Milosevic, Stojanov","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020942800","20200722","COVID-19; pandemic; quality of life; quality of sleep","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health and Work Attitudes among People Resuming Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in China","The unprecedented outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused an economic downturn and increased the unemployment rate in China. In this context, employees face health and social economic stressors. To assess their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization) and work attitudes (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction and turnover intention) as well as the associated factors, we conducted a cross-sectional study among people who resumed work after the Spring Festival holiday during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization among these people was 12.7%, 13.5%, 20.7% and 6.6%, respectively. The major risk factor for mental health was worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were psychological strengths (i.e., resilience and optimism). Regarding work attitudes, the percentage of people who felt more satisfied with their job (43.8%) was larger than that of those who felt less satisfied (26.9%), while the percentage of people who thought about quitting their job more frequently (15.7%) was smaller than that of those who considered it less frequently (63.2%). However, work engagement was lower than usual. Similar to the factors associated with mental health, the major risk factor for work attitudes was also worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were resilience and optimism. In addition, the nature of the organization, job status, age, position and income changes were also related to these work attitudes. Our findings shed light on the need for organization administrators to be aware of the status of and factors associated with employees' mental health and work attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies or interventions could be developed based on our findings.","Song, Wang, Li, Yang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145059","20200731","COVID-19; employees; job satisfaction; mental health; resume work; turnover intention; work attitudes; work engagement; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Personnel Turnover; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Work Engagement","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Social Distancing among Medical Students during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in China: Disease Awareness, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and Behavioral Activities","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, harsh social distancing measures were taken in China to contain viral spread. We examined their impact on the lives of medical students. A nation-wide cross-sectional survey of college students was conducted from 4-12 February 2020. We enrolled medical students studying public health in Beijing and Wuhan to assess their COVID-19 awareness and to evaluate their mental health status/behaviors using a self-administered questionnaire. We used the Patient Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Health Questionnaire-9 to measure anxiety disorders and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression and path analysis to assess the associations between covariates and anxiety disorder/depression. Of 933 students, 898 (96.2%) reported wearing masks frequently when going out, 723 (77.5%) reported daily handwashing with soap, 676 (72.5%) washed hands immediately after arriving home, and 914 (98.0%) reported staying home as much as possible. Prevalence of anxiety disorder was 17.1% and depression was 25.3%. Multivariable logistic regression showed anxiety to be associated with graduate student status (odds ratio (aOR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.5), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-1.7), and feeling depressed (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI: 4.0-11.7). Beijing students were significantly less likely to have anxiety than those in the Wuhan epicenter (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8-1.0), but depression did not differ. Depression was associated with female students (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.3), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.9), and anxiety disorder (aOR = 5.8; 95% CI: 3.4-9.9). Path analysis validated these same predictors. Despite medical students' knowledge of disease control and prevention, their lives were greatly affected by social distancing, especially in the Wuhan epicenter. Even well-informed students needed psychological support during these extraordinarily stressful times.","Xiao, Shu, Li, Li, Tao, Wu, Yu, Meng, Vermund, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145047","20200731","COVID-19; China; anxiety disorder; depression; knowledge; medical students; personal protective measures; social distancing; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Awareness; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Behavior; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mapping population mental health concerns related to COVID-19 and the consequences of physical distancing: a Google trends analysis","<b>Background:</b> The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Â Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown.Â <b>Methods:</b> We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - Â 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. <b>Conclusions:</b> Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Evans, Marchant, Gunnell, John","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2","20200717","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Economic; Mental health; Pandemic; Suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The ups and downs of daily life during COVID-19: Age differences in affect, stress, and positive events","Past research has linked older age with greater emotional well-being and decreased reactivity to stressors, but it is unknown whether age-related advantages in emotional well-being are maintained in the wake of COVID-19. We examined age differences in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors and positive events in the first several weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.","Klaiber, Wen, DeLongis, Sin","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa096","20200901","aging; coronavirus; daily stress; emotions; pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Do pre-existing anxiety-related and mood disorders differentially impact COVID-19 stress responses and coping?","People with pre-existing mental health conditions may be more susceptible to stressors associated with COVID-19 relative to the general population; however, no studies have assessed whether susceptibility differs between classes of mental health disorders. We assessed COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stressors, and coping in those with a primary anxiety-related disorder diagnosis, a primary mood disorder diagnosis, and no mental health disorder. Adults from a population-representative sample from the United States and Canada who reported current (past year) anxiety-related (n = 700) or mood (n = 368) disorders were compared to a random sample of respondents who did not report a current mental health diagnosis (n = 500) on COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stress, and coping. The anxiety-related disorders group exhibited higher COVID Stress Scales total scores and higher scores on its fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms scales than the other groups. The mood disorders group had higher scores on the traumatic stress symptoms and socioeconomic consequences scales than those with no current mental disorder. Those with current anxiety-related or mood disorders were more likely to voluntarily self-isolate and were more likely to report greater self-isolation stressors and distress than those without a mental health disorder. Yet, there were no major differences in perceived effectiveness of coping strategies across groups. People with anxiety-related or mood disorders were more negatively affected by COVID-19 compared to those with no mental health disorder; however, adding to psychological burden, those with anxiety-related disorders reported greater fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms than the other groups. These findings suggest the need for tailoring COVID-19-related mental health interventions to meet the specific needs of people with pre-existing mental health conditions.","Asmundson, Paluszek, Landry, Rachor, McKay, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102271","20200826","Anxiety-related disorders; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Mood disorders; Pandemic; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety Disorders; Canada; Case-Control Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Mood Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; United States; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Negative cognitive and psychological correlates of mandatory quarantine during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China","Quarantine plays a key role in controlling the pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

"COVID-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society","The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak).

"Exercise and screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this paper is to describe the exercise and changes in screen time habits, and their relationship with health, among participants of the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS). Between March 29th and April 3rd 2020, CPSS participants (n = 4,524) reported whether they were exercising outdoors or indoors and whether they increased, decreased or maintained their TV, Internet and video game use. Participants also reported their self-perceived general and mental health. More women reported very good or excellent mental health if they were exercising outdoors (54%) compared with those who were not (41%). More women reported very good or excellent general health if they were exercising outdoors (75%) compared with those who were not (49%), with the same trend evident for those exercising indoors (69%) compared to those who were not (62%). More men (65%) and women (62%) rated their mental and general health as very good or excellent if they maintained or decreased TV time compared with those who increased TV time (57% and 43%, respectively), with the same evident for Internet use in women only (maintained/decreased: 61% versus increased: 44%). More men (63%) and women (52%) rated their mental health as very good or excellent if they maintained or decreased video game time compared with those who increased video game time (48% and 29%, respectively). More men and women reported very good or excellent mental and general health if they increased none or one type of screen and/or were exercising outdoors compared with those who increased 2 or 3 types of screens and who were not exercising outdoors, with the exception of general health among men. Maintaining opportunities for outdoor exercise and limiting screen time may promote better mental and general health during periods of confinement.","Colley, Bushnik, Langlois","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000600001-eng","20200723","coronavirus; mental health; physical activity; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Screen Time","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Factors contributing to the distress, concerns, and needs of UK Neuroscience health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 research from China suggests health care workers are at risk of distress, have specific concerns, and need support. It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high incidence of psychological distress in UK health care staff. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued are influenced by individual staff characteristics. Stratified, one-to-one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches for stress reduction and resilience, are crucial.","Cipolotti, Chan, Murphy, van Harskamp, Foley","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12298","20200807","COVID-19; Pandemic; clinical neuropsychology; distress; health care workforce; psychological well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"How Have COVID-19 Isolation Policies Affected Young People's Mental Health? - Evidence From Chinese College Students","The breakout of COVID-19 has brought about huge influence on people's physic and mental health. This paper aims to investigate the mental health status of young people living in isolation due to the policy response to Coronavirus disease. Nine hundred ninety-two Chinese college students (<i>M</i>age = 19.45, <i>SD</i> = 1.41) were recruited to finish an online survey in the period of self-isolation. Seven dimensions of psychological well-being were measured, including mental status, knowledge of stress management, behavioral patterns, risk perception, academic stress, family relationships, and peer relationships. Results of cluster analysis indicated that young individuals' mental status can be divided into three groups: high-risk (<i>n</i> = 61, <i>M</i>age = 19.26, <i>SD</i> = 1.32), medium-risk (<i>n</i> = 627, <i>M</i>age = 19.43, <i>SD</i> = 1.38), and low-risk (<i>n</i> = 304, <i>M</i>age = 19.54, <i>SD</i> = 1.49). Moreover, results of multiple regression showed that the isolation policy has had a complex influence on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 44.894, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], fear [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 30.776, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], hypochondria [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 22.530, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], depression [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 39.022, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], and neurasthenia [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 45.735, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001] via various factors.

"Psychological Support System for Hospital Workers During the Covid-19 Outbreak: Rapid Design and Implementation of the Covid-Psy Hotline","The worldwide coronavirus outbreak has put hospital workers under extreme stress with possible mental health problems. In this context, we decided to rapidly design and implement a psychological support system for all hospital workers in Paris during the Covid-19 outbreak. We built a hotline in 3 days using the following steps: 1) official mandate, 2) request for the creation of hotline numbers, 3) formulation of psychological intervention materials and policies, 4) call for volunteer certified psychologists, 5) call for volunteer certified psychiatrists in case of psychiatric cases, 6) creation of an anonymous and protected database, and 7) communication and regular reminders about the existence of the hotline for hospital workers. After the first 26 days, we received 149 calls with a mean of 5.73 calls/day (SD=3.22). The average call duration was 18.5 min (min=1; max=65min; SD=14.7), and mostly women (86%) called. The mean age was 32.7 years old (SD=11.0). Calls from hospital workers were from all professions; though mostly represented by frontline healthcare workers, non-frontline departments also called (total of 44 departments). Reasons for calling were anxiety symptoms (n=73, 49%), request for hotline information (n=31, 20.8%), worries about Covid-19 (n=23, 15.44%), exhaustion (n=17, 11.41%), trauma reactivation (n=10, 6.11%), insomnia (n=9, 6.0%), anger (n=8, 5.37%), depressive (n=6, 4.02%), and psychotic symptoms (n=3, 2.01%). Regarding referrals, 105 (70.47%) of them were referred to psychosocial, Covid, and general support. This psychological support system can be easily duplicated and seems to benefit all hospital professions that all appeared psychologically affected.","Geoffroy, Le Goanvic, Sabbagh, Richoux, Weinstein, Dufayet, Lejoyeux","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00511","20200717","healthcare workers; medical workers; mental health; psychiatry; psychological intervention; psychology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Addressing the Problem of Severe Underinvestment in Mental Health and Well-Being from a Human Rights Perspective","Throughout the world, mental health remains a neglected priority, low on the agenda of policy makers and funders at the national and international levels. While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions-which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience-there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to &quot;scale up&quot; mental health and to reduce &quot;treatment gaps&quot; are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+the+Problem+of+Severe+Underinvestment+in+Mental+Health+and+Well-Being+from+a+Human+Rights+Perspective.","20200731","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Developing Countries; Global Health; Health Care Rationing; Human Rights; Humans; International Cooperation; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Tobacco Products","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"An Integrated Blueprint for Digital Mental Health Services Amidst COVID-19","In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing difficulties amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. The recent implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.2196/21718","20200818","COVID-19; automation; digital mental health; machine learning; mental well-being online assessments; well-being services","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Living in the midst of fear: Depressive symptomatology among US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The current study examines interrelationships between social vulnerability, individual stressors, social and psychological resources, and depressive symptomatology among US adults during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (nâ€‰=â€‰10,368 adults) is used in the analysis. On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one-third of respondents had CES-D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID-19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction. In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis. Results highlight the significance of vulnerability and individual stressors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the analysis affirms the importance of access to social and psychological resources to combat heightened fear and anxiety that persons report during the current pandemic.","Fitzpatrick, Harris, Drawve","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23080","20200807","COVID-19 pandemic; depression; fear; stressors and resources","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The process included the following: (1) anticipate mental health needs; (2) use leadership capable of mobilizing the systems and resources; (3) convene a multidisciplinary team; (4) delegate tasks and set timelines; (5) choose a clinical service model; (6) motivate staff as a workforce of volunteers; (7) develop training and educational materials; (8) develop personal, local, and national resources; (9) develop marketing plans; (10) deliver the training; (11) launch a 24 hr/7days per week Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, and launch follow-up sessions for staff; (12) structure data collection to determine effectiveness and outcomes; and (13) obtain funding (not required). We believe the process we used is specifically useful for others who may want to develop a COVID-19 hotline services for health care workers and generally useful for the development of other mental health services.

This study was conducted to identify the current difficulties, worries regarding the next 2 months, and mental distress experienced by families with children on long-term KRT during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and to deliver possible management approaches to ensure uninterrupted treatment for children on long-term KRT. A multicenter online survey was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, among the families with children on long-term KRT from five major pediatric dialysis centers in mainland China. The primary caregivers of children currently on long-term KRT were eligible and included. Demographic information, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status, current difficulties, and worries regarding the next 2 months were surveyed using a self-developed questionnaire. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 were used to screen for depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. Among the children in the 220 families included in data analysis, 113 (51%) children were on dialysis, and the other 107 (49%) had kidney transplants. No families reported confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.

"Breath Regulation and yogic Exercise An online Therapy for calm and Happiness (BREATH) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial","Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility. We will use REDCap to perform randomization in a 1:1 ratio as well as allocation concealment. REDCap is widely used by health researchers worldwide to significantly reduce data entry and study management errors to improve data fidelity. All study participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses so as to prevent any expectation bias. Group allocation will be masked during analysis. This study will randomize a total of 60 participants in a 1:1 ratio to either SKY or HEP interventions. Protocol version number 2.0 (June 5, 2020).

"Modeling Spatiotemporal Pattern of Depressive Symptoms Caused by COVID-19 Using Social Media Data Mining","By 29 May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had spread to 188 countries, infecting more than 5.9 million people, and causing 361,249 deaths. Governments issued travel restrictions, gatherings of institutions were cancelled, and citizens were ordered to socially distance themselves in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Fear of being infected by the virus and panic over job losses and missed education opportunities have increased people's stress levels. Psychological studies using traditional surveys are time-consuming and contain cognitive and sampling biases, and therefore cannot be used to build large datasets for a real-time depression analysis. In this article, we propose a CorExQ9 algorithm that integrates a Correlation Explanation (CorEx) learning algorithm and clinical Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) lexicon to detect COVID-19 related stress symptoms at a spatiotemporal scale in the United States. The proposed algorithm overcomes the common limitations of traditional topic detection models and minimizes the ambiguity that is caused by human interventions in social media data mining. The results show a strong correlation between stress symptoms and the number of increased COVID-19 cases for major U.S. cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Miami. The results also show that people's risk perception is sensitive to the release of COVID-19 related public news and media messages. Between January and March, fear of infection and unpredictability of the virus caused widespread panic and people began stockpiling supplies, but later in April, concerns shifted as financial worries in western and eastern coastal areas of the U.S. left people uncertain of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives.","Li, Chaudhary, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144988","20200720","Basilisk algorithm; COVID-19 pandemic; Correlation Explanation (CorEx); Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ); mental health; social media data mining; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uncertainty; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Treatment Delays in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and its associated restrictions could affect ischemic times in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on ischemic times in consecutive all-comer STEMI patients. We included consecutive STEMI patients (<i>n</i> = 163, median age: 61 years, 27% women) who were referred to seven tertiary care hospitals across Austria for primary percutaneous coronary intervention between 24 February 2020 (calendar week 9) and 5 April 2020 (calendar week 14). The number of patients, total ischemic times and door-to-balloon times in temporal relation to COVID-19-related restrictions and infection rates were analyzed. While rates of STEMI admissions decreased (calendar week 9/10 (<i>n</i> = 69, 42%); calendar week 11/12 (<i>n</i> = 51, 31%); calendar week 13/14 (<i>n</i> = 43, 26%)), total ischemic times increased from 164 (interquartile range (IQR): 107-281) min (calendar week 9/10) to 237 (IQR: 141-560) min (calendar week 11/12) and to 275 (IQR: 170-590) min (calendar week 13/14) (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Door-to-balloon times were constant (<i>p</i> = 0.60). There was a significant difference in post-interventional Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 in patients treated during calendar week 9/10 (97%), 11/12 (84%) and 13/14 (81%; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Rates of in-hospital death and re-infarction were similar between groups (<i>p</i> = 0.48). Results were comparable when dichotomizing data on 10 March and 16 March 2020, when official restrictions were executed. In this cohort of all-comer STEMI patients, we observed a 1.7-fold increase in ischemic time during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Austria. Patient-related factors likely explain most of this increase. Counteractive steps are needed to prevent further cardiac collateral damage during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Reinstadler, Reindl, Lechner, Holzknecht, Tiller, Roithinger, Frick, Hoppe, Jirak, Berger, Delle-Karth, LaÃŸnig, Klug, Bauer, Binder, Metzler","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072183","20200814","Coronavirus disease 2019; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; total ischemic time","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.","Elhai, Yang, McKay, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.080","20200731","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemics; Smartphone addiction; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior, Addictive; Betacoronavirus; Causality; China; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Severity of Illness Index; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation","Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.","Xiao, Zhu, Fu, Hu, Li, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.081","20200731","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health care workers; Stress; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Attitude of Health Personnel; Betacoronavirus; Causality; China; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry","The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.","Anmella, Arbelo, Fico, Murru, Llach, Madero, Gomes-da-Costa, Imaz, LÃ³pez-Pelayo, Vieta, Pintor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149","20200731","COVID-19; Consultation liaison psychiatry; Interactions; Psychiatry; Psychodrug; Psychopharmacology; Aged; Anti-Anxiety Agents; Antidepressive Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry; Referral and Consultation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Expanding Possibilities: Flexibility and Solidarity with Under-resourced Immigrant Families During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel coronavirus has added new anxieties and forms of grieving to the myriad practical and emotional burdens already present in the lives of underserved and uninsured immigrant families and communities. In this article, we relate our experiences since the COVID-19 crisis to the lessons we have learned over time as mental health professionals working with families in no-cost, student-managed community comprehensive health clinics in academic-community partnerships. We compare and contrast the learnings of flexibility of time, space, procedures, or attendance we acquired in this clinical community setting during regular times, with the new challenges families and therapists face, and the adaptations needed to continue to work with our clients in culturally responsive and empowering ways during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe families, students, professionals, promotoras (community links), and IT support staff joining together in solidarity as the creative problem solvers of new possibilities when families do not have access to Wi-Fi, smartphones, or computers, or suffer overcrowding and lack of privacy. We describe many anxieties related to economic insecurity or fear of facing death alone, but also how to visualize expanding possibilities in styles of parenting or types of emotional support among family members as elements of hope that may endure beyond these unprecedented tragic times of loss and uncertainty. El novedoso coronavirus ha agregado nuevas ansiedades y formas de duelo a la infinidad de cargas emocionales y prÃ¡cticas ya presentes en las vidas de las familias y las comunidades de inmigrantes marginados que no tienen seguro. En este artÃ­culo, relacionamos nuestras experiencias desde la crisis de la COVID-19 con las lecciones que hemos aprendido en el transcurso del tiempo como profesionales de salud mental que trabajamos con familias en clÃ­nicas comunitarias de atenciÃ³n integral de la salud gratuitas y administradas por estudiantes en asociaciones acadÃ©mico-comunitarias. Comparamos y contrastamos los conocimientos de flexibilidad del tiempo, del espacio, de los procedimientos o de la asistencia que adquirimos en este entorno clÃ­nico comunitario durante momentos habituales con los nuevos desafÃ­os que enfrentan las familias y los terapeutas, y las adaptaciones necesarias para continuar trabajando con nuestros pacientes de maneras que respondan a sus necesidades culturales y los empoderen durante la pandemia de la COVID-19. Describimos a las familias, a los alumnos, a los profesionales, a las promotoras (vÃ­nculos comunitarios) y al personal de asistencia en tecnologÃ­as informÃ¡ticas que se han unido en solidaridad como solucionadores creativos de problemas ofreciendo nuevas posibilidades cuando las familias no tienen acceso a wifi, a telÃ©fonos inteligentes o a computadoras, o sufren el hacinamiento y la falta de privacidad.

"Anxiety and depression and its correlates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke-out in Wuhan China in December 2019, and spread throughout the entire country within a short time. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19. This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety. A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score. Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety.

This study examines youth mental health and substance use during the pandemic period. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 622 youth participants across existing clinical and community cohorts. Using the National Institute of Mental Health-developed CRISIS tool and other measures, participants reported on the impacts of COVID-19 on their mental health, substance use, and other constructs. Reports of prepandemic mental health compared to intrapandemic mental health show a statistically significant deterioration of mental health across clinical and community samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), with greater deterioration in the community sample. A total of 68.4% of youth in the clinical sample and 39.9% in the community sample met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder. Substance use declined in both clinical and community samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), although 23.2% of youth in the clinical sample and 3.0% in the community sample met screening criteria for a substance use disorder. Participants across samples report substantial mental health service disruptions (48.7% and 10.8%) and unmet support needs (44.1% and 16.2%). Participants report some positive impacts, are using a variety of coping strategies to manage their wellness, and shared a variety of ideas of strategies to support youth during the pandemic. Among youth with histories of mental health concerns, the pandemic context poses a significant risk for exacerbation of need. In addition, youth may experience the onset of new difficulties. We call on service planners to attend to youth mental health during COVID-19 by bolstering the accessibility of services. Moreover, there is an urgent need to engage young people as coresearchers to understand and address the impacts of the pandemic and the short, medium, and long terms.","Hawke, Barbic, Voineskos, Szatmari, Cleverley, Hayes, Relihan, Daley, Courtney, Cheung, Darnay, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743720940562","20200714","COVID-19; adolescent; mental health; pandemics; substance use; young adult; youth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Support Groups and Individual Mental Health Care via Video Conferencing for Frontline Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous stress on the mental health of frontline health care workers. Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress. We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians, resident physicians, and nursing staff, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members and the stress of social distancing. Later, the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician-patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.","Viswanathan, Myers, Fanous","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.014","20200717","COVID; health care workers; mental health; support; telehealth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"[Telepsychiatry in adults and adolescents: a useful tool against CoViD-19]","CoViD-19 is a disease caused by the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), originated from China in December 2019. In March 2020, CoViD-19 was declared a pandemic, having spread all over the word. The psychological impact of CoViD-19 disease must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected. Furhermore quarantine for coronavirus has serious psychological side effects, such as depression and anxiety that are more likely to occur and worsen. Furhermore quarantine reduces the availability of psychiatric and psychological interventions. The evidence base for telepsychiatry is growing in adults and adolescents. A growing body of literature suggests that use of telepsychiatry to provide mental health services has the potential to remove geographic barriers between patients and providers and improves quality care. It has increased the volume of patients that physicians can reach and diagnose, as well as allowing them to treat patients.","Prisco, Prisco, Donnarumma","https://doi.org/10.1701/3407.33923","20200724","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Death; Betacoronavirus; Caregivers; Child; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry; Psychology, Adolescent; Psychology, Child; Quarantine; Stress, Psychological; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Belief in a COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory as a Predictor of Mental Health and Well-Being of Health Care Workers in Ecuador: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, social media platforms have become active sites for the dissemination of conspiracy theories that provide alternative explanations of the cause of the pandemic, such as secret plots by powerful and malicious groups. However, the association of individuals' beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. This paper identifies belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction among health care workers. This finding will enable mental health services to better target and provide help to mentally vulnerable health care workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Zhang, Jahanshahi, Alvarez-Risco, Dai, Li, Ibarra","https://doi.org/10.2196/20737","20200730","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Latin America; conspiracy; coronavirus; health care worker; mental health; prediction; psychiatric identification; social media; well-being; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ecuador; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and Telepsychiatry: Development of Evidence-Based Guidance for Clinicians","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) presents unique challenges in health care, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face-to-face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. The aim of this paper is to produce an open-access, easy-to-consult, and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarized the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and detailed textboxes with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary textboxes are also available on an open-access webpage, which is regularly updated. These findings reflected the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and included guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance, and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focused on practical implementation and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combinations with other digital technologies such as apps (eg, from the US Food and Drug Administration, the National Health Service Apps Library, and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Although some special populations such as child and adolescent, and older adult, and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder, and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, the initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organizations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organizational change in the short- and long-term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step but will need cultural change to implement as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement but as a parallel and complementary form of delivering therapy with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19, and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Ostinelli, Macdonald, Cipriani","https://doi.org/10.2196/21108","20200831","COVID-19; digital mental health; evidence-based guidance; mental health; systematic review; telepsychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms.

"Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project","Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020. Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified. Current psychological distress levels are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.","Van Rheenen, Meyer, Neill, Phillipou, Tan, Toh, Rossell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.037","20200824","Alcohol use; Bipolar disorder; Coronavirus; Exercise; Major depressive disorder; sleep; Adult; Australia; Bipolar Disorder; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Mood Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Psychotic Disorders; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life in clinically stable patients with COVID-19","High risk of mental health problems is associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P&lt;0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P&lt;0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19.

"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p&lt;0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p&lt;0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. Our results suggest an elevated prevalence of depressive symptom in quarantined general individuals in Shenzhen.

"An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in china during the outbreak of COVID-19","The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87â€‚Â±â€‚15.79) and (29.27â€‚Â±â€‚19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099-1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209-2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252-7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609-0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923-0.951). Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.","Duan, Shao, Wang, Huang, Miao, Yang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029","20200824","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Anxiety; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Well-Being Index (WBI) for schools: A brief measure of adolescents' mental health","Schools are increasingly concerned with the well-being of the whole child - likely, more so since the COVID-19 pandemic - and goals here were to document the psychometric properties of a brief new measure of adolescent mental health, the Well-Being Index (WBI). The measure assesses 4 symptom areas, 2 each of internalizing and externalizing symptoms-Depression, Anxiety, Rule-Breaking, and Substance Use-and an optional scale on Isolation at School. A total of 2,444 students from 2 high schools completed the WBI, the Youth Self-Report (YSR), and other related measures. Alpha coefficients showed acceptable internal consistency, with values for the 5 WBI subscales at .83, .84, .78, .79, and .74, respectively. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated consistent factorial validity. Correlations with corresponding YSR subscales indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Lee, Fitzgerald, Oosterhoff, Sevi, Shook","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001962","20200713",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Responding to Health Care Professionals' Mental Health Needs During COVID-19 Through the Rapid Implementation of Project ECHO","The COVID-19 pandemic can cause significant mental health distress amongst health care professionals (HCPs). We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project ECHO Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs' manage COVID-19 distress. We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean=4.26). HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sockalingam, Clarkin, Serhal, Pereira, Crawford","https://doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000311","20200713",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Tobacco smoking cessation in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Tobacco smoking is more prevalent among people who experience mental illness. It is therefore a prominent issue for psychiatric inpatient units. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many psychiatric inpatient units are no longer granting leave and outdoor smoking breaks, prompting the question of whether to allow tobacco smoking or enforce smoking bans in mental health services. There is currently mixed evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 cases, potentially due to current small sample sizes. Considering the benefits of smoking cessation in this vulnerable population, the current pandemic should be used as an opportunity to further enforce smoking cessation in mental health facilities and encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside cessation counseling.","Seiler, Swamy, Xiao, Yun","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1791379","20200713","COVID-19; Tobacco; smoking","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Is the mental health of young students and their family members affected during the quarantine period? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Albania","WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: Mental health is deteriorated during the quarantine period. Mental health status is affected by the quarantine even after the end of it and for an extended period. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: Depression levels among nursing/midwifery students during the quarantine period are high. Depression levels among students' family members during the quarantine period are high. Those who are not satisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures and those who believe that COVID-19 and quarantine can cause problems on health, have elevated levels of depression. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period should be a priority for the healthcare system. Offering mental health first aid training and support can improve the mental health status of students and their family members. ABSTRACT: Introduction The use of quarantine method has a significant impact on mental health status. Aim This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members' during the quarantine period of COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used. Institutional e-mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. Results In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ-9 score was 6.220 (SDÂ =Â 5.803) and 6.280 (SDÂ =Â 5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID-19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. Discussion Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members. Broader population studies are necessary to safeguard these results. Implications for Practice Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period is of paramount significance. Mental health first aid training and support could benefit both students and their parents significantly. Additionally, follow-up services after the end of quarantine are recommended.","Mechili, Saliaj, Kamberi, Girvalaki, Peto, Patelarou, Bucaj, Patelarou","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12672","20200811","COVID-19; PHQ-9; depression; family members; quarantine; university students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Increased generalized anxiety, depression and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Germany","Since the first cases of the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 were reported in December 2019 in China, the virus has spread in most countries. The aim of the present study was to assess initial data on the mental health burden of the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany and collected complete datasets from 15Â 704 German residents aged 18Â years and over. Besides demographics, generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2) and psychological distress (DT) were assessed. Furthermore, COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were covered. Significantly increased symptoms were highly prevalent in all dimensions: generalized anxiety (44.9%), depression (14.3%), psychological distress (65.2%) and COVID-19-related fear (59%). Females and younger people reported higher mental burden. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 are negatively associated with mental health burden. However, the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 is positively associated with increased COVID-19-related fear. The provision of appropriate psychological interventions for those in need and the provision of transparency and comprehensible information are crucial during the current pandemic.","BÃ¤uerle, Teufel, Musche, WeismÃ¼ller, Kohler, Hetkamp, DÃ¶rrie, Schweda, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa106","20200901","COVID-19; COVID-19-related fear; depression; generalized anxiety; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Drug-drug interactions may affect individuals with OUD who are co-administered medications for OUD and medications for COVID-19, particularly due to cardiac adverse effects. <i>Conclusions/Importance:</i> There are plausible biological mechanisms for potentially worsened outcomes in patients with OUD who contract COVID-19; these mechanisms require further study, and should be considered in individuals with OUD.","Schimmel, Manini","https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2020.1791184","20200730","COVID; OUD; Opioid Use Disorder; coronavirus; risk factors; Adaptive Immunity; Analgesics, Opioid; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Interactions; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunocompromised Host; Methadone; Opioid-Related Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prognosis; Respiratory Insufficiency","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Lessons from dermatology about inflammatory responses in Covid-19","The SARS-Cov-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus composed of 16 non-structural proteins (NSP 1-16) with specific roles in the replication of coronaviruses. NSP3 has the property to block host innate immune response and to promote cytokine expression. NSP5 can inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and NSP16 prevents MAD5 recognition, depressing the innate immunity. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a 'cytokine storm'. These systemic conditions share polymorphous cutaneous lesions where innate immune system is involved in the histopathological findings with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hyperferritinemia, increased serum levels of D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, reactive-C-protein and serum A amyloid. It is described that several polymorphous cutaneous lesions similar to erythema pernio, urticarial rashes, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicles lesions, and purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema.

"Risk factors for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel: Loneliness, age, gender, and health status play an important role","Research on the psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being conducted in various countries. This study aimed to examine risk factors for mental health problems among Israeli adults during this crisis. A total of 204 participants took part in the study. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and various questions related to quarantine, pre-existing health issues, and worries related to the virus. The study took place during the last two weeks of March 2020. The majority of participants reported relatively high levels of perceived stress and corona-related worries, but low levels of anxiety. Female gender, younger age, corona-related loneliness, and pre-existing chronic illness were all related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of quality of life. While considering the preliminary nature of these results, the current study highlights risk factors for psychological distress in light of the corona pandemic. Attention should be given to sociodemographic variables that were identified as related to psychological distress, as well as to the important role of loneliness, when screening and treating people during this crisis. More research is needed in order to fully understand the scope and correlates of psychological difficulties during these challenging times.","Horesh, Kapel Lev-Ari, Hasson-Ohayon","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12455","20200807","COVID-19; pandemic; quality of life; risk factors; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological Impact and Associated Factors During the Initial Stage of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Among the General Population in Spain","The outbreak of COVID-19 in Spain started at the end of February. By 9th April 2020 Spain was the second country in confirmed cases and in deaths. On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission. During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions. This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts. This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (<i>N</i> = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels. We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants' mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h. Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities. About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed. Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms. What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic. We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health. These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.","RodrÃ­guez-Rey, Garrido-Hernansaiz, Collado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01540","20200714","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pandemic; psychological crisis intervention; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Debate: #Together despite the distance","The pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a major global impact on the healthcare systems worldwide as they deal with the surge of critically ill persons. Additionally, the preventative measure of stay-at-home orders and closure of nonessential businesses has caused the disruption of entire communities. The child/youth mental health workforce bears the additional burden of the disruption of the systems-based practice crucial to the successful provision of mental health services. Major sources of stress for the workforce include: (a) a threat to the worker's personal/family health and life (traumatic injury), (b) a loss of colleagues or threat to professional mastery and identity (grief injury), (c) an inner conflict between ones' values and aspirations and what they are able to accomplish in their work (moral injury), and (d) fatigue, simply feeling worn out by the relentless work and need, without time for rest and recovery (fatigue injury). The rapid transformation of the in-person to virtual practice by the implementation of telehealth/telephonic sessions has eroded the boundary between personal/professional life and created a new Zoom fatigue.","Chrisman","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12406","20200827","COVID-19; disaster; mental health; pandemic; stress; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child Health; Coronavirus Infections; Grief; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Telecommunications","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Debate: COVID-19 and psychological well-being of children and adolescents in Italy","Italy was the first country in Europe to deal with COVID-19. Measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus were based mainly on quarantine and social distancing, with dramatic economic, social and psychological consequences. Since March, Italian children and adolescents are facing school closures, which have caused a disruption in the daily lives of millions of young people and their families. To date, despite the slow reopening, the government has decided to maintain school closures for the entire academic year, leaving the future of young people in uncertainty. There is already some evidence that quarantine and social isolation are having negative impact on children's and adolescents' psychological well-being. Moreover, this situation will mainly affect those children and adolescents with pre-existing vulnerabilities and those suffering of mental disorders. It is imperative to keep young people's needs at the core of reconstruction plans, allowing them to return to school safely, and providing them with some strategies to heal and dealing with this stressful and potentially traumatic situation.","Caffo, Scandroglio, Asta","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12405","20200827","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); adolescents; children; mental health; psychological well-being; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Betacoronavirus; Child; Child Health; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Italy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychology, Adolescent; Psychology, Child; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep quality in university students and administration staff","In Italy, lockdown due to COVID-19 health emergency started on March 10 and partially ended on May 3rd, 2020. There was a significant increase of psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness, and worsening of quality of sleep in the general population. Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84â€‰Â±â€‰2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02â€‰Â±â€‰12.46). we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students. In workers, we observed a prevalence of maintenance insomnia before COVID-19 of 24% that significantly increase during COVID-19 reaching 40%, while workers with difficulties in sleep initiation were only 15% that increased to 42%. In our sample, 27.8% showed depressive symptoms, while 34.3% showed anxious symptoms, in particular in students. The impact of lockdown was greater in students than in workers, and in females than in males. Concerning the psycho-emotional aspects, about one-third of our sample showed depressive or anxious symptoms.

"Love in the Time of COVID-19: Sexual Function and Quality of Life Analysis During the Social Distancing Measures in a Group of Italian Reproductive-Age Women","The beginning of 2020 was characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The world governments have adopted restrictive measures to reduce the spread of infection. These measures could affect the sexual function and quality of life of women living with their partner. The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28-50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3Â Â±Â 1.9 to 2.3Â Â±Â 1.8, mean difference:Â -3.9Â Â±Â 1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2Â Â±Â 4.2 vs 19.2Â Â±Â 3.3, mean difference:Â -9.7Â Â±Â 2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3Â Â±Â 5.5 vs 20.1Â Â±Â 5.2, mean difference: 10.8Â Â±Â 3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2Â Â±Â 10.2 to 64.2Â Â±Â 11.8 4Â weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference:Â -17.8Â Â±Â 6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity â‰¥1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the homeÂ +Â university educational levelÂ +Â parity â‰¥1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

"Anxiety and Depression of Nurses in a North West Province in China During the Period of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Outbreak","To investigate the anxiety and depression levels of frontline clinical nurses working in 14 hospitals in Gansu Province, China, during this period. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online between February 7 and 10, 2020, with a convenience sample of 22,034 nurses working in 14 prefecture and city hospitals in Gansu Province, located in northwest China. A self-reported questionnaire with four parts (demographic characteristics, general questions related to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, self-rating anxiety scale, and self-rating depression scale) was administered. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and SDs were computed. The associations between anxiety and depression with sociodemographic characteristics, work-related concerns, and impacts were analyzed, followed by multiple stepwise linear regression to identify factors that best predicted the nurses' anxiety and depression levels. A total of 21,199 questionnaires were checked to be valid, with an effective recovery rate of 96.21%. The mean Â± SD age of the respondents was 31.89 Â± 7.084 years, and the mean Â± SD length of service was 9.40 Â± 7.638 years. The majority of the respondents were female (98.6%) and married (73.1%). Some demographic characteristics, related concerns, and impacts of COVID-19 were found to be significantly associated with both anxiety (p &lt; .001) and depression (p &lt; .001). Nurses who needed to take care of children or elderly relatives, took leave from work because they were worried about COVID-19, avoided contact with family and friends, and wanted to obtain more COVID-19-related knowledge had higher levels of both anxiety and depression. Results show that nurses faced with the COVID-19 outbreak are at risk for experiencing anxiety and depression. Demographic background, psychosocial factors, and work-related factors predicted the psychological responses. The family responsibilities and burdens of women may explain the higher levels of anxiety and depression among nurses with these obligations as compared to those without. On the other hand, nurses who chose not to take leave from work or who did not avoid going to work during this period were less anxious and depressed. Professional commitment might be a protective factor for adverse psychological responses. It is pertinent to provide emotional support for nurses and recognize their professional commitment in providing service to people in need.","Han, Wong, She, Li, Yang, Jiang, Ruan, Su, Ma, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12590","20200819",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3Â years in 10-40%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.","Preti, Di Mattei, Perego, Ferrari, Mazzetti, Taranto, Di Pierro, Madeddu, Calati","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01166-z","20200717","COVID-19; Epidemic; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Personnel; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Influenza, Human; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"When altruists cannot help: the influence of altruism on the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The positive predictive effect of altruism on physical and psychological well-being has been extensively demonstrated in previous studies, but few studies have examined the effect of altruism on negative mental health outcomes when altruists cannot perform altruistic behaviours. This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mageâ€‰=â€‰19.76â€‰Â±â€‰2.23â€‰years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.16, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.134, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (tâ€‰=â€‰7.68, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings enrich theories of altruism and provide valuable insight into the influence of altruism on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Feng, Zong, Yang, Gu, Dong, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00587-y","20200716","Altruism; COVID-19; Mental health; Negative affect; Perceived risk; Adolescent; Affect; Altruism; Anxiety; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Self Report; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (<i>p</i> = .008) and isolation (<i>p</i> = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that level of education, avoiding going to crowded places, eye, nose and mouth organs are sensitive organs to the virus, keeping physical distance due to epidemic affect by COVID-19 virus, isolation and treatment of people reduce the spread of COVID-19 virus and 14-days period of time, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected person, occupational status, health education programme needed and antibody treatment variables were significantly associated with fatigue after adjusting for age, gender and income variables. The current study provides valuable information for policymakers and mental health professionals worldwide regarding associations between the mental health of individuals and the ongoing outbreak, COVÄ°D-19.","Morgul, Bener, Atak, Akyel, AktaÅŸ, Bhugra, Ventriglio, Jordan","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020941889","20200715","COVID-19; KAP study; fatigue; infectious disease; pandemic; perceptions; public health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Compliance with Precautionary Measures: Age and Sex Matter","Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18-29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors. Furthermore, it has implications for policy makers demonstrating the need for effective mental health programs and guidance for the implementation of PM as a public health strategy.","Solomou, Constantinidou","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144924","20200717","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; precautionary measures; psychological effects; quality of life; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cyprus; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Compliance; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universal Precautions; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Incremental validity of coronaphobia: Coronavirus anxiety explains depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety","The adverse psychological effects of COVID-19 have increased globally. Moreover, the psychological toll may be worsening for this health crisis due to the growing numbers of mass deaths and unemployment levels. Coronaphobia, a relatively new pandemic-related construct, has been shown to be strongly related to functional impairment and psychological distress. However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.","Lee, Jobe, Mathis, Gibbons","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268","20200821","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronaphobia; Coronavirus; Death anxiety; Depression; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Fear; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mentality and behavior in COVID-19 emergency status in Japan: Influence of personality, morality and ideology","The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 and severely influenced society. In response, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on 7th April in seven prefectures. The study conducted an immediate survey on 8th April to record the response of the general public to the first emergency status due to epidemics. The study hypothesized that personality traits, moral foundation, and political ideology can influence people's mentality, cognition, and behavior toward COVID-19. Based on a nationwide dataset of 1856 respondents (male = 56.3%, Mage = 46.7, emergency regions = 49.9%), the study found that personality, morality, and ideology altered mental health status and motivated behaviors toward COVID-19. Neuroticism and avoiding harm involved cognition and behavior through various means. The study also found significant differences among demographic groups. Results are informative and contributive to the governance and management of, and aid for, individual responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Qian, Yahara","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235883","20200717","Attitude; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Morals; Pandemics; Personality; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological health, sleep quality, and coping styles to stress facing the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To understand Wuhan residents' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 epidemic and offer a reference point for interventions, an online questionnaire survey was conducted. It included the Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), Athens Insomnia Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Categorical data were reported as numbers and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between demographic factors and anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style. A total of 1242 Wuhan residents investigated, 27.5% had anxiety, 29.3% had depression, 30.0% had a sleep disorder, and 29.8% had a passive response to COVID-19. Being female was the risk factor for anxiety (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.62) and sleep disorder (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.36); being married was associated with anxiety (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.75); having a monthly income between 1000 and 5000 CNY (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.44, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.83, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.61) or &gt;5000 CNY (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.47, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.45, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.14) was a risk factor for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder; not exercising (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.45, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.71, ORâ€‰=â€‰1. 85, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.71) was a common risk factor for anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style; and having a higher education level (bachelor's degree and above) (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.40) was associated with having a sleep disorder. Wuhan residents' psychological status and sleep quality were relatively poorer than they were before the COVID-19 epidemic; however, the rate of passive coping to stress was relatively higher.","Fu, Wang, Zou, Guo, Lu, Yan, Mao","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00913-3","20200720","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sleep Wake Disorders; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Challenges and recommendations for mental health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the experience of China's First University-based mental health team","Coronavirus Disease is impacting the entire world. As the first country that has needed to confront this disease, China has responded with unprecedented and hugely successful public health initiatives. Almost simultaneous with the awareness of the potential for widespread loss of life, the first Chinese university recognizing the likely psychological impacts of COVID-19, assembled the first university-based professional team to offer pandemic-related mental health services to the Chinese public. This paper describes the work that we provided and the challenges encountered. The challenges are described in four contexts: the organizational/systemic level, the technical perspective, the therapeutic process, and the ethical aspects.

"Differences in Sense of Belonging, Pride, and Mental Health in the Daegu Metropolitan Region due to COVID-19: Comparison between the Presence and Absence of National Disaster Relief Fund","Korea's Daegu Metropolitan City once had the second highest rate of COVID-19 infection after Wuhan in China. Following the outbreak, the government provided the first national disaster relief fund to citizens as financial aid. This study investigated whether the sense of regional belonging, pride, and mental health among 550 citizens of Daegu differed between the times before and after COVID-19, based on the presence or absence of the disaster relief fund. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and <i>t</i>-tests were conducted using the SPSS 25.0 program. Results showed that the sense of belonging was higher after COVID-19 than before, while pride was lower. Individuals who received the disaster relief fund showed higher levels of regional belonging and pride with statistical significance. The prevalence of melancholy and depression increased after COVID-19, but the presence or absence of the fund did not lead to a significant difference. Thus, in case of a future national disaster level, provision of the disaster relief fund can raise the sense of regional belonging and pride, in order to elicit communication among local residents toward overcoming difficulties. Furthermore, during challenging disaster situations, central and local governments should provide diverse programs for the citizens' mental health care.","Kim, Cho, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134910","20200717","COVID-19; Daegu; disaster relief fund; mental health; pride; sense of belonging; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Disasters; Emotions; Female; Financial Management; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Republic of Korea; Sociological Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Changes in Weight and Nutritional Habits in Adults with Obesity during the &quot;Lockdown&quot; Period Caused by the COVID-19 Virus Emergency","Our aim is evaluating the changes in weight and dietary habits in a sample of outpatients with obesity after 1 month of enforced lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. In this observational retrospective study, the patients of our Obesity Unit were invited to answer to a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire relative to weight changes, working activity, exercise, dietary habits, and conditions potentially impacting on nutritional choices. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations among weight/BMI changes and the analyzed variables. A total of 150 subjects (91.5%) completed the questionnaire. Mean self-reported weight gain was â‰ˆ1.5 kg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Lower exercise, self-reported boredom/solitude, anxiety/depression, enhanced eating, consumption of snacks, unhealthy foods, cereals, and sweets were correlated with a significantly higher weight gain.

"Physical health among people with serious mental illness in the face of COVID-19: Concerns and mitigation strategies","COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed &quot;non-urgent&quot; and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.","Melamed, Hahn, Agarwal, Taylor, Mulsant, Selby","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.013","20200903","Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Chronic medical conditions; Health services; Physical health; Primary care; Quality of health care; Schizophrenia; Serious mental illness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Understanding the Perceived Mental Health of Canadians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While the physical health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are regularly publicly available, the mental health toll on Canadians is unknown. This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health. These findings point to particular risks for lower perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight various concerns of Canadians which may be associated with mental health, in particular, family stress in the home.","Findlay, Arim, Kohen","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000400003-eng","20200724","COVID-19; concerns; family stress; perceived mental health; social determinants of mental health; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Canada; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological and Ocular Surface State of Ophthalmologists and Ophthalmic Nurses Working With Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019","The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70â€¯000) and 0.07% (21 of 30â€¯000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70â€¯000; 21 of 35â€¯000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90â€‰(2.30), 7.38â€‰(2.19), 24.52â€‰(5.86), and 43.90â€‰(3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67â€‰(3.04), 9.38â€‰(2.64), 21.48â€‰(6.15), and 40.05â€‰(6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67â€‰(2.89), 4.90â€‰(3.15), 12.76â€‰(7.27), and 38.79â€‰(7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67â€‰(3.20), 4.33â€‰(3.23), 10.10â€‰(7.62), and 41.52â€‰(5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.2289","20200714",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

So far there have been no studies concerning pandemic influence on alcohol consumption in medical professionals in quarantine or isolation. The 12 point 'online' ALCOVID survey with a cover letter was designed and addressed to physicians, recruited online via accessible networks, who underwent isolation or quarantine during recent pandemic. The AUDIT-3 scale was included. A representative trial of 113 physicians participated in the study. Over 53% of screened doctors revealed that the amounts of the consumed alcohol have escalated; almost 20% of subjects binged over seven standard drinks for one occasion. Close to every second used six or more drinks on one occasion. Over 40% used alcohol more than four times per week. Female used alcohol more often and more standard drinks per occasion. Male binged more. Anxiety and hopelessness were the most common motives to drink. Alcohol consumption in physicians in quarantine has threateningly increased. It is important to identify the group of people at the risk of problem drinking and dependence development, especially when it concerns key professional branches in the fight against the current crisis.","Silczuk","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa110","20200831","COVID-19; alcohol use; coronavirus; lockdown; physicians; quarantine; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Anxiety; Attitude of Health Personnel; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Poland; Quarantine; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice in India: Results of an Anonymized National Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for medical professionals throughout the world to tackle the rapidly changing scenario. The objective of this survey was to analyze the change in neurosurgical practice in India following the COVID-19 outbreak and assess its impact on practising neurosurgeons. Between May 7<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated amongst practising neurosurgeons across the country by social media and e-mails, regarding changes in the patterns of patients seen, adaptations made in their practice, effect on surgeries performed, financial burden, and impact on their personal lives. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for correlations between the changes observed and independent factors such as hospital affiliations, teaching professions, and neurosurgical experience. Our survey showed a drastic fall in the number of neurosurgical patients seen in the outpatient department (OPD) as well as the number of surgeries performed. A drop of 76.25% was seen in OPD patients (P = 0.000) and that of 70.59% in surgeries performed (P = 0.000). There was no uniformity among the neurosurgeons in the number of COVID-19 tests being done before elective/emergency surgery and in the use of protective gear while examining patients. Private practitioners were more affected financially as compared to those in the government sector. The pandemic has affected the research work of 53.23% of all respondents, with those in the teaching profession (70.96%) more affected than those in the non-teaching profession (24.67%). Evidence-based policies, screening COVID-19 tests with better sensitivity, and better-quality personal protective equipment kits in adequate numbers are required to protect our medical professionals from COVID-19. Mental health issues among neurosurgeons may also be an issue, this being a high risk speciality and should be closely watched for.","Venkataram, Goyal, Dash, Chandra, Chaturvedi, Raheja, Singla, Sardhara, Singh, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.289004","20200717","COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019); India; neurosurgical practice; personal protective equipment; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; India; Male; Mass Screening; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Association between social support and anxiety among pregnant women in the third trimester during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Qingdao, China: The mediating effect of risk perception","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a threat to the mental health of pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support and anxiety, and the mediating effect of risk perception during the COVID-19 epidemic in the third trimester pregnant women in Qingdao, China. From 16 to 21 February 2020, an online survey was conducted, which collected the information on demographic data, anxiety, social support and risk perception to COVID-19 of women with established medical records in the ambulatory of the Department of Obstetrics at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Anxiety was assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), social support was assessed by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and risk perception was assessed by a self-designed questionnaire. This study had 308 participants with an average of 31.02 Â± 3.91 years. During the period of prevention and control of the epidemic, most pregnant women adopted protective measures, such as wearing masks (97.4%), washing hands frequently (88.3%) and staying at home (76.3%). The average SAS, SSRS and risk perception scores of the participants were 42.45 Â± 6.98, 44.60 Â± 7.00 and 21.60 Â± 5.74, respectively. The total effect of maternal social support on anxiety was -2.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): -4.40 ~ -1.44, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.001), the direct effect was -1.44 (95% CI: -2.74 ~ -0.35, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.05) and the indirect effect was -1.19 (95% CI: -2.49 ~ -0.51, <i>p</i> &lt; .001). The third trimester pregnant women had a high level of social support, a medium level of risk perception to COVID-19 and were susceptible to anxiety. Risk perception played a mediating role between social support and anxiety.","Yue, Liu, Wang, Zhang, Wu, Li, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020941567","20200711","COVID-19; Social support; anxiety; pregnant women; risk perception","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Use of technology by orientation and mobility professionals in Australia and Malaysia before COVID-19","Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) professionals teach people with low vision or blindness to use specialist assistive technologies to support confident travel, but many O&amp;M clients now prefer a smartphone. This study aimed to investigate what technology O&amp;M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&amp;M technologies and build capacity in the international O&amp;M profession. A technology survey was completed by professionals (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰36) attending O&amp;M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&amp;M specialists (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&amp;M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&amp;M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&amp;M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&amp;M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&amp;M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&amp;M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&amp;M tele-practice. O&amp;M technology could support comprehensive O&amp;M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&amp;M clients with complex needs. Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&amp;M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&amp;M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&amp;M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&amp;M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&amp;M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&amp;M professionals upgrading technology in Australia. Comprehensive training for O&amp;M specialists is needed in Malaysia to meet the travel needs of clients with low vision or blindness who also have physical, cognitive, sensory or mental health complications.","Deverell, Bhowmik, Lau, Al Mahmud, Sukunesan, Islam, McCarthy, Meyer","https://doi.org/10.1080/17483107.2020.1785565","20200709","Orientation and mobility; assistive technology; blind; electronic travel aids; low vision; smartphone; technology training","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental Health During the Covid-19 Outbreak in China: a Meta-Analysis","Covid-19 has started to spread within China since the end of December 2019. Despite government's immediate actions and strict control, more and more people were infected every day. As such a contagious virus can spread easily and rapidly between people, the whole country was put into lockdown and people were forced into isolation. In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data. The results showed that the incidence of anxiety was 25% (95% CI: 0.19-0.32), and the incidence of depression was 28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.38). Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these incidence estimates. Subgroup analysis included the study population and assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Owing to the significant heterogeneity detected in studies regarding this pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, we must interpret the results with caution. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system, which integrating epidemiological monitoring, screening and psychological crisis prevention and interventions.","Ren, Huang, Pan, Huang, Wang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09796-5","20200711","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Mental health; Meta-analysis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The experience of women infected by the COVID-19 during pregnancy in Brazil: a qualitative study protocol","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly infectious, with the recent World Health Organization decree confirming a global public health emergency. The outcomes related to maternal and fetal health among pregnant women infected with the virus are still poorly understood. The world population has been waiting for answers and remains constantly alert about the pandemic's progress. It is not yet known what impact this pandemic experience will have on the population's mental health, especially pregnant women. We aim to understand and discuss the experiences of women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, in relation to the illness process, community relations, and social media influences. This is a qualitative study in which we will interview women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy and received medical care from a tertiary university hospital specializing in women's health in Brazil. We will use the techniques of Semi-Directed Interviews of Open and In-depth Questions, socio-demographic and health data sheets, and Field Diaries. We will use purposive sampling and the criterion of theoretical saturation for its construction. The interviews will be conducted by phone or video call, with audio recorded for later transcription. The treatment of the data will be completed through Thematic Analysis and discussed in light of the Health Psychology framework, with the production of categories that answer the proposed research questions. It is expected that the results contribute to the understanding about the demands that come to the health professional of women infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy in a pandemic situation.

"Caspase1/11 signaling affects muscle regeneration and recovery following ischemia, and can be modulated by chloroquine","We previously showed that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases inflammatory cleaved caspase-1 activity in myocytes, and that caspase-1/11 is protective in sterile liver injury. However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. C57Bl/6â€‰J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50â€‰mg/kg IP every 2nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7â€‰days. After 21â€‰days, in situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","Sachdev, Ferrari, Cui, Pius, Sahu, Reynolds, Liao, Sun, Shinde, Ambrosio, Shiva, Loughran, Scott","https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00190-2","20200720","Autophagy; Glycolysis; Inflammasome; Ischemic muscle; Lysosomal inhibition; Oxidative phosphorylation; Animals; Autophagosomes; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Caspase 1; Caspases, Initiator; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Glycolysis; Ischemia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Muscle Cells; Muscle Development; Muscle, Skeletal; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pandemics; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Pneumonia, Viral; Regeneration; Signal Transduction","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How do Funeral Practices Impact Bereaved Relatives' Mental Health, Grief and Bereavement? A Mixed Methods Review with Implications for COVID-19","Those who are bereaved during the current COVID-19 pandemic are subject to restrictions on funeral sizes and practices. We conducted a rapid review synthesising the quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, KSR Evidence, and COVID-related resources were conducted. 805 records were screened; 17 studies of variable quality were included. Current evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes is inconclusive. Five observational studies found benefits from funeral participation while six did not. However, qualitative research provides additional insight: the benefit of after-death rituals including funerals depends on the ability of the bereaved to shape those rituals and say goodbye in a way which is meaningful for them. Findings highlight the important role of funeral officiants during the pandemic. Research is needed to better understand the experiences and sequalae of grief and bereavement during COVID-19.","Burrell, Selman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222820941296","20200728","bereavement; burial; funerals; grief; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Survey on Knowledge and Psychological Crisis Related to COVID-19 among Nursing Staff: A Cross-sectional Study","Background: Since December 2019, the prevalence of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in the world. Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of infection by coronavirus. Therefore, there is a urging need to assess their mental health condition and set up appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and psychological crisis related to COVID-19 among nursing staff, and to provide evidence for targeted training and psychological intervention. This cross-sectional online survey study was performed in a class three grade A general hospital from a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire of COVID-19 related prevention and control knowledge and the Triages Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological crisis. SPSS 23.0 was applied to compute the collected data. A total of 979 nursing staff completed the questionnaire. The results showed that nursing staff have lower number of correct answers of continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (38.7%), debarment criteria (55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (72.8%). The overall score of the TAF was 7.0 (5.0-12.0), and there were statistical significance in scores between different types of personnel, years of work experience and department (P &lt;.05). This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, despite the psychological damage of nursing staff is slight, nurse manager must continue to monitor their mental health and take timely interventions.","Huang, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/20606","20200708",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from patients, caregivers and potential living donors - a qualitative study","Many countries have suspended kidney transplantation programmes during the COVID-19 pandemic because of concerns for patient safety and the shortage of healthcare resources. This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programmes due to COVID-19. We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (nÂ =Â 22), caregivers (nÂ =Â 4) and potential donors (nÂ =Â 5). Transcripts were analysed thematically. We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from health care, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). During the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programmes.","Guha, Tong, Baumgart, Scholes-Robertson, Isbel, Kanellis, Campbell, Coates, Chadban","https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.13697","20200729","COVID-19; coronavirus; patient-centred care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Implementation of Home-Based Telemental Health in a Large Child Psychiatry Department During the COVID-19 Crisis","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Telemental health (TMH) is not well described for mental health service delivery during crises. Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges. Our experience provides a roadmap for establishing a HB-TMH service with focus on rapid implementation. It also demonstrates a role for TMH during (rather than after) future crises when usual community resources are not available.","Sharma, Sasser, Schoenfelder Gonzalez, Vander Stoep, Myers","https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2020.0062","20200903","COVID-19 pandemic; crisis; home-based telemental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence of clinical efficacy. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 Âµmol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarization is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration &gt;150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality in chloroquine self-poisoning. Pharmacokinetic modeling predicts that most high dose regimens trialled in COVID-19 are unlikely to cause serious cardiovascular toxicity. Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are closely-related drugs used for the treatment of malaria and rheumatological conditions, such as lupus. Laboratory tests have indicated that these drugs could also be used against the virus that causes COVID-19. Given the urgent need, these drugs have been fast-tracked into large-scale clinical trials, bypassing the usual stages that would provide estimates for suitable dosage. The dosage is a critical factor in a clinical trial: too low and the drug will not have an effect, too high and the side effects may counteract any potential benefits. Laboratory tests suggest that higher doses of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are needed for treating COVID-19 compared to malaria or lupus. However, there are concerns about the high doses used in some trials, as the drugs can have lethal side effects. Indeed, chloroquine has been used extensively in suicide attempts, particularly in France. To address these concerns, Watson et al. set out to determine the highest dosage of chloroquine (and thus of hydroxychloroquine, approximately) that does not cause unacceptable side effects. First, data was analysed regarding the concentration of chloroquine in the blood of 302 patients who had intentionally overdosed on the drug, since this concentration is tightly correlated with their risk of death. Watson et al. used a statistical model to calculate the maximal chloroquine concentration in a personâ€™s blood associated with a one per cent risk of death. This is taken to be the threshold above which any potential benefit of chloroquine treatment would be outweighed by the possibility of lethal toxicity. Watson et al. also estimated the relationship between chloroquine concentrations and changes in electrocardiogram patterns, which record the electrical activity of the heart. This makes it possible to determine whether a high dose of chloroquine has led to dangerous levels in the blood. Using a mathematical model of how chloroquine is metabolised, Watson et al. predicted that most of the trials that tested chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 did not reach the calculated threshold concentration. An exception was the CloroCovid-19 trial in Brazil, which was stopped early because people in the higher dosage group suffered more heart problems and died in greater numbers than those in the lower dosage group. Two large randomised trials, RECOVERY and SOLIDARITY, have shown no benefit of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19, changing clinical practice worldwide. Both of these trials used high doses resulting in higher hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine concentrations than normally observed in the treatment of malaria or rheumatological conditions. The results from Watson et al demonstrate that the lack of benefit seen in these two large clinical trials is not due to the drug dosage being too high.","Watson, Tarning, Hoglund, Baud, Megarbane, Clemessy, White","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58631","20200821","bayesian; chloroquine; human; human biology; medicine; overdose; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; Adult; Antimalarials; Biotransformation; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Overdose; Drug Repositioning; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Long QT Syndrome; Malaria; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 in a Los Angeles Health System","With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with phased reopening, it is critical to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility and severity of disease in a diverse population to help shape government policies, guide clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research. In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","Chang, Ding, Freund, Johnson, Schwarz, Yabu, Hazlett, Chiang, Wulf, Geschwind, Butte, Pasaniuc","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145581","20200801",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Lithium Toxicity in Two Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Patients","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) isÂ a highly contagious disease, which is currently causing a devastating pandemic resulting in more than millions of infected cases worldwide. Emerging evidence reports the impact of several co-morbidities on the clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19. However, the evidence regarding the association of mental health illnesses and psychiatric treatment on the prognoses of COVID-19 is still lacking. Lithium is a commonly prescribed psychiatric medication that is also well known for its highly lethal toxicity. Many factors can fluctuate the level of lithium, such as drug interaction, illness, and infection.Â Prompt recognition and management of lithium intoxication is required to reduce patients' morbidity and mortality. Currently, there is no report regarding COVID-19 and lithium toxicity. Herein, we are presenting two patients with COVID-19 who initially presented with signs and symptoms of lithium toxicity.Â Our cases emphasize the need for special attention in taking care of patients who are taking lithium during the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, we recommendÂ obtaining lithium levels in all patients who have been taking lithium and have the diagnosis of COVID-19.","Suwanwongse, Shabarek","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8384","20200709","aki; case report; corona virus disease; covid; kidney failure; lithium; toxicity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The mental health of health care workers in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 disease is one of the most destructive events that humanity has witnessed in the 21st century. It has impacted all aspects of life and all segments of populations, including already vulnerable health care providers. This study sought to detect the prevalence of mental health issues in sample of physicians and nurses working in several health facilities in Oman. We gauged the mental health conditions of 509 physicians (38.1%) and nurses (61.9 %) using the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and World Health Organization Well-Being Index. The study revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety and poor psychological well-being, especially among females, young health care workers and those who interacted with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. The outcomes of this study support the handful of studies published during this global health crisis that have found that the mental health of health care workers has been harshly affected and predicted that it will continue, to various degrees, to be affected in the foreseeable future. The results of this study highlight the urgency of providing administrative and psychological support as well as current and accurate information on COVID-19 to health care workers.","Badahdah, Khamis, Al Mahyijari, Al Balushi, Al Hatmi, Al Salmi, Albulushi, Al Noomani","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020939596","20200708","COVID-19; Stress; anxiety; health care workers; well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Secondary Traumatization Outcomes and Associated Factors Among the Health Care Workers Exposed to the COVID-19","Secondary traumatization exposure and mental health conditions of health care workers gained importance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic period. In our study, we aim to research the secondary traumatization and associated factors among health care workers. This cross-sectional study was applied through an online questionnaire using the snowball sampling method. Two hundred fifty-one health care workers from different units/services and 312 non-medical worker adults attended to the research. Health care workers were divided into two groups based on working with COVID-19 patients at the frontline or not. The data were collected via Introductory Information Form, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) between 22 May and 30 May 2020. Among the 563 participants, 251 (44.6%) were health care workers and 312 (55.4%) were non-medical workers. The anxiety, depression and secondary traumatization scores of the frontline health care workers for the COVID-19 were found to be significantly higher than those of the other health workers or non-medical workers (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Also, we found that being a woman, being in the first years of the work, living with a parent, having a chronic disease, having a trauma history and increased social media use are related to having higher scores from the secondary traumatization scale. The secondary traumatization exposure and the mental health conditions of the health care workers directly working with the COVID-19 patients should be taken into consideration. It is important to provide social support, examine and control riskier groups for mental health regularly during the pandemic.","Arpacioglu, Gurler, Cakiroglu","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940742","20200711","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health care workers; risk factors; secondary traumatization","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths in China. Prior research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (M<sub>age</sub> = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the &quot;perceived severity of COVID-19-mental health problems&quot; association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Yang, Dou, Cheung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134820","20200717","COVID-19; cognitive appraisal; public health concerns; resilience; risk factor; self-control; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Self-Control; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Provision of Psychotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Czech, German and Slovak Psychotherapists","Psychotherapists around the world are facing an unprecedented situation with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To combat the rapid spread of the virus, direct contact with others has to be avoided when possible. Therefore, remote psychotherapy provides a valuable option to continue mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study investigated the fear of psychotherapists to become infected with COVID-19 during psychotherapy in personal contact and assessed how the provision of psychotherapy changed due to the COVID-19 situation and whether there were differences with regard to country and gender. Psychotherapists from three European countries: Czech Republic (CZ, <i>n</i> = 112), Germany (DE, <i>n</i> = 130) and Slovakia (SK, <i>n</i> = 96), with on average 77.8% female participants, completed an online survey. Participants rated the fear of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face psychotherapy and reported the number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via internet) during the COVID-19 situation as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. Fear of COVID-19 infection was highest in SK and lowest in DE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was higher in female compared to male psychotherapists (<i>p</i> = 0.021). In all countries, the number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and remote psychotherapies increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with more patients being treated via internet than via telephone during the COVID-19 situation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, female psychotherapists treated less patients in personal contact (<i>p</i> = 0.036), while they treated more patients via telephone than their male colleagues (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Overall, the total number of patients treated did not differ during COVID-19 from the months before (<i>p</i> = 0.133) and psychotherapy in personal contact remained the most common treatment modality. Results imply that the supply of mental health care could be maintained during COVID-19 and that changes in the provision of psychotherapy vary among countries and gender.","Humer, Pieh, Kuska, Barke, Doering, Gossmann, Trnka, Meier, Kascakova, Tavel, Probst","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134811","20200717","COVID-19; fear of infection; psychotherapy; public health; remote psychotherapy; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Czech Republic; Fear; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotherapy; Slovakia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Impact of COVID-19 on gaming disorder: Monitoring and prevention","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has necessitated physical distancing, lockdown, contact tracing, and self-quarantine so as to prevent the spread of the disease. Amid the outbreak, gaming data usage has reportedly increased in the United States, and game download volume has reached a record high in Europe. Because gaming can be used to cope with the psychological stress from the outbreak, therefore mental health professionals should be aware of how increased gaming during the pandemic may contribute to risk of gaming disorder, especially if the pandemic persists. Mental health professionals should thus formulate safe social interaction alternatives for people, particularly adolescents, who have gaming disorder risk.","Ko, Yen","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00040","20200811","COVID-19; adolescents; gaming disorder; physical distancing; psychological impact; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Behavior, Addictive; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Education, Distance; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation; Video Games","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Pediatric Mental and Behavioral Health in the Period of Quarantine and Social Distancing With COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and has had a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Children are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause children to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity, and exhaustion, and even raise the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for children and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the biopsychosocial model, some children may have catastrophic thoughts and be prone to experience despair, numbness, flashbacks, and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or posttraumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health, and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for children. Based on the psychological development characteristics of children, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on children. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on children. Health care delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and child health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term becomes a new reality. Future research on children's mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, and health informatics among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies, and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to children's growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality, and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for children's health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor children's mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligence could be used to support decision making on whether children should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened. Implications to clinical practices, psychological therapeutic practices, and future research directions to address current effort gaps are highlighted in this study.","Ye","https://doi.org/10.2196/19867","20200814","COVID-19; digital interventions; health technology; mental health; pediatrics; social distancing; stay-at-home orders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Risk, resilience, psychological distress, and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The current COVID-19 pandemic comes with multiple psychological stressors due to health-related, social, economic, and individual consequences and may cause psychological distress. The aim of this study was to screen the population in Germany for negative impact on mental health in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. A total of 6,509 people took part in an online survey in Germany from 27 March to 6 April. The questionnaire included demographic information and ascertained psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk and protective factors. In our sample, over 50% expressed suffering from anxiety and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID-19 (MÂ =Â 4.45). Psychological and social determinants showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID-19 than experiences with the disease. The current COVID-19 pandemic does cause psychological distress, anxiety, and depression for large proportions of the general population. Strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, acceptance of anxiety and negative emotions, fostering self-efficacy, and information on where to get medical treatment if needed, seem of help, while substance abuse and suppression of anxiety and negative emotions seem to be associated with more psychological burden.","Petzold, Bendau, Plag, Pyrkosch, Mascarell Maricic, Betzler, Rogoll, GroÃŸe, StrÃ¶hle","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1745","20200717","adjustment disorders; anxiety/anxiety disorders; coping; corona; depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A nation-wide survey on emotional and psychological impacts of COVID-19 social distancing","Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, Ciancimino, Crescimbene, La Longa, Parsi, Tintori, Palomba","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202006_21711","20200710","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Female; Humans; Internet; Italy; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Behavior; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: An emotional health perspective of Indians on Twitter","Novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) has spread in the world since its first human infection in December 2019. India has also witnessed a rising number of infections since March 2020. The Indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus. Tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind. Through this article, an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of Indian people using Python and R statistical software, during the recent lockdown 2.0 (15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020) and lockdown 3.0 (4 May 2020 to 17 May 2020) through their tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Also, opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed. Analysis has been performed using Python and R statistical software. Also, recent articles related to COVID-19 have been considered and reviewed. Although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness, disgust and others, the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0. This analysis can help the health specialists to understand people's mind-set, the authorities to take further corresponding measures in washing out the virus and the e-commerce stakeholders to adapt to the changing attitudes by adjusting demand and supply plans accordingly.","Chehal, Gupta, Gulati","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940741","20200710","COVID-19; Twitter; e-commerce; human behaviour; lockdown; opinion mining","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Maintaining High-Quality Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship Programs: Part I: Innovations in Pain Fellows' Education, Research, Applicant Selection Process, Wellness, and ACGME Implementation During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Pain fellowship programs are facing unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions from state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for todays' fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to guarantee that proper education is maintained and to ensure the well-being of our trainees. We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors to provide guidance and formulate recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationally. This guidance is based on reviewing current changes to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board of Anesthesiology policies and best available evidence and expert opinion on the use of remote educational activities, research endeavors, and trainee wellness. The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been severe and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Understanding revisions to ACGME policies, using technology to promote remote learning opportunities, and providing trainees with opportunities to alleviate their anxiety and encourage mental health are beneficial strategies to implement. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to help overcome these challenges.","Kohan, Moeschler, Spektor, Przkora, Sobey, Brancolini, Wahezi, Anitescu","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa168","20200827","Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Telehealth; COVID-19; Competency; Fellowship Program; Pain Management; Pandemic; Wellness; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Education, Medical, Graduate; Fellowships and Scholarships; Humans; Pain Management; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation","With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have been forced to follow strict social isolation guidelines. While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt.Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.","Dhont, Di Tella, Dubois, Aznar, Petit, SpaÅ‚ek, Boldrini, Franco, Bertholet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006","20200828","COVID-19; HADS; Isolation; Mental health; Research","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public mental health. Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the I<sup>2</sup> index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6). COVID-19 not only causes physical health concerns but also results in a number of psychological disorders. The spread of the new coronavirus can impact the mental health of people in different communities. Thus, it is essential to preserve the mental health of individuals and to develop psychological interventions that can improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Salari, Hosseinian-Far, Jalali, Vaisi-Raygani, Rasoulpoor, Mohammadi, Rasoulpoor, Khaledi-Paveh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00589-w","20200709","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; General population; Meta-analysis; Prevalence; Stress; Systematic review; Anxiety; Asia; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Europe; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Augmenting Evidence-Based Care With a Texting Mobile Interventionist: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and clinical utility of training intensive psychiatric community care team members to serve as &quot;mobile interventionists&quot; who engage patients in recovery-oriented texting exchanges. A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the mobile interventionist approach as an add-on to assertive community treatment (ACT) versus ACT alone. Participants were 49 individuals with serious mental illness (62% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 24% with bipolar disorder, and 14% with depression). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up, and satisfaction was evaluated posttreatment. The intervention appeared feasible (95% of participants assigned to the mobile interventionist arm initiated the intervention, texting on 69% of possible days and averaging four messages per day), acceptable (91% reported satisfaction), and safe (no adverse events reported). Exploratory posttreatment clinical effect estimations suggested greater reductions in the severity of paranoid thoughts (Cohen's d=-0.61) and depression (d=-0.59) and improved illness management (d=0.31) and recovery (d=0.23) in the mobile interventionist group. Augmentation of care with a texting mobile interventionist proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising. The findings are encouraging given the relative ease of training practitioners to serve as mobile interventionists, the low burden placed on patients and practitioners, and the simplicity of the technology. The technical resources are widely accessible to patients and practitioners, boding well for potential intervention scalability.

Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet.","Gualano, Lo Moro, Voglino, Bert, Siliquini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134779","20200717","anxiety; depression; patient health questionnaire; quarantine; sleep wake disorders; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How to Defend COVID-19 in Taiwan? Talk about People's Disease Awareness, Attitudes, Behaviors and the Impact of Physical and Mental Health","This study explored awareness, attitudes, and behavior in relation to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention among Taiwanese citizens and their physical and mental health statuses. Through collection of 2132 questionnaire responses in field research, the present researchers analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and various approaches. In conclusion, the public's high level of willingness to share information, sufficient knowledge of and consensus on epidemic prevention between individuals and families, strict compliance with relevant regulations, effective preventive measures, and adequate public facilities have contributed to control of COVID-19. However, vigilance and awareness of the pandemic in some individuals, epidemic-prevention campaigns, and community-based preventive measures were insufficient. Some citizens subsequently suffered from headaches, anxiety, and mood instability. Furthermore, demographic variables (place of residence, sex, age, and occupation) and physical and mental health status produced various effects on citizens' awareness, attitude, and behavior regarding epidemic prevention as well as the perceived effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health.","Hsu, Lin, Wang, Jhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134694","20200728","Coronavirus Disease 2019; Taiwan; prevention measures; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Strategies to Increase Peer Support Specialists' Capacity to Use Digital Technology in the Era of COVID-19: Pre-Post Study","Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), telemental health to support mental health services was primarily designed for individuals with professional clinical degrees, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, registered nurses, and licensed clinical social workers. For the first the time in history, peer support specialists are offering Medicaid-reimbursable telemental health services during the COVID-19 crisis; however, little effort has been made to train peer support specialists on telehealth practice and delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use digital peer support technology. The Digital Peer Support Certification was co-produced with peer support specialists and included an education and simulation training session, synchronous and asynchronous support services, and audit and feedback. Participants included 9 certified peer support specialists between the ages of 25 and 54 years (mean 39 years) who were employed as peer support specialists for 1 to 11 years (mean 4.25 years) and had access to a work-funded smartphone device and data plan. A pre-post design was implemented to examine the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use technology over a 3-month timeframe. Data were collected at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Overall, an upward trend in peer support specialists' capacity to offer digital peer support occurred during the 3-month certification period. The Digital Peer Support Certification shows promising evidence of increasing the capacity of peer support specialists to use specific digital peer support technology features. Our findings also highlighted that this capacity was less likely to increase with training alone and that a combinational knowledge translation approach that includes both training and management will be more successful.","Fortuna, Myers, Walsh, Walker, Mois, Brooks","https://doi.org/10.2196/20429","20200807","COVID-19; mental health; peer support; telemental health; training","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID stress syndrome: Concept, structure, and correlates","Research shows that the COVID Stress Scales have a robust multifactorial structure, representing five correlated facets of COVID-19-related distress: (a) Fear of the dangerousness of COVID-19, which includes fear of coming into contact with fomites potentially contaminated with SARSCoV2, (b) worry about socioeconomic costs of COVID-19 (e.g., worry about personal finances and disruption in the supply chain), (c) xenophobic fears that foreigners are spreading SARSCoV2, (d) traumatic stress symptoms associated with direct or vicarious traumatic exposure to COVID-19 (nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or images related to COVID-19), and (e) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. A population-representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self-report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID-19-related experiences, distress, and coping. Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID-19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi-dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID-19-related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self-isolation. The findings provide new information about the structure and correlates of COVID stress syndrome. Further research is needed to determine whether the syndrome will abate once the pandemic has passed or whether, for some individuals, it becomes a chronic condition.","Taylor, Landry, Paluszek, Fergus, McKay, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23071","20200819","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; fear; pandemic; stress; xenophobia; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Fear; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Symptoms During the Two Stages of Lockdown in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Investigation in a Sample of Citizens in Northern Spain","Spain has been in a state of emergency since 14th March due to the COVID-19 crisis. This state of emergency means that the population must comply with strict rules such as lockdown (confinement to their homes except for essential trips) and social distancing. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological state of the general population in a sample recruited in Northern Spain. Sociodemographic and psychological data were gathered, assessing variables such as stress, anxiety, and depression. A questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the lockdown and three weeks later. The sample was recruited using an online questionnaire by means of a non-probabilistic snowball sampling methodology. A total of 1,933 people participated in this study. The results reveal that more than a quarter of the participants have reported symptoms of depression (27.5%), anxiety (26.9%) and stress (26.5%) and as the time spent in lockdown has progressed, psychological symptoms have risen. In relation to gender, data indicate that men have higher levels of depression than women, and similar levels of anxiety and stress. Greater symptomatology has also been found among the younger population and in people with chronic diseases. We discuss the need to continue carrying out these types of studies to prevent and treat psychological problems that could emerge amidst this pandemic.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Idoiaga Mondragon, Dosil SantamarÃ­a, Picaza Gorrotxategi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01491","20200707","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in Guangdong, China: a cross-sectional study","During previous pandemic outbreaks, medical staff have reported high levels of psychological distress. The aim of the current study was to report a snapshot of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its correlated factors on medical staff in Guangdong, China. On the 2nd and 3rd February 2020, soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed medical staff at four hospitals in Guangdong, China, to collect demographic characteristics, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. Complete responses were received from 1045 medical staff. Respondents were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to their working environment of contacting with potential or confirmed COVID-19 cases. The proportion of staff with anxiety (55.4% v. 43.0%, p &lt; 0.001) or depression (43.6% v. 36.8%, p = 0.028) was significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group. The percentage of staff with severe anxiety was similar in the two groups. Doctors were more susceptible to moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. The high-risk group had higher levels of clinical insomnia (13.5% v. 8.5%, p = 0.011) and were more likely to be in the upper quartile for stress symptoms (24.7% v. 19.3%, p = 0.037) than the low-risk group. Additionally, work experience negatively correlated with insomnia symptoms. It is important for hospitals and authorities to protect both the physical and psychological health of medical staff during times of pandemic, even those with a low exposure risk.","Wang, Huang, Huang, Zhang, Guo, Liu, Ma, Geng","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720002561","20200723","Anxiety; COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019; medical staff; psychological status","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Cancer, immune suppression and Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Need to manage drug safety (French Society for Oncology Pharmacy [SFPO] guidelines)","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is disrupting our health environment. As expected, studies highlighted the great susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19 and more severe complications, leading oncologists to deeply rethink patient cancer care. This review is dedicated to the optimization of care pathways and therapeutics in cancer patients during the pandemic and aims to discuss successive issues. First we focused on the international guidelines proposing adjustments and alternative options to cancer care in order to limit hospital admission and cytopenic treatment in cancer patients, most of whom are immunocompromised. In addition cancer patients are prone to polypharmacy, enhancing the risk of drug-related problems as adverse events and drug-drug interactions. Due to increased risk in case of COVID-19, we reported a comprehensive review of all the drug-related problems between COVID-19 and antineoplastics. Moreover, in the absence of approved drug against COVID-19, infected patients may be included in clinical trials evaluating new drugs with a lack of knowledge, particularly in cancer patients. Focusing on the several experimental drugs currently being evaluated, we set up an original data board helping oncologists and pharmacists to identify promptly drug-related problems between antineoplastics and experimental drugs. Finally additional and concrete recommendations are provided, supporting oncologists and pharmacists in their efforts to manage cancer patients and to optimize their treatments in this new era related to COVID-19.","Slimano, Baudouin, Zerbit, Toulemonde-Deldicque, Thomas-Schoemann, Chevrier, Daouphars, Madelaine, Pourroy, Tournamille, Astier, Ranchon, Cazin, Bardin, Rioufol","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102063","20200729","COVID-19; Clinical trials; Drug safety; Drug-drug interactions; Drug-related problems; Herb-Drug interactions; Immune depression; Antineoplastic Agents; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Trials as Topic; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Pandemics; Pharmacy; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The response of the mental health network of the Salamanca area to the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of the telemedicine","The COVID-19 pandemic reached world-wide causing a great impact on healthcare services. The aim of this work is to describe the response of the Mental Health Network of the SalamancaÂ´ Area (Spain) to this crisis and the reorganization of its resources within the first 8 weeks after the state of alarm was declared. The Psychiatry Service applied a contingency plan which included the reorganization of the human resources, the closure of some of the units and the implementation of telemedicine programs along with two specific programs, namely a mental health assistance program in the context of the infection by coronavirus, and another program for homeless people. 9.038 phone interviews were carried out in the outpatients and community mental health programs. The activity in subacute and acute wards, as well as that of the day hospital programs was decreased to 50%. Based on that this real-world response provided we concluded that the usage of telemedicine is promising in patients with any kind of disorder. Its implementation in daily practice will be considered in the future.

"Considerations for people with diabetes during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic","The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to cause havoc globally, resulting in unprecedented healthcare, societal and economic disruption. People with diabetes have been shown to be at higher risk of complications and death when exposed to pneumonia, influenza and other coronaviruses. Despite pandemic scale infection, there is currently limited understanding on the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on people with diabetes. (1) To characterise the outcomes of COVID-19 for people with diabetes and (2) add value to current recommendations for healthcare providers and people with diabetes to encourage optimal management. A search of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE to March 2020 was undertaken, using search terms pertaining to diabetes, coronavirus and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We briefly reviewed the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of diabetes. People with diabetes are at greater risk of severe infection and death with COVID-19. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the daily lives of individuals living with diabetes through financial implications, food and medication scarcity and its burden on mental health. In Australia, delivery of medical care has been adapted to reduce the risk of transmission, with a particular emphasis on telehealth and remote monitoring.","Sacks, Pham, Fleming, Neoh, Ekinci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108296","20200828","Coronavirus; Diabetes","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on a sample of Spanish health professionals","After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil SantamarÃ­a, Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Redondo RodrÃ­guez, Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Picaza Gorrotxategi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004","20200707","Ansiedad; Anxiety; COVID-19; DepresiÃ³n; Depression; Health proffesionals; Insomnia; Insomnio; Personal sanitario","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents' individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.","Guessoum, Lachal, Radjack, Carretier, Minassian, Benoit, Moro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264","20200902","Adolescent; Covid-19; Depression; Mental disorder; Pandemic; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Witness to Witness Program: Helping the Helpers in the Context of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Witness to Witness Program (W2W), based on Weingarten's witnessing model (2000, 2003, 2004), began in July 2018 and originally was established to support healthcare workers and attorneys (our partners) who were experiencing empathic distress working with people involved in various stages of the detention process. The W2W program evolved to offer four primary components: clinician listening sessions geared to deep understanding of the person's story of their work and its challenges; an inventory of the person's current internal and external resources both in the present and in the past; help with removal of barriers to those resources; and development of a personal toolkit to handle stress. Additional services available to partners and their organizations included psycho-educational webinars, facilitated peer support groups, and organizational consultations to foster trauma-sensitive and resilience-hardy work environments. In March, after lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, W2W pivoted to focus on handouts and webinars addressing how to cope with distress and moral injury, maintaining resilience, coping with grief, and dealing with multiple losses caused by the pandemic. Disaster sparked collaboration and innovation. A train the trainer model was developed to reach more community health workers providing services to the Latinx community dealing with losses similar to those experienced by the clients they serve. W2W continues to create virtual communities of support. In doing so we practice doing reasonable hope together (Weingarten, Family Process, 2010, 49, 5). El â€œPrograma de testigo a testigoâ€ (Witness to Witness Program, W2W), basado en el modelo de testigos de Weingarten (2000, 2003, 2004), comenzÃ³ en julio de 2018 y se creÃ³ originalmente para apoyar a los trabajadores sanitarios y a los abogados (nuestros socios) que estaban sufriendo distrÃ©s empÃ¡tico al trabajar con personas implicadas en varias etapas del proceso de detenciÃ³n. El programa W2W evolucionÃ³ y ahora ofrece cuatro componentes principales: sesiones de escucha con el clÃ­nico orientadas a una comprensiÃ³n profunda de la historia del trabajo de la persona y sus dificultades; un inventario de los recursos externos e internos actuales de la persona tanto en el presente como en el pasado; ayuda con la eliminaciÃ³n de obstÃ¡culos para acceder a esos recursos; y desarrollo de un conjunto de herramientas personales para manejar el estrÃ©s. Otros servicios disponibles para los socios y sus organizaciones fueron seminarios web psicoeducativos, grupos de autoayuda con facilitadores y consultas organizacionales para fomentar entornos de trabajo donde se priorice la sensibilidad al trauma y la resiliencia. En marzo, despuÃ©s de los confinamientos por la pandemia del coronavirus, el W2W dio un giro para centrarse en folletos y seminarios web que abordan cÃ³mo afrontar el distrÃ©s y el daÃ±o moral, mantener la resiliencia, afrontar el duelo y soportar numerosas pÃ©rdidas causadas por la pandemia. La catÃ¡strofe generÃ³ colaboraciÃ³n e innovaciÃ³n.

"[Problems of mental health in the situation of COVID-19 pandemic]","The WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic, the deterioration of the epidemic situation in Russia, the lockdown and the growing fear in society caused by panic rumors and misinformation spread on social networks and the media pose urgent organizational and medical tasks for our psychiatric service. Based on the experience of other countries that have already encountered the massive spread of COVID-19, the author presents a review of the proposed urgent and preventive organizational and treatment measures and suggests practical recommendations on urgent temporary reorganization of the psychiatric service, and the provision of psychological and psychotherapeutic support to the most vulnerable groups of the population, including medical personnel working with patients with COVID-19, and the management of mentally ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. As the primary goals, it is proposed to separate the flows of people in need of psychological support and psychiatric care, and organize the remote provision of these services (hotline phones and telemedicine consultations). Particular attention is paid to the management of mentally ill patients with coronavirus respiratory syndrome and the characteristics of psychopharmacological therapy with an overview of the potential risks of side-effects and complications related primarily to respiratory function, including those due to adverse drug interactions.

"Infidelity in the Time of COVID-19","Infidelity occurs in approximately 25% of marriages and is associated with various negative consequences for individuals (e.g., depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress), the couple relationship (e.g., financial loss, increased conflict, and aggression), and the couple's children (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Infidelity is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for divorce. The increased stress brought on by the pandemic may be putting couples at an increased risk for experiencing infidelity, and data collected during the pandemic have shown that people across the United States are engaging in behaviors that are associated with a high likelihood of experiencing infidelity. The negative consequences of infidelity are also likely to be exacerbated for couples during the pandemic due to the intersection with the social, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID-19. Furthermore, couples are likely to experience disruptions and delays to the affair recovery process during the pandemic, which can negatively impact their ability to heal. Therefore, recommendations for navigating affair recovery during the pandemic, including adaptations for therapy, are also discussed. La infidelidad se da en aproximadamente el 25Â % de los matrimonios y estÃ¡ asociada con varias consecuencias negativas en las personas (p. ej.: depresiÃ³n, ansiedad, estrÃ©s postraumÃ¡tico), la relaciÃ³n de pareja (p. ej.: pÃ©rdida econÃ³mica, aumento de conflictos y agresiones) y los hijos de la pareja (p. ej.: comportamientos de internalizaciÃ³n y de externalizaciÃ³n). La infidelidad tambiÃ©n es uno de los motivos de divorcio mÃ¡s frecuentes. El aumento del estrÃ©s que genera la pandemia puede aumentar el riesgo de las parejas de ser infieles, y los datos recogidos durante la pandemia han demostrado que las personas de los Estados Unidos estÃ¡n teniendo conductas asociadas con una alta probabilidad de ser infieles. AdemÃ¡s, durante la pandemia, las consecuencias negativas de la infidelidad tienden a exacerbarse en las parejas debido a la combinaciÃ³n con las consecuencias sociales, emocionales y econÃ³micas de la COVID-19. Asimismo, el proceso de recuperaciÃ³n de la aventura amorosa tiende a interrumpirse y retrasarse durante la pandemia, lo cual puede influir negativamente en la capacidad de sanar de las parejas. Por lo tanto, tambiÃ©n se dan recomendaciones para orientarse en el proceso de recuperaciÃ³n de la aventura amorosa durante la pandemia, por ejemplo, adaptaciones relacionadas con la terapia. åœ¨å¤§çº¦25%çš„å©šå§»ä¸­ï¼Œä¼šå‡ºçŽ°å©šå†…ä¸å¿ çš„è¡Œä¸ºï¼Œè¿™å¯¹ä¸ªäººè€Œè¨€å¸¦æ¥å„ç§è´Ÿé¢åŽæžœ(ä¾‹å¦‚ï¼ŒæŠ‘éƒã€ç„¦è™‘ã€åˆ›ä¼¤åŽåŽ‹åŠ›)ï¼Œå’Œä¹Ÿå¯¹å…¶ä»–æ–¹é¢å¸¦æ¥ä¸å¥½çš„ç»“æžœï¼Œå¦‚å¤«å¦»å…³ç³»(ä¾‹å¦‚ï¼Œç»æµŽæŸå¤±ã€å†²çªé¢‘ç¹å’Œæ”»å‡»æ€§å¢žåŠ )ä»¥åŠè¯¥å¤«å¦»å…±åŒçš„å­©å­(ä¾‹å¦‚ï¼Œå†…åŒ–è¡Œä¸ºå’Œå¤–åŒ–è¡Œä¸º)ã€‚å©šå†…ä¸å¿ ä¹Ÿæ˜¯ç¦»å©šæœ€å¸¸è§çš„åŽŸå› ä¹‹ä¸€ã€‚æ–°å† ç—…æ¯’ç–«æƒ…å¸¦æ¥çš„åŽ‹åŠ›å¢žåŠ äº†å¤«å¦»å©šå†…èƒŒå›çš„é£Žé™©ã€‚åœ¨ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´æ”¶é›†çš„æ•°æ®æ˜¾ç¤ºï¼Œç¾Žå›½å„åœ°çš„äººä»¬éƒ½æœ‰ç€æ›´é«˜çš„å¯èƒ½æ€§å‘ç”Ÿä¸å¿ æœ‰å…³çš„è¡Œä¸ºã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ï¼Œç”±äºŽCOVID-19å¸¦æ¥çš„ç¤¾ä¼šã€æƒ…æ„Ÿå’Œç»æµŽæ–¹é¢çš„åŽæžœçš„äº¤å‰åœ¨ä¸€èµ·ï¼Œå©šå†…ä¸å¿ é€ æˆçš„è´Ÿé¢åŽæžœä¹Ÿå¯èƒ½å¯¹å¤«å¦»äº§ç”Ÿæ¯”ä»¥å¾€æ›´ä¸¥é‡çš„å½±å“ã€‚æ­¤å¤–ï¼Œç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´ï¼Œå¤«å¦»å¯èƒ½ä¼šç»åŽ†å©šå¤–æƒ…å…³ç³»æ¢å¤è¿‡ç¨‹çš„æ— æ³•å»¶ç»­å’Œå»¶è¿Ÿï¼Œè¿™å¯èƒ½å¯¹ä»–ä»¬çš„æ„ˆåˆèƒ½åŠ›äº§ç”Ÿè´Ÿé¢å½±å“ã€‚å› æ­¤ï¼Œç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å¯¹å©šå¤–æƒ…åŽçš„æŒ‡å¯¼æ€§æ¢å¤å»ºè®®ï¼ŒåŒ…æ‹¬æ²»ç–—çš„é€‚åº”æ€§æ”¹å˜ä¹Ÿéƒ½å¾—åˆ°è®¨è®ºã€‚.","Coop Gordon, Mitchell","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12576","20200820","Affair Recovery; Clinical Recommendations; Couples; Infidelity; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Covid-19 pandemic seen from the frontline","COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces respiratory symptoms, predominantly of the upper airways, which can progress to pneumonia after 7 days with persistent fever, cough and dyspnea, and even develop a syndrome of acute respiratory distress (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death. Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU). In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department; as well as explaining home isolation measures. In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment; In case of oxygen saturation &lt;95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU. Depending on the severity of the patient, he/she would be or not a candidate for invasive mechanical ventilation, which must be performed by trained personnel to prevent the spread of the infection minimizing the risk of contagion. ARDS's treatment strategies include pulmonary protection ventilation, prone position, recruitment maneuvers and, less frequently, oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane. Among the specific treatments for COVID-19 stand out mainly drugs to reduce viral load, although sometimes specific drugs will be needed to treat hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability and concomitant infections. One of the goals to be achieved is for patients to recover and be able to successfully return to work; for this purpose, an adequate physical and psychological rehabilitation program is essential, as about 50% have symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Carmona, Nielfa, Alvarado","https://doi.org/10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2020.S123","20200807"," Emergencies; Primary Health Care; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 [Supplementary Concept] ; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emergencies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Primary Health Care; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Emerging public health challenge in UK: perception and belief on increased COVID19 death among BAME healthcare workers","Coronavirus infection Disease 19 impacted every part of the world and routine life. Recent report from the Office of national statistics in UK reported disproportionate death among Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) population. NHS is heavily relied on the BAME work force both in front line and in the community. We attempted to explore the beliefs and perception about reported worrying issue among BAME health work force in a Diverse city of Leicester. This is a cross-sectional survey using 20 questions in an electronic format. The target population was identified through Leicester Asian Doctors Society and Leicester Asian Nurses Society. The questionnaire was then distributed electronically to the members. Survey questionnaire was accessed by 372, incomplete response (172) were excluded and 200 completed responses were analysed. Majority of BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line duties. More than 70% were anxious about their role during this pandemic. The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply was adequate, and the support received from the local healthcare providers was more than satisfactory. The work force perceived co-morbidity, lack of PPE and testing were one of the few reasons for increased death in BAME. BAME group felt adequate provision of PPE, increased testing and improving mental health well-being is required to alleviate concerns and improve BAME working life in NHS. BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line work and current anxiety level is very high.

Front-line professionals exposed and involved in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 patients are more susceptible. Method This review was conducted based on papers that were published at MEDLINE, BMJ, PsycINFO, and LILACS, the according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA). Results Health professionals had a higher level of anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p < 0.01, OR = 1.6152; 95%CI 1.3283 to 1.9641; p < 0.0001) and depression 12.2 vs. 9.5%; p = 0.04; OR = 1.3246; 95%CI 1.0930 to 1.6053; p = 0.0042), besides somatizations and insomnia compared to professionals from other areas.

"Psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Background Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16 h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. Method We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. Results Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. Conclusion There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities. The incidence of obsessive-compulsive traces and somatizations was higher in situations involving front-line professionals.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110057","20210110",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Viral, host and environmental factors that favor anthropozoonotic spillover of coronaviruses: An opinionated review, focusing on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","Environmental factors play a key role in the zoonotic transmission of emerging pathogenic viruses as mankind is constantly disturbing wildlife's ecosystems usually by cutting down forests to build human settlements or by catching wild animals for food, which deprives the viruses of their natural hosts and gives them opportunity to infect humans. In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002–2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483","20210101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis?","COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first ‘Green Deal’ initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19. Candidate areas for future consideration will focus on climate action, digitization, manufacturing, and sustainable food production, security, and waste mitigation.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review","Background As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (=40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Limitations A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies.

"COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India","COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102254","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines","Background : The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies’ mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. Methods : A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. Results : The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors’ abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Limitations : An English online survey was used. Conclusion : During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health &amp; wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study","Background COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B=3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B= 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B=3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B=7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms.

"Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis","Background Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. Methods Online cross-sectional data (n = 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study (n = 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). Results Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. Conclusions Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress.

"Psychological distress related to COVID-19 – The contribution of continuous traumatic stress","Objective The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Method An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. Results Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. Limitations This study relied on convenience sampling. Conclusions Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Optimism-pessimism, conspiracy theories and general trust as factors contributing to COVID-19 related behavior – A cross-cultural study","The main aim of this research was to examine the role of optimism-pessimism, general trust and belief in conspiracy theories, in COVID-19 related fears, preventive and hoarding behaviors. We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear.

"Standing up for health – improving mental wellbeing during COVID-19 isolation by reducing sedentary behaviour","The global COVID-19 outbreak and its management are disrupting ways of life and increasing the risk of poor mental and physical health for many. The restrictions on movement have made some forms of physical activity harder to achieve and increased the chances of more sedentary behaviour. Independent of exercise taken, sedentary behaviour can have a negative impact upon mental health, especially by lowering mood. We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home. These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others.

"Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers'(HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Method: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. Results: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). Limitations: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Conclusion: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological status of 8817 hospital workers during COVID-19 Epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Chongqing","Background There was an outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2019 in China, which spread all over the world rapidly. The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. Method An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. Results 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers (P<0.05). Limitations This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. Conclusion There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected.

"The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients","While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives. The majority of coronavirus disease deaths are due to pneumonia. Mostly, stress and depression are associated with coronavirus disease infection and thus, resulting in weakening of patients’ immune response and hence, more severe respiratory symptoms or even death. We propose using a class of antidepressants named selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for their reported potential antiviral effect, modulatory effect of respiratory symptoms, antioxidant properties and immunoregulatory effects beside their main action as antidepressant. In addition, the low cost of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might add a benefit for coronavirus disease patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"An analysis on the panic during COVID-19 pandemic through an online form","With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p = 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p = 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness.

"Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and their correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. Results The overall prevalence of depression in 1103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68–46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and current smokers (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower QOL compared to those without (F (1,1103)=423.83, P<0.001). Conclusion Depression was common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses’ QOL, a heightened awareness of, and early treatment for depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan","Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. Results: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (ß = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (ß = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (ß = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression.

"Changes in alcohol use as a function of psychological distress and social support following COVID-19 related University closings","Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30 days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

To determine the effect of these restrictions on suicidal ideation, a total of 3,120 individuals completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at one of three time points from April through June 2020. The percentage of respondents endorsing suicidal ideation was greater with each passing month for those under lockdown or shelter-in-place restrictions due to the novel coronavirus, but remained relatively stable and unchanged for those who reported no such restrictions.

"Maternal psychological distress &amp; mental health service use during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0–8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0–18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms.

"An Acute Manic Episode During 2019-nCoV Quarantine","Background The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. Case presentation A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Conclusion Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Emotional “inflection point” in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China","Background The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. Methods This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. Results In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. Conclusion This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2.

"COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs and their relationship with perceived stress and pre-existing conspiracy beliefs","Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID–related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110201","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

In a nationwide online sample of 435 U.S. adults, conducted in March 2020 as the pandemic accelerated and states implemented stay-at-home orders, we examined whether stay-at-home orders and individuals’ personal distancing behavior were associated with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), intrusive thoughts, insomnia, and acute stress. Stay-at-home order status and personal distancing were independently associated with higher symptoms, beyond protective effects of available social resources (social support and social network size). A subsample of 118 participants who had completed symptom measures earlier in the outbreak (February 2020) showed increases in depression and GAD between February and March, and personal distancing behavior was associated with these increases.

However, the temporal change of mental health status due to pandemic-related stress in relation to protective and risk factors to hostility is less known. This study was implemented at two timepoints, i.e., during the peak and the remission of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3233 Chinese individuals participated in the first wave, and among them 1390 participants were followed in a second wave. The result showed that fear significantly decreased over time, while depression level significantly increased during the second wave compared to the first wave of the survey. Younger age, lower-income, increased level of perceived stress, and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of depression escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a higher initial stress response tended to show more hostility. Furthermore, the use of negative coping strategy plays a potential intermediating role in the stress-related increase in hostility, while social support acts as a buffer in hostility in the general population under high stress.

"Distance education as a response to pandemics: Coronavirus and Arab culture","Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox ‘distanceship’.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101317","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Objective While it is well known that mental health problems are common consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCLC), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. Results It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. Conclusion These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131","20201015",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"University students’ changes in mental health status and determinants of behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","Introduction : The aim of the study was to investigate mental health in university students in Greece, during lockdown due to COVID-19. Material and Methods : The data were collected online and anonymously, during lockdown; they included 1104 females (aged 22.08±4,96) and 431 males (aged 22.35±3.11). The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios Results : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2–5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20–68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. Discussion : The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs.

"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study","Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. Methods This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Results Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57–2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46–2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99–1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63–2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92–1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53–1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54–3.52) for mental problems. Limitations The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Conclusions Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients.

"Psychological impact of coronavirus disease (2019) (COVID-19) epidemic on medical staff in different posts in China: A multicenter study","Objective An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a big challenge to medical staff and general public. The aim is to investigate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on medical staff in different working posts in China, and to explore the correlation between psychological disorder and the exposure to COVID-19. Methods A multicenter WeChat-based online survey was conducted among medical staff in China between 26 February and 3 March 2020. Medical staff deployed to Hubei province from other provinces and medical staffs in different posts outside Hubei were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of COVID-19. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, stress and resilience were evaluated using scales including GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, PSS-14, and CD-RISC-10. Latent class analysis was performed to identify potential staff requiring psychological support. Results A total of 274 respondents were included, who serving at 4 posts as follows, staff backing Hubei province, isolation wards outside Hubei, fever clinic and infectious disease department, and other departments outside Hubei. The total scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and stress were statistically different among groups, meanwhile an increasing tendency of anxiety, depression and sleep quality scores with increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19 was found (p < 0.05). Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated that the staff backing Hubei had higher scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and perceived stress (adjusted p < 0.05). The combined prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia of staff backing Hubei reached as high as 38%. Four-class latent class analysis showed 3 categories of population (69.4%) may need psychological support. Conclusions High prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia exist in medical staff related to COVID-19. The higher the probability and intensity of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the greater the risk that medical staff will suffer from mental disorders, suggesting continuous and proper psychiatric intervention are needed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.008","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Risk factors associated with mental illness in hospital discharged patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11–22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life in clinically stable patients with COVID-19","Introduction High risk of mental health problems is associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. Methods This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. Results A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, P = 0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, P = 0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. Conclusion Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19.

"Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic","Objective To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of insomnia symptoms among Chinese adolescents and young adults affected by the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12–29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. Results Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. Conclusions Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students’ projections of trends in COVID-19. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a risk factor for insomnia symptoms; as such, the government must devote more attention to sleep disorders in this patient population while combating COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological status of healthcare workers during the civil war and COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Objective Healthcare workers, particularly those working in departments that provide care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are at a higher risk of this contagious disease than those who work in other departments. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, which has compounded Libya's existing civil war-related problems. Methods A multi-center cross-sectional survey on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse was conducted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers. Results The data of 745 eligible healthcare workers from 15 hospitals were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared to the basic characteristics of the participants to determine the association. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants had depressive symptoms, while 348 (46.7%) had anxiety symptoms. Age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms.

"An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in china during the outbreak of COVID-19","Objective : The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . Methods : By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. Results : The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099–1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209–2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252–7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609–0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923–0.951). Conclusion : Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents.

"Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in response to COVID-19: A study of the general population in China at the peak of its epidemic","Rationale Psychological resilience is characterized as the ability to respond to extreme stress or trauma or adverse experience successfully. While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. Objective This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. Method Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. Results The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized ß = -0.490, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized ß = -0.443, P < 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized ß = -0.358, P < 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized ß = -0.256, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.217, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized ß = -0.268, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.147, P < 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized ß = -0.236, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.126, P < 0.01). Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience.

"Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. Method To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Results Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms. Limitations Cross-sectional nature and use of sample of convenience.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. Methods During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). Conclusion Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact.

"Psychological effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on healthcare workers globally: A systematic review","In this systematic review, we compared the incidences of psychological issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, occupational stress, PTSD and insomnia, in healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar and PsycInfo were systematically searched for related published articles. In all electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented, and these key words were used: “COVID 19"" OR “SARS-CoV-2"" AND “psychological” OR “stress” OR “depression” AND “healthcare$”. We identified 6 studies, out of the final 15 selected, which reported numerical estimates for incidences of psychological effects. Meta-analysis was conducted, comparing both combined and individual effect sizes of all psychological manifestations. Qualitative evidence was reported from the remaining 9 cross- sectional studies. The summary effects of the combined quantitative meta-analysis conducted on 6 studies did indicate near significant differences between HCW and NHCW. Summary effects of individual manifestations indicated significantly higher incidence of insomnia among HCW, when compared to NHCW. Qualitative evidence from remaining cross-sectional studies provided additional information into the nature of the psychological issues. We conclude that even though reasons for psychological distress among HCW and NHCW may be different, both suffered in equal measures excepting for insomnia.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113360","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health amongst obstetrics and gynaecology doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of a UK-wide study","Objective To explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Study design A cross-section survey-based study amongst doctors working within Obstetrics and Gynaecology in the United Kingdom. Results A total of 207 doctors completed the survey. Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Conclusions Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors.

"Anxiety and hopelessness levels in COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative study of healthcare professionals and other community sample in Turkey","COVID-19 affected our mental health as well as our physical health. In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic. An important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by ensuring that psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups are planned in advance.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults without a pre-existing mental health condition: Findings from American trend panel survey","Most individuals in the United States have no history of a mental health condition yet are at risk for psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19–24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances.

"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. Methods 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Results The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p<0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p<0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom.

Methods : A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001).

Objectives: We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Material and Methods We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Results Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Conclusion Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period.

The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Methods Using an online platform, a national sample (n = 10, 368) of U.S. adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020. The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U.S. population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography. Results Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country; rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found. Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities. Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts. Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology; prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States.

"Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of infertile couples","Objective(s) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertile couples’ emotions, anxiety and future plans. Study design An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. Results 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4 ± 16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8 ± 15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI > 36 of 71 %. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3 ± 15.3. Women were more emotionally distressed, anxious and depressed than men (36.8 ± 16.4 vs 31.0 ± 18.4 for IES-R, respectively; p = 0.03). Notwithstanding the uncertainty about pregnancy safety, 64.6 % of respondents chose to maintain their reproductive programme. Economic crisis induced 11.5 % of the surveyed patients to give up their ART program. Respondents who had at least one relative affected by COVID-19 had a significantly higher IES-R score and anxiety VAS, but not higher STAI scores, than patients belonging to unaffected families.

An online cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th April to 9th May 2020 among 384 parents having at least one child aged between 5–15 years using non-probability sampling. K-means clustering used to group children according to mental health score and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) performed to identify the relationship among the parental behavior and child mental health, and also these associations were assessed through chi-square test. Children were classified into four groups where 43% of child had subthreshold mental disturbances (mean Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-10; 2.8), 30.5% had mild (mean MDD-10; 8.9), 19.3% suffered moderately (mean MDD-10; 15.9), and 7.2% of child suffered from severe disturbances (mean MDD-10; 25.2).

Methods During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response.

"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target","Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I h) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I h amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I h activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173237","20200905",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents’ individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","Objective To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. Design and Measurements During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Results Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Conclusion Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future.

"The psychological and mental impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical staff and general public – A systematic review and meta-analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures.

"The effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity on mental health during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in Austria","Background The impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported for different countries. This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. Methods An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). Results In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off =10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off =10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off =15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia.

"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry","Background : The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. Methods : We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Case-centered recommendations : Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Limitations : Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Conclusions : Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection (MIS-C): A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","Objective To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Study design Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%).

"Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged =17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. Results In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%–16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2 h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression.

"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","Background COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country.

"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","Purpose The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Methods Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M age = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. Results For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological distress, coping behaviors, and preferences for support among New York healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective The mental health toll of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCW) is not yet fully described. We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th–April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). Results Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. Conclusions NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources. Programs developed to mitigate stress among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate HCW preferences.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.007","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Maternal choline and respiratory coronavirus effects on fetal brain development: Prenatal coronavirus and choline fetal brain effects","Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6–16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants’ level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (=7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels =7.5 µM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Correlates of symptoms of anxiety and depression and mental wellbeing associated with COVID-19: a cross-sectional study of UK-based respondents","Background: The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. Results: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and =75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and =£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46).

"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Background Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100327","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Signal of increased opioid overdose during COVID-19 from emergency medical services data","Background Individuals with opioid use disorder may be at heightened risk of opioid overdose during the COVID-19 period of social isolation, economic distress, and disrupted treatment services delivery. This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Methods We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. Results Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. Conclusions This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation","Introduction With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have been forced to follow strict social isolation guidelines. While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. Materials and methods An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Conclusion Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence and correlates of PTSD and depressive symptoms one month after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in a sample of home-quarantined Chinese university students","Background When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. Method The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. Results The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. Conclusions The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?","Introduction Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive peptides/proteins, immune molecules and inflammatory mediators which are known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. Objective Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. Methodology We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. Conclusion More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The proteasome as a druggable target with multiple therapeutic potentialities: Cutting and non-cutting edges","Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an adaptable and finely tuned system that sustains proteostasis network under a large variety of physiopathological conditions. Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19","Background Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. Methods Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Results Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children’s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. Conclusion For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated.

"Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation","Background Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression.

"Time from COVID-19 shutdown, gender-based violence exposure, and mental health outcomes among a state representative sample of California residents","Background There is increasing evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant shutdowns on mental health. This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. Findings Nearly one in five (19•7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15•5% had a history of IPV and 10•1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. Interpretation Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

"An analysis on self-management and treatment-related functionality and characteristics of highly rated anxiety apps","Background and objective Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. Method A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. Results A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Conclusions Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a large academic medical center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness","Background Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. Methods We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, written by family and healthcare workers during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay >72 h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychological symptom screening with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at baseline within 1 week of ICU discharge and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up, (n = 18) in the diary intervention group and (n = 17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. Conclusions Results from psychological screening tools demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in clinical practice – patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier—prolonged psychological morbidity.

"Quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak: Changes in diet and physical activity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease","Aims CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Data synthesis Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home. Conclusion Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020","20200828",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"University students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece","The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113111","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental health status of medical staff in emergency departments during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in China","Background The emergency department is considered to be a high-risk area, as it is often the first stop for febrile patients who are subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. Methods Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. Outcomes A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. Interpretation The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbances, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Correlation between immune response and self-reported depression during convalescence from COVID-19","Self-reported depression has been observed in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during discharge from the hospital. However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Subjective neurological symptoms frequently occur in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection","Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata”, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. Results We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms are present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 ± 3.8 vs 7.5 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 ± 4.3 vs 5.3 ± 3.8; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 ± 2.7 vs 4.3 ± 2.6; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22) and depression (4.1 ± 2.5 vs 3.6 ± 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR] = 1.29; P < 0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR = 1.45; P < 0.001).

"COVID 19–Depression and Neurosurgeons","Objective The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28).

"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. Interpretation Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID-19","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, China. It typically presents with mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and may have life threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, shock, and even death. Coronavirus infections are known to have neuroinvasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients in the TriNetX database, which is a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data from a network of health care organizations (HCOs) from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headache (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%), Encephalopathy (2.3%), Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%) and 0.6% had seizures. Most common psychiatric manifestations included anxiety and other related disorders (4.6%), mood disorders (3.8%), while 0.2% patients had suicidal ideation. Early recognition and prompt management of neuropsychiatric manifestations in these patients have a potential to decrease overall morbidity and mortality.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.020","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Projected increases in suicide in Canada as a consequence of COVID-19","Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide. We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority. Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113104","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Incremental validity of coronaphobia: Coronavirus anxiety explains depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety","The adverse psychological effects of COVID-19 have increased globally. Moreover, the psychological toll may be worsening for this health crisis due to the growing numbers of mass deaths and unemployment levels. Coronaphobia, a relatively new pandemic-related construct, has been shown to be strongly related to functional impairment and psychological distress. However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

A cross-sectional study was conducted. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts & Humanities and Social Sciences & Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering & Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown.

Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of =9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.

This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores = 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores = 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores = 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety.

"Depression, anxiety, stress levels of physicians and associated factors in Covid-19 pandemics","Aim To investigate anxiety, stress, and depression levels of physicians during the Covid-19 outbreak and explored associated factors in both clinical and general site. Methods An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Results Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks.

"Filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators","The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in different countries around the world. Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.” Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Media use and acute psychological outcomes during COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 outbreak in China led to an extraordinary threat to public health and wellbeing. This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece Comparison between 2019 and 2020","In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70–79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Protocol for a partially nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the scleroderma patient-centered intervention network COVID-19 home-isolation activities together (SPIN-CHAT) program to reduce anxiety among at-risk scleroderma patients","Objective Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. Methods The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score = 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention.

"Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: A mixed-method study","Since the end of 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of “Perceived Helplessness”, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman’s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Adolescents' Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health","Purpose Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness.

"A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Provision of Emergency Maxillofacial Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Collaborative Five Centre UK Study","The global pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents one of the greatest challenges to healthcare systems, and has forced medical specialties to rapidly adapt their approaches to patient care. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is considered particularly at risk of disease transmission due to aerosol generation during surgical interventions, patient proximity and operating environment. On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home. There were 44 cases of facial fractures with a tendency for conservative treatment. 19 cases were related to domestic violence or self-harm. Of the 216 dental related emergencies, 68% could have been managed in the primary care setting. A quarter of all emergency patients were satisfactorily managed by remote consultations. There was a significant change in the provision of emergency maxillofacial service during the pandemic lockdown. We discuss the study findings as well as the potential implications in relation to planning for possible further COVID- 19 spikes and future pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.05.020","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study","The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Overdose and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019","Background There have been significant efforts to respond to the two public health emergencies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and overdose in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015–2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Psychometric characteristics, reliability and validity in the Israeli population","Mental health clinicians worldwide have been expressing concerns regarding the broad psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Nowhere to hide: The significant impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures on elite and semi-elite South African athletes","Objectives To describe the perceptions of South African elite and semi-elite athletes on return to sport (RTS); maintenance of physical conditioning and other activities; sleep; nutrition; mental health; healthcare access; and knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design Cross- sectional study. Methods A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p <0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. Results 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1–6 months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p <0.0001), daily (61%; p <0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p <0.0001) and for 30–60min (72%). During leisure time athletes preferred sedentary above active behaviour (p <0.0001). Sleep patterns changed significantly (79%; p <0.0001). A significant number of athletes consumed excessive amounts of carbohydrates (76%; p <0.0001; males 73%; females 80%). Many athletes felt depressed (52%), and required motivation to keep active (55%). Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). Conclusions COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry.

"Ayurveda and COVID-19: Where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry","This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service.

"A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p > 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population","Insomnia is a major health issue associated with great psychological burden. Research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia.

"Psychological Outcomes Associated with Stay-at-Home Orders and the Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Daily Life","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the widespread implementation of extraordinary physical distancing interventions (e.g., stay-at-home orders) to slow the spread of the virus. Although vital, these interventions may be socially and economically disruptive, contributing to adverse psychological outcomes. This study examined relations of both stay-at-home orders and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life to psychological outcomes (depression, health anxiety, financial worry, social support, and loneliness) in a nationwide U.S. community adult sample (N = 500; 47% women, mean age = 40). Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological outcomes, stay-at-home order status, and COVID-19’s impact on their daily life. Being under a stay-at-home order was associated with greater health anxiety, financial worry, and loneliness. Moreover, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life was positively associated with health anxiety, financial worry, and social support, but negatively associated with loneliness.

"Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals","Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.

In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

"Frontline nurses’ burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","Background During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. Findings On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. Interpretation The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance","As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and “staying at home” to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns. The present consensus guidance discusses these risks and makes some practical recommendations that may help diminish them.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152180","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers","Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Is returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic stressful? A study on immediate mental health status and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of Chinese workforce","This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.

"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n = 500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p < 0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p < 0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p = 0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p = 0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p = 0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p = 0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p = 0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p = 0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p = 0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p = 0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population.

"Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review","Background and aims COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.040","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I 2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

"Role of electronic media in mitigating the psychological impacts of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","The current research initiative focuses on the role of Pakistani media in eliminating panic and depression among health practitioners and the general public due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In Pakistan, electronic media is the most common source of information due to the higher rural population and the lower literacy rate and media's handling of COVID-19 coverage so far creates panic and depression. We suggest that special televised transmissions featuring psychologists and physiatrists should be aired to reduce the panic.

"COVID-19: Psychological flexibility, coping, mental health, and wellbeing in the UK during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of many people across the globe, both through the direct interpersonal cost of the disease, and the governmental restrictions imposed to mitigate its spread and impact. The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of ‘lockdown’ (15th–21st May 2020) and the specific role of Psychological Flexibility as a potential mitigating process. We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (N = 555). However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress. Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest. No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found. In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses). Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping. We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The moderating roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Italy","The Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility on the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in Italy. Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (M = 39.29 days, SD = 11.26), 1035 adults (79% female, M = 37.5 years, SD = 12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Addictovigilance contribution during COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown in France","Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for abuse and dependence. This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19). COVID-19 epidemic has been an important challenge for addictovigilance, and has proved that this monitoring is highly essential for alerting health professionals and health authorities to points of vigilance in the field of psychoactive substances.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.06.006","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Exploring COVID-19 stress and its factors in Bangladesh: A perception-based study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has aggregated mental health sufferings throughout the entire world. Suicide completions are the extreme consequences of COVID-19 related psychological burdens, which was reported in many countries including Bangladesh. However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its’ associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. Methods An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country. Conclusions Considering the present findings, it is essential to introduce time-oriented policy, and implement care monitoring plans in the country, which may help in managing the pandemic as well as nurturing the public mental health to combat COVID-19 related psychological challenges.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04399","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Navigating crisis from the backseat? How top managers can support radical change initiatives by middle managers","We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives","Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic–A review","Introduction The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Conclusion Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychopathological consequences of confinement","Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A qualitative study on the psychological experience of caregivers of COVID-19 patients","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff. Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The COVID-19 pandemic has paved the way for considerable psychological and psychosocial morbidity among the general public and health care providers. An array of guidelines has been put forward by multiple agencies for combating mental health challenges.

"Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist","The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook.

"Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian Patients Switched to Remote Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Results Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs.

"People experiencing homelessness: Their potential exposure to COVID-19","Background Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Anxiety regarding contracting COVID-19 related to interoceptive anxiety sensations: The moderating role of disgust propensity and sensitivity","The COVID-19 public health crisis has led to extensive recommendations by officials to contain its spread. Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS). A total of N = 908 Chinese adults (mean age = 40.37 years, SD = 9.27; n = 752 female) participated in a survey distributed between February 24 and March 15, 2020. Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19.

"Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health","Background : According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?","Objectifs La pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoqué une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitié de la population planétaire. En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l’offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d’incertitude. L’objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l’exposition des soignants au COVID-19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID-19. Résultats Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, décès de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d’équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A cross-sectional study on mental health among health care workers during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019","The spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global major public health event, threatening people's physical and mental health and even life safety. This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). <U+03C7>2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated Psychological Problems","The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China. Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A crisis within the crisis: The mental health situation of refugees in the world during the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Background 68.5 million people around the world have been forced to leave their houses. Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. Method The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection.

"When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak","Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects. Doctors, not a relative, are inevitably the last people a dying COVID-19 patient will see.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112972","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic","Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review","Objectif L’absence de préparation du système de soins psychiatriques à l’épidémie de virus SARS-CoV-2 fait redouter fait redouter un scénario pessimiste pour la santé physique et mentale des patients suivis en psychiatrie. L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

The respondents (N = 801, 53.8% females; 56.2% with children) came from the five macro-regions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18% South, 10% Central-West). Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our findings and new research directions are discussed.

"Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study","Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166","20200501",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical perspectives from a case series","Introduction The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009","20200401",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Penetrating trauma during a global pandemic: Changing patterns in interpersonal violence, self-harm and domestic violence in the Covid-19 outbreak","Introduction The restrictions imposed on social activity in response to the Covid-19 pandemic have had a profound impact globally. In the UK, the NHS was placed on a war-footing, with elective surgery, face-to-face outpatient clinics, and community care facilities all scaled back as a temporary measure to redistribute scarce resources. There has been concern during this period over increasing levels of violence in the domestic setting, as well as self-harm. Methods Data was collected on all patients presenting with traumatic penetrating injuries during the ‘lockdown’ period of 23rd March to 29th April 2020. Demographics and injury details were compared with the same period in the two preceding years. Results Overall trauma fell by 35% compared with the previous year. Over one in four penetrating injuries seen were a result of self-harm, which was significantly higher than in previous years (11% in 2019, 2% in 2018). There were two cases of injuries due to domestic violence, while a total of 4 cases of injury arose in separate violent domestic incidents. Self-harm commonly involved penetrating injury to the neck. Discussion Our centre has seen an increase in the proportion of penetrating injuries as a result of both self-harm and violence in the domestic setting. The number of penetrating neck injury cases, which can represent suicidal intent or a major presentation of psychiatric illness, is of particular concern. We must further investigate the effect of social restrictions on violent injury, and how home confinement may influence a changing demographic picture of victims.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.surge.2020.07.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of Coronavirus Disease-2019: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the coronavirus disease-2019. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs' neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. Objective: Clarify evidence base regarding the psychiatric side effects and psychiatric drug interactions of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Methods A literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950 to 2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. Results First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of “psychosis after chloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. Weak evidence suggests a possible association of hydroxychloroquine exposure and increased suicidal ideation. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications; however, overdose of these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. Conclusion The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for coronavirus disease-2019 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for coronavirus disease-2019, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on the quality of life for women with ovarian cancer","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for the oncology community. For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled, and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of coronavirus disease 2019 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. Objective We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Study Design Women with a current or previous diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life. The quality of life was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were used to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on quality of life survey scores. Results A total of 603 women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30, 2020, and April 13, 2020, and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range, 20–85). At the time of survey completion, 217 participants (43.3%) were in active treatment. A total of 175 participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay, as did 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheduled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. A total of 133 participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory tests, and 53 (9.6%) cancer-related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety, and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and being self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, being self-described as immunocompromised, and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety, and depression, and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. Conclusion The coronavirus disease 2019 crisis is affecting care of patients with ovarian cancer; surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests, and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise, and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety, and depression.

"Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Relative bradycardia as a clinical feature in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): A report of two cases","We treated two patients with COVID-19 pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation. Case 1 was a 73-year-old Japanese man. Computed tomography (CT) revealed ground-glass opacities in both lungs. He had severe respiratory failure with a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood/fraction of inspiratory oxygen ratio (P/F ratio) of 203. Electrocardiogram showed a heart rate (HR) of 56beats/min, slight ST depression in leads II, III, and aVF, and mild saddle-back type ST elevation in leads V1 and V2. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level was slightly elevated. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, his HR remained within 50–70beats/min. Case 2 was a 52-year-old Japanese woman. CT revealed ground-glass opacities in the lower left lung. Electrocardiogram showed a HR of only 81beats/min, despite a body temperature of 39.2°C, slight ST depression in leads V4, V5, V6, and a prominent U wave in multiple leads. She had an elevated cTnT and a P/F ratio of 165. Despite a high fever and hypoxemia, her HR remained within 50–70beats/min. Both patients had a poor compensatory increase in their HR, despite their critical status. Relative bradycardia could be a cardiovascular complication and is an important clinical finding in patients with COVID-19. <Learning objective: We report two Japanese cases of COVID-19 pneumonia with relative bradycardia as a condition and no significant compensatory increase in heart rate despite high fever and severe hypoxemia. Relative bradycardia in COVID-19 might be associated with myocardial injury due to not only direct viral involvement but also systemic inflammation. We should carefully observe the occurrence of relative bradycardia because it could potentially be a clinical sign of COVID-19.>",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jccase.2020.07.015","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels and Related Factors Among Operating Theater Workers During the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on health care workers because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among health care professionals working in operating theaters (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of health care professionals working in operating theaters in various health care institutions in Turkey. Methods Data were collected online between April 9, 2020 and April 12, 2020 using a SurveyMonkey Questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) and health care workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings A total of 702 health care professionals working in operating theaters participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4 ± 4.6 (min 0 to max 21) and 10.0 ± 4.5 (min 0 to max 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (P < .05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease, and those whose workload increased (P < .05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among health care professionals working in operating theaters. To reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of health care professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Minimal Access Gardening: Laparoscopic Techniques during Coronavirus Disease Lockdown","Objective To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. Design Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. Setting Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. Interventions Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of “cup feeding” is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. Conclusion While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological stress among health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease Outbreak: Cases from online consulting customers","Background During the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, online consulting has been widely used to address mental health problems, including health care professionals (HCPs) caring for COVID-19 patients who experienced substantial psychological distress. Aim To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using <U+03C7>2-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. Results The sample overall (n = 34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS mean = 15.71 ± 4.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-9 = 5) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-7 = 5). Those working at intensive care units (ICUs) or in departments of respiratory medicine (RM) demonstrated significantly higher perceived stress than those at other departments (adjusted mean: 17.48 ± 0.96 vs. 13.06 ± 1.25, p = .018, partial <U+03B7>2 = 0.173). High perceived stress was most strongly associated with being depressed (beta = 0.486, p = .002) and working at ICUs/RM (beta = 0.345, p = .023). Conclusions The psychological health status of frontline health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak warrants clinical attention.

"Patient-reported Outcomes of Patients With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Epicenter of China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study","Introduction We aimed to analyze the psychological status in patients with breast cancer (BC) in the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients and Methods A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. Results Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. Conclusion High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with BC during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the psychological status of patients with BC, especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes, and metastatic BC.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Effect of Social Support on Mental Health in Chinese Adolescents During the Outbreak of COVID-19","Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts physical and mental health. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the levels of social support and mental health among Chinese adolescents during the outbreak. Methods A total of 7,202 adolescents aged 14–18 years completed online survceys from March 8 to 15, 2020, in China. Researchers assessed the associations between depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and social support (Social Support Rate Scale). Results COVID-19 exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–1.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04–1.52). Only 24.6% of adolescents reported high levels of social support. Most adolescents (70%) reported medium levels of support, and 5.4% reported low support. Low support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.38–5.33) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.54–3.98), while controlling for gender, grade, living situation, and COVID-19 exposure; similarly, medium support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.48–3.15) and anxiety (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94–2.48) symptoms.

"Factors related to preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness","Background/Purpose Because of the spread of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019), preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors become important for individuals, especially those who are vulnerable. The present study proposes a model to explain the preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors among people with mental illness in Taiwan. Methods A cross-sectional design was carried out and 414 patients with mental illness (230 males [55.6%]; mean age = 46.32 [SD = 10.86]) agreed to participate in the study. All the participants completed the Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale, Self-Stigma Scale-Short, Believing COVID-19 Information Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. Regression models and structural equation modeling (SEM) were applied to examine the factors associated with preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Results Both regression models and SEM showed that trust in COVID-19 information sources (standardized coefficient [ß] = 0.211 in regression; ß = 0.194 in SEM) and fear of COVID-19 (ß = -0.128 in regression; ß = -0.223 in SEM) significantly explained preventive behaviors among individuals with mental illness. The SEM further showed that fear of COVID-19 was significantly explained by trust in COVID-19 information sources (ß = 0.220) and self-stigma (ß = 0.454). Conclusions Based on the results, healthcare providers should help individuals with mental illness reduce self-stigma and fear of COVID-19 which would consequently improve their preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors. Moreover, improving trust in COVID-19 information sources for individuals with mental illness may be another method to improve their preventive behaviors.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jfma.2020.07.032","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Objective To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. Method This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants’ demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients’ self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients’ mental health. Results Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 = 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 = 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI = 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients’ self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients’ mental health. The disease duration (ß = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients’ mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. Conclusion A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients’ mental symptoms.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Do suicide rates in children and adolescents change during school closure in Japan? The acute effect of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic on child and adolescent mental health","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has severely impacted the lives of children and adolescents. School closure, one of the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in social contacts and increases in family time for children and adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of suicide is unknown. Objective This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during school closure in Japan. Data Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020. Methods Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020. Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also performed. Results We found no significant change in suicide rates during the school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1). Conclusions As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104680","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences: Systematic review of the current evidence","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002–2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. Conclusion Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.048","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of =2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The immediate impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on subjective sleep status","Background An outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been ongoing in China since January 2020. The threat of infection affects the work and life of most of the population and may also damage sleep. This study aims to examine the subjective sleep status and mental health of the population during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method The data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. Results Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p < 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p < 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p < 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups. A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed. Conclusion The results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19. As prevention and treatment efforts continue with regard to COVID-19, the general public has developed poor sleep hygiene habits, which deserve attention.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.018","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study","Background/Objective The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. Method Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. Results In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control. Conclusions The results emphasize the protective effect of PMH in extraordinary situations such as the current outbreak of COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Anxiety and depression in COVID-19 survivors: Role of inflammatory and clinical predictors","Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could induce psychopathology, and psychiatric sequelae were observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks. The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors. We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension. Despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed increased scores on most psychopathological measures, with similar baseline inflammation. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression and anxiety at follow-up. PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years of life lived with disability. Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current insights on inflammation in psychiatry, and the present observation of worse inflammation leading to worse depression, we recommend to assess psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors and to deepen research on inflammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Differences in anxiety, sadness, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and sadness as a function of age and self-perceptions of aging during the lock-out period due to COVID-19","Objetivos Analizar si existen diferencias en función de la edad en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en personas jóvenes, de mediana edad y mayores confinadas debido a la pandemia de la COVID-19, y explorar la relación entre la autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento y nivel de sintomatología psicológica en función del grupo de edad. Método Participan 1.501 personas (rango de edad: 18 a 88 años). Se evaluaron el grado de ansiedad, tristeza y soledad, y la autopercepción del envejecimiento. Se dividió a la muestra en función del grupo de edad y por cuartiles (bajo, intermedios y alto) en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y autopercepción del envejecimiento. Resultados Las personas mayores informan de menor ansiedad y tristeza que los de mediana edad y jóvenes, y los de mediana edad de menores niveles que los jóvenes. Los de mediana edad informan de menor soledad, seguidos de los mayores y los jóvenes. Para cada grupo de edad, aquellos con una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento informan de mayor ansiedad, tristeza y soledad. Hay más comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en jóvenes y menos en mayores; más personas deprimidas en mediana edad, menos mayores con ansiedad, y más mayores y menos jóvenes sin sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva. Para todos los grupos de edad, las personas con comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva son las que tienen puntuaciones altas en autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento. Conclusiones Las personas mayores informan de menos malestar psicológico que otros grupos de edad. Tener una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento perjudica a la salud psicológica, independientemente de la edad. Objectives To analyze differences by age group in anxiety, depression, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and depression in young people, middle aged adults and older adults during the lock-down period at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the association between negative self-perceptions of aging and psychological symptoms controlling by age group. Method Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Results Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging. Conclusions Older adults reported lower psychological anxiety, sadness and loneliness than the other age groups.

"Prevention and treatment of COVID-19 in the pediatric population from the family and community perspective","Partiendo del informe sobre la situación de la COVID-19 en España, del 3 de abril del 2020, los casos confirmados ascienden a 117.710, de los que 343 tienen una edad inferior a 14 años (< 1%). Es fundamental conocer la especificidad de este proceso en la población infantil, así como las recomendaciones específicas para una adecuada prevención y cuidado de los niños durante la pandemia por la COVID-19. Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la evidencia científica sobre las recomendaciones específicas para la atención pediátrica en casos de COVID-19 desde el ámbito familiar y comunitario. Se han seleccionado y analizado las principales recomendaciones y medidas preventivas en los entornos de Atención Primaria de salud y el domicilio desde un enfoque integrador dónde se incluyen los aspectos biopsicosociales del niño durante el confinamiento. La importancia de los cuidados de la infancia frente a la enfermedad radican sobre todo en asegurar las correctas medidas de prevención del contagio por la condición de actuar como posibles portadores durante un período de incubación de hasta 21 días. La recomendación es que los niños participen activamente en las acciones preventivas habituales para la contención de la expansión de la enfermedad. A nivel domiciliario, el aislamiento supone un importante reto para las familias donde se presentan manifestaciones de incertidumbre, miedo e indefensión ante los cambios y entre las recomendaciones se encuentran establecer rutinas orden mediante horarios de actividades y ocio unido a las medidas de higiene. Dada la rapidez con la que se ha producido la pandemia por SARS-CoV-2, existen pocas evidencias del impacto en niños en España por el momento. Es necesario desarrollar estudios específicos sobre prevención y tratamiento en la edad pediátrica para mejorar las recomendaciones disponibles. Based on the report on the situation of COVID-19 in Spain, dated April 3, 2020, the confirmed cases amount to 117,710, of which 343 are under 14 years of age (< 1%). It is essential to know the specificity of this process in the child population, as well the specific recommendations for proper prevention and care of children during the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper aim is to analyze the scientific evidence on the specific recommendations for pediatric care in cases of COVID-19 from the family and community settings. The main recommendations and preventive measures in primary health care settings and at home have been selected and analyzed from an integrative approach that includes the biopsychosocial aspects of the child during confinement. The importance of caring for children in the face of the disease lies above all in ensuring the correct measures for the prevention of contagion due to the condition of acting as possible carriers during an incubation period of up to 21 days. The recommendation is that children actively participate in routine preventive actions to contain the spread of the disease. At the household level, isolation is an important challenge for families where there are manifestations of uncertainty, fear and helplessness in the face of changes and among the recommendations are establishing routines and order through schedules of activities and leisure together with hygiene measures. Given the rapidity with which the COVID-19 pandemic has occurred, there is little evidence at the moment. Research on prevention and treatment in the pediatric age needs to be developed to improve the available recommendations.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.enfcli.2020.05.005","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Anxiety and depression and the related factors in nurses of Guilan University of Medical Sciences hospitals during COVID-19: A web-based cross-sectional study","Background The outbreak of COVID-19 is an unprecedented challenge to the health systems in Iran. We aimed to assess the psychological impact of this outbreak on nurses in the hospitals of Guilan University of Medical Sciences that is one of the top provinces of incidence of COVID-19. Methods In a web-based cross-sectional study, 441 nurses working were selected from the hospitals, from 7 to 12 April 2020. Anxiety and depression were measured using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, respectively. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify the factors related to anxiety and depression. Results The majority were in contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases (93.4%) and their relatives had been infected with COVID-19 (42%). The mean of anxiety-7 and depression total scores were 8.64 ± 5.60 and 8.48 ± 6.19, respectively. Female (OR = 3.27, 95% CI = 1.01–10.64), working in COVID-19 designated hospital (OR = 1.82, 95% CI = 1.13–2.93), being suspected with COVID-19 infection (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.25–3.26), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = 1.68–4.06) were associated with anxiety. Depression was significantly associated with female sex (OR = 4.62, %95 CI = 1.24–17.16), having chronic disease (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.20–3.74), being suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 infection (OR = 3.44, 95% CI = 2.11–5.59, and OR = 2.21, 95% CI = 1.04–4.70, respectively), and insufficient personal protective equipment (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.19–2.91). Conclusion The finding declares healthcare workers are at high risk for mental illness. Continuous supervision of the psychological consequences following infectious diseases outbreaks should be a part of the preparedness efforts of health care systems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijans.2020.100233","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Infertility remains a top stressor despite the COVID-19 pandemic","Research question What is the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertility patients? Design An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice in the USA between 1 January 2019 and 1 April 2020. At three different time-points respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of 10 commonly reported life stressors. Results The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients, with 3604 responses (response rate 34%) received. A total of 2202 non-pregnant female respondents were included in the final analysis. One-third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one-quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking antidepressant medications. At all three time-points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor among the respondents in early March but, at the time of writing, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66%, respectively). A total of 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Accelerated Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation in Late-Life Depression: A Possible Option for Older Depressed Adults in Need of ECT During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an essential psychiatric service with an important role in treating older adults with severe or treatment-resistant depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have be constrained by infection control measures. We report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a severe major depressive episode who had previously responded to right unilateral ECT and was treated with two modified accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols. Methods The two aiTBS courses consisted of eight daily sessions over five consecutive days, followed by gradual tapering, using 1,800 pulses per session pre-COVID-19 (first course), and 600 pulses per session during the pandemic (second course). Results Moderate to severe baseline depressive symptoms reached remission levels after both courses. Conclusion The 600-pulses aiTBS treatment protocol reported here warrants further study and evaluation, but may be a potential option in cases where older adults with severe depressive symptoms cannot access ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids.

"Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups","Objective To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. Method A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. Results A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 ± 18.9, 47.3 ± 13.1, and 43.2 ± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. Conclusion The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention.

En esta situación, el personal sanitario está viviendo altos niveles de estrés por la sobrecarga de trabajo y las condiciones de este. El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar los factores que pueden desestabilizar la salud mental de dichos profesionales en nuestro contexto. Materiales y métodos La muestra estuvo compuesta por 421 profesionales de la salud. Los datos se recogieron mediante un cuestionario online que se les envió a través del correo electrónico. Se empleó el DASS-21 para evaluar las variables de ansiedad, estrés y depresión, y la EAI para medir las dificultades con el sueño. Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores. Esto contribuye a que desarrollen sintomatología psicológica diversa. Consecuentemente, se recomienda ofrecerles ayuda psicológica para reducir el impacto emocional del COVID-19 y asegurar así no solo su salud mental, sino también el adecuado cuidado que dispensan. Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Strategies to Promote Social Connections Among Older Adults During “Social Distancing” Restrictions","Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for coronavirus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, the authors describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a “Connections Plan” to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during “social distancing” restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a “Safety Plan” for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?","Ce texte envisage de porter un regard sur les conséquences psychologiques de la situation sanitaire liée au COVID-19 à partir du concept d’optimisme. Depuis plusieurs années, la psychologie positive s’est saisie de cette notion déjà bien connue du grand public, qui a également fait l’objet d’une élaboration conceptuelle majeure dans le domaine scientifique. À ce titre, il nous semble que le concept d’optimisme soit particulièrement utile et pertinent pour comprendre les conduites de nos concitoyens et son influence possible dans la période de confinement qui s’impose actuellement à tous, de la même manière qu’il est nécessaire de penser l’« après » et ses conséquences à court, moyen et long terme, tant sur le plan économique que sur celui de la santé morale et physique de nos concitoyens. Traditionnellement, être optimiste c’est être confiant dans l’issue positive d’un événement, alors qu’à l’inverse, le pessimisme, c’est plutôt s’attendre au pire. L’incertitude que nous imposent ce virus et les situations inédites qui en découlent nous contraint à penser le monde de demain en des termes nouveaux, ce qui peut être déstabilisant. Comprendre la contribution du concept d’optimisme dans la potentialisation des processus adaptatifs que chacun de nous pourra ou non mobiliser pour faire face et s’adapter à cette crise sanitaire inédite et sans précédent est essentiel. Cela constituera sans doute un défi majeur pour les sciences sociales et la psychologie. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous pensons que le concept d’optimisme peut contribuer à apporter des éléments d’éclairage complémentaires qui nous permettront de mieux saisir les conduites rationnelles (ou non) auxquelles nous pourrions être confrontés dans l’avenir, et dans lesquelles nous sommes déjà impliqués. This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety, and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020, showed that the general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). Conclusion: Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers, and patients with mental disorders. Community mental health service systems, online mental health services, telemedicine, and other measures for patients with mental disorders may play a vital role during the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.005","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Role of Psychiatry in Treating Burnout Among Nurses During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The prevalence of burnout among US registered nurses ranges from 35 to 45%. In one study, nurses had twice the rate of depression compared with other health care professionals. Owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, burnout is a major threat to the stability of the workforce on the front lines. Consultation-liaison (C/L) psychiatry can provide assistance through liaison meetings, stress management programs, and curbside consults to help reduce the risk of burnout. Narrative medicine programs, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and meditation apps are additional means to alleviate stress. Given the current challenges facing C/L psychiatry and the mental health field in general, there is an urgent need to overcome stigma and financial barriers to make treatment readily accessible.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jradnu.2020.06.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Mental Health Benefits of Physical Activity in Older Adults Survive the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective To determine the relationship between the amount and intensity of physical activity performed by older adults in North America (United States and Canada) and their depression and anxiety symptoms while currently under social distancing guidelines (SDG) for the COVID-19 pandemic. Design Descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. Participants About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. Measurements Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. Results Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG “Most of the time” or “Strictly.” Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. Conclusions These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 lockdown in people with severe mental disorders in Spain: Do they have a specific psychological reaction compared with other mental disorders and healthy controls?","The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown restrictions could have adverse consequences for patients with severe mental disorders (SMD). Here, we aim to compare the early psychological impact (depression, anxiety, and stress responses, intrusive and avoidant thoughts, and coping strategies) on people with SMD (n = 125) compared with two control groups: common mental disorders (CMD, n = 250) and healthy controls (HC, n = 250). An anonymous online questionnaire using a snowball sampling method was conducted from March 19–26, 2020 and included sociodemographic and clinical data along with the DASS-21 and IES scales. We performed descriptive and bivariate analyses and multinomial and linear regression models. People with SMD had higher anxiety, stress, and depression responses than HC, but lower scores than CMD in all domains. Most people with SMD (87.2%) were able to enjoy free time, although control groups had higher percentages. After controlling for confounding factors, anxiety was the only significant psychological domain with lower scores in HC than people with SMD (OR = 0.721; 95% CI: 0.579–0.898). In the SMD group, higher anxiety was associated with being single (beta = 0.144), having COVID-19 symptoms (beta = 0.146), and a higher score on the stress subscale of DASS-21 (beta = 0.538); whereas being able to enjoy free time was a protective factor (beta = -0.244). Our results showed that patients with SMD reacted to the pandemic and the lockdown restrictions with higher anxiety levels than the general public, and suggesting this domain could be a criterion for early intervention strategies and closer follow-up.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.schres.2020.07.018","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Dexmedetomidine and worsening hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19: A case report","Emergency department management of hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19 is riddled with uncertainty. The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health in Elderly Spanish People in Times of COVID-19 Outbreak","Background We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. Results One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged =60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]); and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]). There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. Conclusions Older people have shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women.

"Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent","Background The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. Methods An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. Results A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32–70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0–34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (P = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (>60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. Conclusions The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public–private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Jail incarceration, social sanitary confinement and ways of escape","L’enfermement carcéral et le confinement socio-sanitaire liés à la pandémie du COVID-19 sont rapprochés à la faveur de la diffusion du film documentaire de Valérie Müller Danser sa peine, en notant des comportements réactionnels similaires de la population qui imagine et invente des moyens pour bouger, s’occuper… Le film évoque les ateliers de danse menés dans la prison Les Baumettes de Marseille par le chorégraphe renommé Angelin Preljocaj avec des détenues, jusqu’à la performance Soul Kitchen (1919) dansée hors les murs, bien accueillie par le public. L’expérience carcérale conforte les détenues-danseuses dans les processus de conscience sensorielle et identitaire, d’estime de soi, de réintégration sociale. Les répercussions touchant les corps et les âmes renvoient aussi à une réflexion –en miroir– sur l’actualité anxiogène et contraignante du confinement : cohabitation dans le respect d’autrui ou insupportable (surnombre, conflit, violence conjugale…), détresse des personnes vulnérables ou isolées en EHPAD malgré des aménagements soignant… en insistant sur les ressources psychocorporelles positives, vitalisantes, propices à de bienfaisantes « évasions ». Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women start with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, lead by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women's physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population –youth to elderly– try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

"Pathogenicity of a QX-like avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated in China","Avian infectious bronchitis is a serious and highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez568","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Experiences, impacts and mental health functioning during a COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown: Data from a diverse New York City sample of college students","In March 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which resulted in a 78-day mass confinement of all residents other than essential workers. The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 911 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of students’ daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Each of these life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support students’ well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath.","Teresa Lopez-Castro et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-F5E-885","20200904","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; mass confinement; college students; depression; gender differences; ptsd; covid-19; racial/ethnic differences; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Supporting Families to Protect Child Health: Parenting Quality and Household Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic-linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent-child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.","Leslie E Roos et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A","20200904","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; psychology; covid; maternal-child health; family; mental health; child development; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants (N =14,393; Observations =48,486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June, 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score =3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April, 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%), 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April, 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI [14.3%-22.9%]), followed by females and high income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June, 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. Conclusions This study suggests that a pronounced and prolonged deterioration in mental health occurred as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the UK between April and June, 2020.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-538-ECB","20200610","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; psychological distress; mental health; representative study; coronavirus; covid-19; public health; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"ABC framework of fear of COVID-19 for psychotherapeutic intervention in Nepal: a review","The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on physical and mental health. Most studies report the impact on mental health and mental distress during the pandemic. As a result of various stressors (such as lockdown, quarantines, and misinformation) there is heightened fear of a pandemic. The sufferer may experience a variety of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. In predisposed vulnerable individuals, fear of COVID-19 is perpetuating pain and dysfunction. This study discussed the ABC framework of fear and influencer to better understand the different levels of symptoms and interventions. There is an urgent need to integrate mental health into primary health-care centers. The attending physician should be aware of the stress disorders associated with the pandemic. This article introduces a handy and practical portrayal of the ABC framework that can be taught to individuals in distress during clinical visits to primary care centers providing awareness of the relationship between thinking, emotional and behavioral responses.","Dhirendra Paudel","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C8-025-8F0","20200904","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; phobia; abc; coronaphobia; anxiety; depression; psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Hughes et al (2020) 'I feel cancer patients have been neglected'","Purpose This study aimed to explore the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic including Government-enforced restrictions, on women diagnosed with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer in the UK using a mixed-methods approach. Methods Depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-7), optimism (LOT-R) and perceived risk of recurrence (IPQ-BCS) were measured pre-COVID-19 outbreak and perceived vulnerability, severity and impact of COVID-19 were measured during the UK lockdown period of 23rd March-13th May 2020. Free text responses provided qualitative data. Descriptive statistics regarding COVID-19-specific behaviours and correlations between pre-COVID-19 psychosocial factors and COVID-19 outcomes were conducted. Thematic analysis was conducted on qualitative responses. Quantitative and qualitative data are presented together. Results 253 responses were received during the UK lockdown period. Twenty-six percent of the sample were shielding and 15% felt at higher risk of contracting COVID-19. Higher pre-COVID-19 depression and anxiety and lower optimism were associated with higher perceived vulnerability to and severity of COVID-19 and lower confidence in protecting oneself. There were positive and negative effects of lockdown on exercise and relationships and 42% reported negative impacts on anxiety. Participants reported fear of COVID-19, difficulties with adapting to isolation and using technology, and anxiety about the impact of delayed cancer treatment on their cancer recovery and recurrence. Conclusions Negative effects of lockdown, particularly for delayed cancer treatment should be considered to manage ongoing anxiety. Screening of state depression and anxiety is suggested for intervention prioritisation, but more longitudinal research is needed to understand the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast cancer survivors.","Lyndsay Hughes et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615C-857-651","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Illness; anxiety; mixed-methods; breast cancer; covid-19; isolation; qualitative; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Understanding the lived experiences of Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interpretative phenomenological analysis","Background: Little research has examined mental health and well-being in the context of healthcare professionals (HCP) working during the COVID-19 pandemic within the UK. To our knowledge, no research has employed qualitative methodologies in order to examine this. We therefore aim to address this gap in research by qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to qualitatively examine the lived experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one broadly captured present and future challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic. Theme two captured the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs and theme three captured HCPs’ perceptions of the attitudes of the general public towards HCPs. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort.","Emily Mcglinchey et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032","20200724","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; psychological wellbeing; qualitative research; key workers; covid-19; healthcare professionals; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea","South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. We aimed to document the mental health outcome in relation to social factors during the pandemic. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.","Hyeon-Seung Lee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46091-F8D-4FA","20200830","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; stress; depression; anxiety; social isolation; mental health; covid-19; psychosis; loneliness; korea","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings","COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample. C19PRC Study data has strong generalisability to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research on important public health questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Orla Mcbride et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-F99-C18","20200611","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological wellbeing of frontline workers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: First and second wave findings from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study","Background: Extant research relating to the psychological impact of infectious respiratory disease epidemics/pandemics suggests that frontline workers are particularly vulnerable. Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of ‘lockdown’ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 – 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%). Conclusions: These findings offer timely and valuable information on the psychological health status of UK’s frontline workforce during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and may aid in preparations for their future psychological and mental health support.","Jamie Murphy et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600F-C85-1DA","20200617","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Pandemic buying: Testing a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying using data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Over-purchasing and hoarding of necessities is a common response to crises, especially in developed economies where there is normally an expectation of plentiful supply. This behaviour was observed internationally early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of actual scarcity, this behaviour can be described as ‘panic buying’ and can lead to temporary shortages. However, there have been few psychological studies of this phenomenon. We propose a psychological model of over-purchasing informed by animal foraging theory and make predictions about variables that predict over-purchasing by either exacerbating or mitigating the anticipation of future scarcity. These variables include additional scarcity cues (e.g. loss of income), distress (e.g. depression), psychological factors that draw attention to these cues (e.g. neuroticism) or to reassuring messages (eg. analytical reasoning) or which facilitate over-purchasing (e.g. income). We tested our model in parallel nationally representative internet surveys of the adult general population conducted in the United Kingdom (UK: N = 2025) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI: N = 1041) 52 and 31 days after the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the UK and RoI, respectively. About three quarters of participants reported no or very little over-purchasing. More over-purchasing in RoI may have reflected different government messaging or historical factors. When over-purchasing occurred, it was observed across a wide range of product categories and was accounted for by a single latent factor. It was positively predicted by household income, the presence of children at home, psychological distress (depression, death anxiety), threat sensitivity (right wing authoritarianism) and mistrust of others (paranoia). Analytic reasoning ability had an inhibitory effect. Predictor variables accounted for 36% and 34% of the variance in over-purchasing in the UK and RoI respectively. With some caveats, the data supported our model and point to strategies to mitigate over-purchasing in future crises.","Richard Bentall et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46216-035-A5C","20200819","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; over-purchasing; general population; psychological; panic buying; pandemic; coronavirus; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong","Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing are effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health have not been investigated. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I. = [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% (95% C.I. = [18.2%, 27.2%]) of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis risk. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not social network size, were associated with increased psychiatric symptoms. To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness.","Ivy Fei Tso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5","20200627","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; mental health; social isolation; loneliness; covid-19; stress; psychiatry; psychosis risk; depression; psychosis","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Child and parent physical activity, sleep and screen time during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic nationally representative data and associations with mental health","Objective: To investigate differences in movement behaviors (physical activity, sleep, screen time) in both parents and children during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, compared to pre-COVID-19 national data; and, estimate associations between these movement behaviors with parent and child mental health. Methods: We used cross-sectional baseline data from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Study (CPAS; N=2,365). Participants were parents of children aged =18 years, residing in Australia. We drew on nationally representative pre-COVID data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC; N=9,438). In both studies, parents provided the same self-report measures of physical activity, sleep quality, as well as measures of child physical activity and screen time. Parents reported on their own and their child’s mental health. Results: Compared to LSAC, children in CPAS had more sleep problems (17.4% vs 8.9%, p<.001) and more weekend screen time (3.98 hours vs 3.35 hours, p<.001), while more parents had poor sleep quality (56.7% vs 21.0%, p<.001) despite increased weekly physical activity (3.86 days vs 2.85 days, p<.001). Children’s sleep problems were associated with increased depression, anxiety and irritability symptoms, after accounting for physical activity and screen time (all p<.001). Poorer parent sleep quality and lower levels of physical activity were associated with poorer mental health across all indicators (all p=.001). Conclusion: Government funded mental health programs to implement evidence-based sleep interventions for children and their parents, along with targeted messaging around physical activity should be considered to promote mental health within the family context during lockdown restrictions.","Lisa Olive et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-C6F-F9C","20200902","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; anxiety; adult; parent; mental health; screen-time; children; depression; family; covid-19; sleep; physical activity","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"“I hate this”: A qualitative analysis of adolescents’ self-reported challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges for adolescents due to disruptions in school and social life. We compiled high schoolers’ open-ended responses to the following question: “What are your 3 biggest challenges right now?” (N=717). Using open and axial coding, we identified N=1902 thematic units (M=2.64, SD=.701) and 14 thematic categories, including mental health, physical health, family, friends, social connection and community, academics, missing important events, socioeconomic, routine, COVID rules and adjustment (e.g., social distancing), contraction/exposure to COVID, technology (e.g., screen time), and future plans. Adolescents most commonly reported challenges related to academics (23.7%), but also cited high numbers of challenges in mental (14.8%) and physical health (13.2%), and friend (11.4%) domains. These findings suggest that efforts should focus on helping adolescents cultivate academic skills needed during school closures, providing mental and physical health resources, and helping adolescents navigate their peer relationships in the short and long-term given ongoing remote education and social distancing due to the pandemic.","Samantha Scott et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-ACD-28C","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; social distancing; public health; school closures; adolescents; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.","Jeffrey Wardell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593","20200615","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; stress; income; alcohol problems; social isolation; drinking alone; depression; coping; solitary drinking; alcohol; covid-19; social distancing; coronavirus; drinking motives; parent","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity?","In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of lockdown that impacted individual’s lifestyles, in both professional and personal spheres. New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity. Our results provide new insights on the impact of lockdown and its positive outcomes. These measures may have inarguably negative consequences on the physical and mental health of many, but their positive impact exists as well.","Maxence Mercier et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-44D-278","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Creativity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Innovation and Technology; covid-19; creativity development; creativity; pro-c; little-c; positive outcome; lockdown","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The role of personality in shaping pandemic response: Systemic sociopolitical factors drive country differences","The current study utilizes the current COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of external political and economic factors in personality public-health research. We investigated the extent to which systemic factors modify the relationship between personality and pandemic response. Results shed doubt on the cross-cultural generalizability of common big-five factor models. Individual differences only predicted government compliance in autocratic countries and in countries with income inequality. Personality was only predictive of mental health outcomes under conditions of state fragility and autocracy. Finally, there was little evidence that the big five traits were associated with preventive behaviors. Our ability to use individual differences to understand policy-relevant outcomes changes based on environmental factors and must be assessed on a trait-by-trait basis, thus supporting the inclusion of systemic political and economic factors in individual differences models.","Meghan Siritzky et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-8FA-A5B","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; democracy; gini; personality; autocracy; pandemic; polity; covid-19; state fragility; health behavior; individual differences","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Standalone smartphone CBT-based Ecological Momentary Interventions to increase mental health - a narrative review","Introduction: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphone with the aim to increase the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and provide scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles which are considered as a gold standard for the treatment of many mental health problems. Objective: This review aimed to investigate standalone smartphone-based ‘ecological momentary interventions’ (EMIs) to improve mental health, that were built based on principles derived from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between 1st January 2007 and 15th January 2020. We included studies with a focus on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, and/or efficacy and/or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, e.g., app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, i.e., choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in primary outcomes used in the studies. Results: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (m=70.8%), and outcomes were satisfying by users (m=72.6%). Conclusions: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, hence limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily life. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.","Marta Anna Marciniak et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-8DA-A42","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; covid-19; emi; mhealth; ecological momentary intervention; cbt; cognitive behavioral therapy; mobile app","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A COVID-19 descriptive study of life after lockdown in Wuhan, China","On April 8th, 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between the 3rd and 7th of April, 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18th and 22nd of April, 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6th and 10th of May, 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25th and 29th of May, 2020 (Time 4). This 4-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents’ psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted. The Stage 1 manuscript associated with this submission received in-principle acceptance (IPA) on 2 June 2020. Following IPA, the accepted Stage 1 version of the manuscript was preregistered on the OSF at https://osf.io/g2t3b. This preregistration was performed prior to data analysis. Generally, our study found that: 1) a majority of people still continue to value self-isolation after lockdown was lifted; 2) by the end of lockdown, people perceived gradual return to normalcy and restored structure of everyday life; 3) the psychological well-being slightly improved after lockdown was lifted; 4) people who utilized problem-solving and help-seeking as coping strategies during lockdown had better well-being and mental health by the end of the lockdown; 5) those who experienced more disruptions in daily life during lockdown would display more indicators of psychological ill-being by the end of the lockdown.","Tong Zhou et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-51B-49F","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; stress; covid-19; well-being; coping; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The psychological distress in students during the COVID-19 crisis: An 8-wave longitudinal study","The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in psychological distress during initial stage of the coronavirus pandemic in Croatia. The sample consisted of 363 students with an average age of 23.42 years. The results show that students in Croatia reported average levels of depression, anxiety and stress, with no differences in the degree of psychological distress between the pre-pandemic period and the pandemic period. Of the respondents, 19.48%, 28.8% and 22.08% respectively reported moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress, which remained largely stable during the survey period. All significant differences during the 8-week period show that depression, anxiety and stress generally decrease over time.","Anita Vulic-Prtoric et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611F-19C-F12","20200829","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; anxiety; stress; longitudinal study; students; covid -19 pandemic; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Toward Data-Based Case Conceptualization: A Functional Analysis Approach With Ecological Momentary Assessment","Network analyses and process-based approaches to psychotherapy are thrilling developments for psychotherapy research and practice, but they lack a therapeutic rationale for the individual selection of treatment modules. Conceptualizing the conditional relations around human responses using functional analysis could guide case conceptualization and treatment planning. In a pilot study with four participants (a 30- and a 25-year-old man; a 19- and a 44-year-old woman), we developed and tested the feasibility and acceptance of an assessment that comprises elements of functional analysis for participants with emotional disorders. We assessed an individualized set of items three times per day, for a period of 30 days, with ecological momentary assessment while participants were waiting for psychotherapy. The implementation proved to be both feasible and accepted; participants did not report any side effects. Three datasets were included in the analysis; one had to be excluded because the minimum response rate of 80% (out of 90 data points) was not met. P-factor and network analyses revealed meaningful behavioral clusters (e.g., participant 1: hopelessness, procrastination, coping, avoidance). The assessment is a promising diagnostic tool that helps participants and therapists identify and systemize relevant behavior patterns and to draw conclusions for treatment planning.","Saskia Scholten et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613B-ED2-B84","20200824","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; case conceptualization; functional analysis; network analysis; depression; ecological momentary assessment; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Finding the Power Within: Is Resilience Protective Against Symptoms of Stress, Anxiety, and Depression in Australian Parents During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The present study utilised a strengths-based approach to investigate the association between resilience and indicators of mental health in a large sample of Australian parents at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was nested within a large longitudinal cohort study of Australian parents of a child aged 0-18 years. Hierarchical regression models were run to examine the relationship between the variables of interest. Of 2,110 respondents included, 1701 (80.6%) were female. Higher resilience was associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Loneliness was a key contributor to mental health outcomes. An increase in extraversion was associated with improved resilience. The relationship between resilience and depression was influenced by the level of partner support. Interventions targeting mental health of parents at the time of pandemics should focus on reducing loneliness while working with the constraints of imposed social isolation, and to include partners.","Antonina Mikocka-Walus et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606E-FF3-17E","20200825","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health difficulties of adults with COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh: a case control-study","Introduction The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with inefficient testing capacities in Bangladesh has resulted in a number of deaths from COVID-19-like symptoms that have no official test results. Insufficient test sites and healthcare facilities catered to COVID-19 has led to feelings of fear and frustration in those who are sick. This study was the first study which explored the mental health of adults with the most common COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh. Methods This retrospective case control study gathered data via an online survey to explore the mental health of Bangladeshi adults with symptoms akin to COVID-19. Level of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were measured with the DASS-21. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms of overall population were 26.9% and 52.0% respectively and 55.6% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression determined that respondents with COVID-19-like symptoms (case) reported higher odds for stress level (AOR: 2.043; CI: 1.51-2.76), anxiety symptoms (AOR: 2.770; CI: 2.04-3.77) and depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.482; CI: 1.12-1.96) than asymptomatic respondents (control). Conclusion Patients with symptoms like those of COVID-19 should be prioritized in the healthcare setting in order to reduce mental health difficulties throughout the pandemic.","Musammet Rasheda Begum et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46231-822-F17","20200827","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; covid-19 like sympttoms; mental health; case-control; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19: An online cross-sectional survey among Bangladeshi residents","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19) rapidly infects people across the world, leading to a massive public reaction. Peoples’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 are the most important for the control and prevention of the pandemic infectious disease. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude & practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among Bangladeshi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 1765 respondents was conducted through the social media networks of authors. The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD: 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD: 1.8, ranging: 0-17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. About 67.2 % scored well (above the mean: 4.5, range: 1-5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wear mask outside the home, and 98.7% washed hand with soap when came back. COVID-19 knowledge score was significantly associated with a lower risk of (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.92) of negative attitudes. Again, the awareness score was associated with a lower likelihood of (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98) of poor practices. Online health education programs focusing on young people, housewife and people with less education may potentially improve the attitudes and practices to control the COVID-19 pandemic in long term in such a low resource setting.","Satyajit Kundu et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-F2E-68D","20200827","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; practise; knowledge; cocid-19; attitude","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Addressing COVID-19 Worry and Social Isolation in Home-Based Primary Care","Social distancing measures following the outbreak of COVID-19 have led to a rapid shift to virtual and telephone care. Social workers and mental health providers in VA home-based primary care (HBPC) teams face challenges providing psychosocial support to their homebound, medically complex, socially isolated patient population who are high risk for poor health outcomes related to COVID-19. We developed and disseminated an 8-week telephone or virtual group intervention for front-line HBPC social workers and mental health providers to use with socially isolated, medically complex older adults. The intervention draws on skills from evidence-based psychotherapies for older adults including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and Problem-Solving Therapy. The manual was disseminated to VA HBPC clinicians and geriatrics providers across the United States in March 2020 for expeditious implementation. Eighteen HBPC teams and three VA Primary Care teams reported immediate delivery of a local virtual or telephone group using the manual. In this paper we describe the manual’s development and clinical recommendations for its application across geriatric care settings. Future evaluation will identify ways to meet longer-term social isolation and evolving mental health needs for this patient population as the pandemic continues.","Rachel Elizabeth Weiskittle et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DB-0C0-3C1","20200825","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Aging; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"When Social Interaction Backfires: Frequent Social Interaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period Is Associated with Decreased Well-Being and Higher Panic Buying","The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying. Overall, our findings indicated that frequent social interaction under a highly novel and uncertain crisis can induce negative consequences on mental health and behavior.","Hyunji Kim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-63E-D8A","20200703","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; well-being; social interaction; panic buying; general confidence level; self-other connectedness; word-of-mouth; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.","Samantha M.

"Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing","Background and Objectives: Covid-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. Research Design and Methods: We conducted two online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards, COVID-19 beliefs, social distancing behaviors, and mental health symptoms. We used the initial study (N = 233) to form our hypotheses about social distancing behaviors and we ran the second, pre-registered study (N = 243) to determine if these relationships replicated. Results: We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Although older adults reported being more likely to contract Covid-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall Covid-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. Discussion and Implications: These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.","Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the US","Background: Stressful events due to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity/reliability of the PSQ and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.","Autumn Kujawa et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E","20200629","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Staying ‘In Sync’ with Others During COVID-19: Positivity Resonance Mediates Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Links between Trait Resilience and Mental Health","Shared positive emotions involving caring and synchrony—termed “positivity resonance”—are associated with mental health (Major et al., 2018). We hypothesized that, during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual differences in trait resilience would be linked with better overall mental health in part because those higher in trait resilience experience more positivity resonance. We surveyed respondents nationally in April and May of 2020 (total N = 1,059), during pervasive stay-at-home orders. Participants completed self-reports of trait resilience and mental health and used the Day Reconstruction Method to describe their social and emotional experiences. Structural equation models showed positivity resonance to mediate the links between trait resilience and mental health outcomes. Subsequent analyses showed these mediating effects to be independent of overall positive emotion and social interaction quantity (amongst nationwide adults). These results indicate that high-quality social connection played a uniquely important role in maintaining mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Michael Prinzing et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46143-5DF-0F7","20200817","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; broaden-and-build theory; social interaction; affective science; positive psychology; well-being","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Multiple activities change intervention as a vehicle for changing the mental health narrative and practice","A novel intervention named multiple activities change intervention or MACI has been discussed. On 28th July 08 a 33 old male presented with history of stress, worry, and anxiety since childhood, backache since 2002, inadequate sleep, headache and body ache, acidity and abdominal discomfort, and throat discomfort – all from 2002. Results with multiple activities change intervention (MACI): baseline BDI-II score 41, 4 days later 11, and 19 days later 5. No psycho-pharmaceuticals were used. No interpretation regarding the symptoms was offered. Unfortunately, this man did not come for follow up. But there were others whom I have followed up for longer periods, and I have reported three such cases of drug resistant depression, who were utterly hopeless but showed a sharp improvement with MACI. In common mental illnesses (depression and anxiety, alcohol and tobacco use), such sharp improvements are often observed with MACI. Not so sharp but consistent improvements occurred in some other instances. As a social tool MACI has the potential to change the discourse in the field of health—and this is equally true for mental health.","Atul Agarwal","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-821-79A","20200819","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Social isolation, mental health, and use of digital interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative survey","Summary Background: Public health measures to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates may have negative psychosocial consequences in youth. Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We investigated the associations between social isolation, cognitive preoccupation, worries, and anxiety, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as use of, and attitude towards, mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the ‘Mental Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey’ —a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Outcomes: Overall, 38% of youth met criteria for moderate psychological distress and 30% felt ‘often’ or ‘very often’ socially isolated, even after most restrictive infection control measures had been lifted. Social isolation, COVID-19-related worries and anxiety, and objective risk indicators were associated with psychological distress, with evidence of dose-response relationships for some of these associations. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of social isolation increased (reporting ‘never’ as reference group: ‘occasionally’: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 9·1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4·3 – 19·1, p<0·001; ‘often’: aOR 22·2, CI 9·8 – 50·2, p<0·001;’very often’: aOR 42·3, CI 14·1 – 126·8, p<0·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas high levels of psychological distress, worries, and anxiety were associated with actual use. Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with poor mental health in youth. Digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact given there is an objective need and subjective demand.","Christian Rauschenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; social isolation; public mental health; youth mental health; mhealth; social risk; worrying; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences and somatic symptoms","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, populations from many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidenced deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was unidirectional since daytime reports of negative mental experiences were not associated with poor sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement","Peter Simor et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-9FB-D9D","20200807","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; coronavirus; psychotic-like; somatic symptoms; sleep; rumination; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an International Sample: Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and the Role of Fatalism","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency affecting millions of people and their mental health. We aimed to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the COVID-19 outbreak in an international sample and to explore the role of fatalism in behavior modification and psychological distress. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, the impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, pandemic-related stress, as well as fatalism. Traumatic impact of the pandemic was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The sample included 465 participants from 30 different countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 – 76; 80% female). Study participants were significantly affected by the pandemic. While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe traumatic impact of the pandemic. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with a lack of behavior modification in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect the mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our findings also indicate that public health interventions should take into account the negative impact of fatalism on behavior modification.","Olga Bogolyubova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D","20200818","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; traumatic stress; mental health; covid-19; coronavirus; ptss; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Measuring COVID-19 Fear in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS-related fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Ho et al. (2005) in their original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear of Infection, and Existential Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress, subjective wellbeing, and religiosity. Differences in the performance of the Fear of Infection and Existential Threat scales are considered in terms of the respective objective and subjective nature of the constructs.","Francesca Eileen Collins","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C","20200706","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; international students; australia; nepal; india; australian; university students; mental health; covid-19; contagion-related fear; scale validation; covid-19-related fear; nepali; fear; indian","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"From ‘It has stopped our lives’ to ‘Spending more time together has strengthened bonds': The varied experiences of Australian families during COVID-19","The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8th and April 28th, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including: 'Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion'; 'Families are missing the things that keep them healthy'; 'Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy'; 'The unprecedented demands of parenthood'; 'The unequal burden of COVID-19'; and 'Holding on to positivity'. Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude and tolerance.","Subhadra Evans et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5","20200817","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; qualitative; social restrictions; covid-19; australia; family relationships","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Impact of COVID-19 on Mental Health in India","The emergence of novel CoronaVirus Disease (COVID-19) has crossed borders at a lightening speed, infecting people all over the world within China and all over the globe. This virus has impacted in a way that has imposed mandatory lockdowns in many countries including India. However, since the lockdown has been imposed, attention is being focussed on the economic repercussions, migrants and livelihoods. Mental health issues such as anxiety, worry, fear of infection, sleep disturbance and in some cases suicide are side lined. This paper reviews the current scenario of COVID-19 in India in the context of mental health and related issues. Alongside, looks at ways to build awareness among the public on mental health during COVID-19.","Anjali Kanojia","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46065-402-1AC","20200816","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Concepts and Categories; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Death, Dying, and Grieving; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; india; prevention; lockdown; women; anxiety; mental health; psychological intervention; covid-19; children","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Digital phenotyping of complex psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. A large scale study on psychological reactions to the pandemic to inform ongoing population-level symptom tracking and response to treatment is currently lacking. Methods: Average intake scores for standard depression and anxiety symptom scales were tracked from January 1, 2017 to June 9, 2020 for patients seeking treatment from a digital mental health service to gauge the relationship between COVID-19 and self-reported symptoms. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to unstructured therapy transcript data from patients seeking treatment during the height of the pandemic in the United States between March 1, 2020 and June 9, 2020 to identify words associated with COVID-19 mentions. This analysis was used to identify symptoms that were present beyond those assessed by standard depression and anxiety measures. Results: Depression and anxiety symptoms reported by 169,889 patients between January 1, 2017 and June 9, 2020 were identified. There was no detectable change in intake depression symptom scores. Intake anxiety symptom scores increased 1.42 scale points [95% CI: 1.18, 1.65] between March 15, 2020 and April 1, 2020, when scores peaked. In the transcript data of these 169,889 patients, plus an expanded sample of 49,267 patients without symptom reports, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) identified 2,377 positively correlated and 661 negatively correlated terms that were significantly (FDR<.01) associated with mentions of the virus. These terms were classifiable into 24 symptoms beyond those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased intake anxiety symptoms for individuals seeking digital mental health treatment. NLP analyses suggest that standard symptom scales for depression and anxiety alone are inadequate to fully assess and track psychological reactions to the pandemic. Symptoms of grief, trauma, obsession-compulsion, agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, panic, and non- suicidal self-injury should be monitored as part of a new COVID-19 Syndrome category.","Thomas Hull et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-7D5-3B8","20200813","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"FreeSurfer based segmentation of hippocampal subfields: a review of methods and applications, with a novel quality control procedure for ENIGMA studies and other collaborative efforts","Structural hippocampal abnormalities are common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, and even variation within the normal range is related to cognitive performance and other complex phenotypes such as stress sensitivity. Hippocampal subregions are increasingly studied, as automated algorithms have become available for mapping and volume quantification. In the context of the ENIGMA Consortium, several Disease Working Groups are using the FreeSurfer software to analyze hippocampal subregion (subfield) volumes in patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other conditions, along with data from matched controls. In this overview, we explain the algorithm’s principle, summarize measurement reliability studies, and demonstrate two additional aspects (subfield autocorrelation and volume/reliability correlation) with illustrative data. We then explain the rationale for a standardized hippocampal subfield segmentation quality control (QC) procedure for improved pipeline harmonization. To guide researchers to make optimal use of the algorithm, we discuss how global size and age effects can be modelled, how QC steps can be incorporated and how subfields may be aggregated into composite volumes. This discussion is based on a synopsis of 162 published neuroimaging studies (01/2013–12/2019) that applied the FreeSurfer hippocampal subfield segmentation in a broad range of domains including cognition and healthy aging, brain development and neurodegeneration, affective disorders, schizophrenia, childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, inflammatory and systemic disease, alcoholism, stress regulation, neurotoxicity, as well as assessments of heritability, effects of candidate genes, genome-wide association studies and epigenetic effects. Lastly, we highlight points where FreeSurfer-based hippocampal subfield studies may be optimized.","Philipp Gerog Sämann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600B-CFB-F5C","20200811","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; hippocampus; enigma; hippocampal subregions; quality control; freesurfer; hippocampal subfields; mri; segmentation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Early life adversity, dispositional mindfulness, and longitudinal stress experience during the COVID-19 pandemic","Experiencing severe or prolonged stressors in early life is associated with increased risk for mental and physical disorders in adulthood. Further, individuals who experienced early life stress (ELS) may use dysfunctional coping strategies like stress-related eating, in contrast to more beneficial stress buffering mechanisms e.g. based on mindfulness. Whether these mechanisms contribute to increased levels of perceived stress and symptoms of mental disorders in individuals with ELS in times of crisis is yet unclear. As part of a larger project, we assessed changes in perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms in a sample of N=102 participants (81% female; meanage=23.49, SDage= 7.11, range 18–62) from October/December 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) to April/June 2020 (after the German government introduced Covid-19 related restrictions). Additionally, we assessed ELS and dispositional mindfulness. Perceived stress and depression significantly increased while anxiety levels decreased. No significant change was observed for somatization. ELS and dispositional mindfulness were not associated with change scores, but with perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms at both assessments. The increase in perceived stress during the pandemic in a majority of participants demonstrates the impact of the pandemic in the general population.","Annika Benz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-FB9-288","20200806","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; longitudinal data; anxiety; mental health; covid-19; depression; early life stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress","Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of monitoring the mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents during this pandemic and targeting perceived stress and isolation in high-risk youth.","Ian Gotlib et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F","20200619","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; early life stress; perceived stress; covid-19; adolescence; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Temporal dynamics of COVID-19’s psychological impact in the Czech Republic: from the outbreak to the stabilization","This study presents the results of a screening focused on the psychological impact associated with the outbreak and further development of COVID-19 pandemic in the Czech population. The aim of the study was to investigate temporal dynamics of psychological impact in a longer period covering phases of the epidemic growth, culmination, decrease, and slow return to a normal lifestyle. The sample of 2716 respondents aged between 18 and 89 years participated in an online survey from March 18th to May 25th, 2020; part of them (typically seniors and others, who had not access to the internet) were assisted in entering the data by trained interviewers. The survey comprised questionnaires capturing emotional states, psychological disturbance, anxiety, and depression. The changes in the scores by time phase were studied for the whole sample and for gender and age groups. The results show that the threat of COVID-19 caused a significant increase in negative emotional experience and in the symptoms of psychological disturbance, anxiety, and depression in the Czech population in time of infection culmination, even when the spread of the pandemic was well controlled, and then a gradual decline over time. The data indicated that the pandemic situation had a more pronounced impact on women and younger adults. The study also showed that in situations of pandemic stress associated with isolation, when isolated people are interviewed about their mental state, their reports on negative experiencing might be significantly reduced compared to direct anonymous self-reports data entry.","Iva Stuchlikova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604E-F25-3D4","20200803","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Psychological Impact of Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic_PREPRINT","This study addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and examined factors exacerbating or mitigating the negative effects of lockdown. Results from a large multi-country online survey (N=8,229) showed average elevated levels of anxiety and depression (especially in the USA, UK, and Brazil), associated with feelings of low control and social isolation. Although social isolation increased with the duration of quarantine, it was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Other mitigating factors include adaptive but not maladaptive coping, and the perception and trust that one’s government is dealing with the outbreak. Taking individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of lockdown can be alleviated by maintaining frequent social contact, adaptive coping, and governmental actions which show capability, benevolence, and integrity in managing a public health crisis.","Valerie Van Mulukom et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C","20200722","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health; quarantine; lockdown; sense of control; psychological well-being; government; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Perceived stress and insomnia under the period of COVID-19: The mediating role of sense of security and the moderating role of family cohesion","Although perceived stress has been shown to play an important role in insomnia, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation. In particular, the outbreak of COVID-19 has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the physical and mental health of college students. The present study focused on Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined the mediating role of sense of security between perceived stress and insomnia and the moderating role of family cohesion. Chinese college students (N = 1,187) completed the measures of perceived stress, sense of security, insomnia, and family cohesion. The results indicated that perceived stress was significantly and positively associated with insomnia, and sense of security partially mediated this relation. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that family cohesion moderated the relation between perceived stress and sense of security. This relation became weaker for college students with higher levels of family cohesion. Results highlight the significance of identifying the mechanisms that moderate the mediate paths between perceived stress and college students’ insomnia.","Baojuan Ye et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46136-73E-BBC","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; sense of security; covid-19; insomnia; family cohesion; perceived stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Helplessness Among University Students: An Empirical Study Based on a Modified Framework of Implicit Personality Theories","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and within a very short period of time, teaching in the 2020 summer term changed from predominantly on-site to online instruction. Students suddenly faced having to adapt their learning process to new demands for which they may have had both insufficient digital skills and a lack of learning resources. Such a situation carries the risk that a substantial number of students become helpless. The aim of our empirical study was to test a hybrid framework of helplessness that includes both objective causes of helplessness and students' subjective interpretations of them. Before lectures or courses began, students of a full-scale university were invited to participate in an online survey. The final sample consists of 1,690 students. Results indicate that objective factors as well as their subjective interpretations contribute to the formation of helplessness.","Albert Ziegler et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F3-952-403","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learner","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Resilience contributes to low emotional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in Italy","Background The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences. The Italian Government has implemented a massive lockdown to decrease the spread of the virus. Although a strong psychological impact is possible, few evidences are still available. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress promoting mental health. For these reasons, this study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterizing by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. Methods A total sample of 6314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 10 and May 4 2020 through an online survey, the majority of whom from Northern Italy. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) (a measure of mental health status) and the Resilience Scale (RS) (a measure of resilience) were administered. Also, demographic data and lockdown related information were collected. DASS-21 cut-off scores were used to verify the mental status among the participants. Subsequently, a correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between DASS-21 and RS. Lastly, three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the three DASS-21 scales as dependent variables and the RS scales as independent variables controlling for age, gender, and education. Results The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 36.1% for depression, 28.7% for anxiety, and 35.6% for stress. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that all the resilience factors were statistically significant in predicting anxiety, while meaningfulness, perseverance, existential aloneness, and equanimity predicted depression and stress. Conclusions During the lockdown following the COVID-19 outbreak, about a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychological interventions to enhance resilience might provide useful approaches to overcome COVID-related emotional impact.","Vittorio Lenzo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-344-7DB","20200801","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; clinical psychology; depression; dass-21; resilience; anxiety; covid-19; stress; resilience scale","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COnVida-20(1)","An increasing number of studies have addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in the general population. Nevertheless, far less is known about the impact in specific populations such as university students, whose psychological vulnerability has been shown in previous research. This study sought to examine different indicators of mental health in university students during the Spanish lockdown; we also analyzed the main sources of stress perceived by students in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, and the coping strategies adopted when faced with the situation. Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact; and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially channeled the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that students’ psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress. This study reinforces the need to monitor and promote mental health in university students to boost resilience in times of crisis. Our results on effective coping strategies may inform preventive programs aimed at helping students to deal with challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Isabel Padrón et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-A5C-11A","20200731","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; psychological impact; coping; stressors; university students; convida-20.","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Depression symptoms mediate mismatch between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and diminished compliance with prevention measures","Without any known vaccine or cure, sustaining individuals’ cooperation in following prevention measures is crucial to prevent spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Here, we monitored national representative samples with changes in beliefs about the pandemic, depressive symptoms, and motivation to comply with prevention measures between the end of the first wave (Time1) and beginning of the second wave (Time2) of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Participants’ beliefs about the pandemic closely reflected the change of the COVID-19 situations. Strikingly, inconsistent with the accurate belief update, individuals regarded social distancing less important and externalized their motives to comply with preventive measures more at Time2 than Time1. This mismatch was mediated by depressive symptoms, such that increased depressive symptoms followed by negative belief change were associated with decreased perceived importance of social distancing and voluntary motivation. Our data highlights the importance of considering psychological reactions in promoting individuals’ compliance with prevention measures.","Jiwon Park et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974","20200729","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; depression; covid-19; belief; social distancing","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Factors Mediating the Psychological Well-Being of Healthcare Workers Responding to Global Pandemics: A Systematic Review","The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the likelihood of future pandemics has raised the attention to the effects of pandemics on the psychological well-being of individuals. Given their indispensable role in such situations, healthcare workers are at greater risk of mental health issues. This paper aimed to review the mediators of psychological well-being among healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. After registration on PROSPERO, a systematic review was performed in four databases. Following study selection (PRISMA guidelines), inclusion criteria and analysis methods were assessed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the EPHPP criteria. Out of 1467 references, 39 studies were included in this review. In most studies, worse well-being outcomes, such as stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout were related to demographic characteristics, direct contact with infected patients, and poor perceived support. In turn, self-efficacy, coping ability, altruism, and support from employers and organisations were found to be protective factors. Despite some limitations in the quality of the available evidence, this review highlights the prevalence of poor mental health outcomes in healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. Future interventions should target the identified mediators to promote psychological well-being among this population, particularly social and organisational support, which may improve workers’ mental health and reduce burnout and turnover.","Jekaterina Schneider et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-DBE-BD0","20200730","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; healthcare professionals; mediation; pandemic; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How communication technology helps mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individual and social wellbeing: Preliminary support for a compensatory social interaction model","The present study preliminary tested the compensatory social interaction model for individuals experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. This original model comprises two distinct processes: expression of online emotions leads to post-traumatic growth, which can favor positive mental health and prosocial behaviors; and receiving online social support leads to increases in positive mental health, which can also favor prosocial behaviors. Adults living in Italy (n=1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed that being more involved in expression of online emotions was associated with higher post-traumatic growth that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, participants who perceived higher online social support were more likely to report higher positive mental health that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two social interaction processes suggest that communication technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the Covid-19 pandemic.","Natale Canale et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This study aimed to explore the related factors of nutrition, physical activity (PA), and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety, and to investigate associations between the two lifestyle behaviors (insolated or combined) with symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Cross-sectional data of 1,756 middle school students from a survey conducted in May 2020 was used. The t-tests or c2 tests were used to determine the related factors of nutrition, PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety across the subgroups when appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between nutrition and PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Girls, rural students, left-behind, sibling, students with low family income or excessive fear had worse lifestyle or mental status. Both poor nutrition and inactive PA were related to higher odds of reporting symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Students with both poor nutrition and inactive PA tended to report insomnia symptoms (OR = 2.16) and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.57) than those with only one behavior or neither of them after controlling for confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of helping adolescents to pursue a healthier lifestyle.","Xinli Chi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-373-450","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Polygenic Risk Score for Smoking is associated with Externalizing Psychopathology and Disinhibited Personality Traits but not Internalizing Psychopathology in Adolescence","Importance: Large consortia of genome wide association studies have yielded more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate the small effects of many genetic variants to characterize the genetic architecture of disorders and provide a personalized measure of genetic risk. Objective: We examined whether a PRS for smoking measured genetic risk for general behavioral disinhibition by estimating its associations with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and related personality traits. We examined these associations at multiple time points in adolescence using more refined phenotypes defined by stable characteristics across time and at young ages, which reduced potential confounds associated with cumulative exposure to substances and reverse causality. Methods: Random intercept panel models were fit to symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems and personality traits at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old in the Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 3225). Results: The smoking PRS had strong associations with the random intercept factors for all the externalizing measures (mean standardized <U+A7B5> = .27), agreeableness (<U+A7B5>=-.22, 95% CI: -.28, -.16), and conscientiousness (<U+A7B5>=-.19, 95% CI: -.24, -.13), but was not significantly associated with the internalizing measures (mean <U+A7B5> = .06) or extraversion (<U+A7B5>=.01, 95% CI: -.05, .07). After controlling for smoking at age 17, the associations with the externalizing measures (mean <U+A7B5> = .13) and personality traits related to behavioral control (mean <U+A7B5> = -.10) remained statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The smoking PRS measures genetic influences that contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition including externalizing psychopathology and normal-range personality traits related to behavioral control, but not internalizing psychopathology. Continuing to identify the correlates and delineate the mechanisms of the genetic influences associated with disinhibition could have substantial impact in mitigating a variety of public health problems (e.g., mental health, academic achievement, criminality).","Brian M.

"Psychological distress and adaptation to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States","Objective There is growing concern that the COVID-19 crisis may have long-standing mental health effects across society particularly amongst those with pre-existing mental health conditions. In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. Methods We analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from eight waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and July 20th, 2020 (N = 7319 Observations = 46145). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Results On average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p<.001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US. Distress levels subsequently declined to mid-March levels by June, 2020 (d =-.31, 95% CI [-0.34,-0.27], p<.001). Across the sociodemographic groups examined and those with pre-existing mental health conditions we observed a sharp rise in distress followed by a recovery to baseline distress levels. Conclusions This study identified substantial increases in distress in the US during the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis that largely diminished in the weeks that followed and suggests that population level resilience in mental health may be occurring in response to the pandemic.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717","20200721","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; longitudinal research; adaptation; mental health; resilience; psychological distress; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Nature, Cause and Consequence of COVID-19 Panic among Social Media Users in India","Aims The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has not only shaken the healthcare but also economic structure around the world. In addition to these direct effects, it has also brought in some indirect difficulties owing to the information epidemic on social media. As India experienced a later outbreak of COVID-19 and a prolonged uninterrupted lockdown, we aimed to understand the nature of panic social media users in India are experiencing due to the flow of (mis)information. We further extend this investigation to other countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study by conducting survey on multiple social media platforms. We received 1075 responses (sex ratio 2:1) through opportunity sampling from social media users of 30 different countries (between April 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020). We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses on the 935 respondents from India. Several hypotheses are statistically tested on them and are further examined on rest of the 140 social media users from 29 other countries. We also performed a separate Twitter hashtag analysis and sentiment analysis on the responses. We applied a citizen science approach to involve the respondents in the analysis pipeline after the survey. Results This cross-sectional study on 1075 social media users from India and 29 other countries revealed a significant increase of social media usage and rise of panic over time in India. Middle-aged people and female exhibit a higher panic in India. The amount of panic was independent of the nature of association with COVID-19. The change of mental health was associated with panic level and productivity. Further qualitative analysis highlights the occurrences of information panic, economic panic, moral panic and spiritual panic, among other causes. Conclusions Several panic behaviors are unique to social media users in India possibly because COVID-19 broke out relatively later in comparison with the other countries and the uninterrupted lockdown prolonged for a long time. The amount of social media usage might not be causal but has a significant role in generating panic among the people in India. A significantly higher level of panic among the middle-aged people can be attributed to their higher amount of responsibility. The popularity of different hashtags, including the names of drugs under trial for COVID-19, in limited countries highlight that the causes of panic are not the same everywhere. As some of the respondents took part as citizen scientists a robust perspective to the outcome is obtained.","Chandrima Bhattacharya et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-9EA-D12","20200727","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; social media; covid-19; anxiety; panic","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19: an observational study","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective: We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a “guns” semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress”, “isolation”, and “home” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (<U+03C1> = -0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.","Daniel Mark Low et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1","20200713","PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Bipolar and Related Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; suicidality; eating disorders; machine learning; reddit; mental health; adhd; natural language processing; health anxiety; nlp; psychiatry; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Validation of the French Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its Associations with Depression, Anxiety and Differential Emotions","Abstract The COVID-19 crisis represents a global health concern, including mental health. Regarding the necessity to assess anxiety related to COVID-19, a scale was developed (Ahorsu et al., 2020). The goal of the present study was to validate of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in French (official language in 29 countries), and investigate its relationship with indicators of affective disturbances. The study was performed on 316 participants. The FCV-19S underwent a double back translation procedure. Its psychometric properties were evaluated. The French FCV-19S demonstrated a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties (strong internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, and good test- retest validity). With its robust psychometric properties in assessing the unidimensional construct of the fear of COVID-19, this scale will help to provide a better understanding of the relationship between emotions and psychological or psychiatric disorders during the pandemics in French-speaking countries.","Arnaud Carre et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-444-F07","20200721","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; fear; french validation; fear of covid-19 scale; scale development; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review","Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. Decision-makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs in times of quarantine and social distancing.","Christian Rauschenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; covid-19; mental health promotion; mhealth; intervention; ehealth; digital psychiatry; prevention; telemedicine","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Poor quality of sleep and its consequences on mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seriously affected all Italy. The extreme virulence, the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. Methods Through an internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole COVID-19 lockdown (from 10thMarch – 1st phase - to 4th May – 2nd phase). We investigated the socio-demographic and COVID-19 related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study - sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales – 21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. Results 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers reveal several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died due to COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythm characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, extremely severe levels of stress, of anxiety, and of depression. Conclusions This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole lockdown in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population have had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be taken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 health emergency.","Christian Franceschini et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46228-DDF-9E6","20200725","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Sleep-wake Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; sleep quality; depression; anxiety; italian lockdown; risk factor; covid-19; sleep habits; clinical psychology; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Self-compassion buffers the adverse mental health impacts of COVID-19-related threats: Results from a cross-sectional survey at the first peak of Hong Kong’s outbreak","COVID-19 has brought tremendous and abrupt threats to various aspects of our daily lives, from school and work to interpersonal relationships. Self-compassion is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people’s resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.","Bobo Hi Po Lau et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829","20200723","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; self-coldness; mental health; hong kong; anxiety; covid-19; depression; self-compassion","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic in the Polish population","Background: The level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed. Risk factors for mental health in the Polish population have been identified. Methods: The 926 respondents completed a set of questionnaires consisting of questions concerning COVID-19, PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R) and their mental health status (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21). Results: Most respondents reported severe PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (44.06%), normal intensity of depressive symptoms (52.38%), anxiety symptoms (56.05%) and stress (56.48%). Female gender, parental status, having a relationship, at least a two-person household are associated with higher PTSS and DASS-21 subscale. A few physical symptoms, a medical visit, quarantine, negative health evaluation, and chronic diseases, knowledge of the increase in the number of infected people and the number of deaths are associated with higher levels of PTSS. Some of the precautions and the need for additional information on COVID-10, the certainty of a high probability of contracting COVID-19, a low survival rate and concerns about loved ones are associated with higher PTSS.

"Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS)","Abstract Parenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on children’s socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage children’s social and emotional needs, structure children’s activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.","Rebecca Waller et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3","20200714","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; covid-19; family; children; dads; childhood; parents; moms; home environment; parenting; parent-child relationships; parenting practices; adolescence","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"High Work-related Stress and Anxiety Response to COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in South Korea: SAVE study","Background: We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. Methods: Participants for this study comprised 1,783 healthcare workers drawn from two hospitals inKorea. We adopted a cross-sectional online survey design and used an anonymous questionnaire from 20-30 April 2020, with information on demographics, psychiatric history, Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared to other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression, general anxiety, and virus-related anxiety symptoms (p < 0.01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 = 10) than married workers (20.3% vs 14.1%; p < 0.01), and junior (< 40 years old) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis adjusted with age, sex, and work duration identified three factors as significantly associated with healthcare worker's depression (PHQ-9 = 10): being a nursing professional (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 – 1.98), single (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.83), and higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15 – 1.22).

"Development and validation of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS)","During respiratory viral epidemics and pandemics such as the COVD-19 pandemic, everyday behaviors such as leaving the house and touching frequently-used surfaces become the subject of fear and avoidance due to their potential for contagion. Despite the potential mental health related impact of this psychological phenomenon, there are currently no measures available that are designed to evaluate the extent to which individuals become fearful of these everyday situations during a respiratory viral pandemic. Here, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS) questionnaire across two samples recruited online (ns = 243, 341) recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the ARVIS is best described by a single factor and shows a high reliability (Chronbach’s alpha > .88). It showed convergent associations with state anxiety and low discriminant associations with general trait anxiety and depression. Moreover, the ARVIS was highly associated with the extent to which subjects reported engaging in handwashing and social distancing, demonstrating criterion validity. This new scale provides a validated measure for assessing virus-related fear that can facilitate research into the psychological effects of respiratory virus pandemics.","Toby Wise et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; pandemic; fear; infection; avoidance; anxiety; covid","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Multilevel Associations of Daily Skill Use and Effectiveness With Anxiety, Stress, and Depression in a Transdiagnostic Sample Undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is relatively effective at treating disorders of emotion dysregulation. However, given researchers’ focus on group-level differences within disorder-specific treatments, it is unclear which transdiagnostic mechanisms influence these effects. Participants (n=19, Mage=31.8, 68% female, 95% Caucasian) with elevated emotion dysregulation completed daily reports of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a DBT skills training group (1,344 observations). We tested whether within-person skill use was associated with same-day negative affect, predicted next-day changes in negative affect, and was moderated by perceived emotion regulation effectiveness. Participants used more within-person skills on days of greater stress and anxiety, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety. On days of high, but not low, perceived effectiveness, people used more skills in response to more intense negative affect. The use, and perceived effectiveness, of more skills may be mechanisms by which DBT skills groups promote improved emotional functioning.","Matthew W.

"A Person-Centered Approach to Profiling COVID-Related Experiences in the United States: Preliminary Findings from the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities around the world. Intensive health precautions have created constraints on mobility, work, education, family life, and interpersonal relationships. Preliminary survey studies have reported an increase in the prevalence and severity of psychosocial impairments in the pandemic’s immediate wake. However, the impact of specific pandemic-related experiences and patterns of experiences has not been systematically assessed and studied. The goal of the present study was to develop and conduct a preliminary empirical test of a novel, comprehensive assessment of pandemic-related experiences, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), using person-centered latent class analysis (LCA). Aims were to (1) test the hypothesis that LCA would identify unique subgroups based on patterns of negative and positive pandemic-related experiences across personal and social domains, and (2) examine whether identified subgroups would significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health and functioning. Results supported hypotheses, with several unique subgroups identified across domains that were differentiated on sociodemographic characteristics and measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and perceived social support. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This study, combined with future research with the EPII, may serve to inform public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the current pandemic and under similar mass public health crisis circumstances in the future.","Damion Grasso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707","20200701","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; pandemic; covid-19; epidemic; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The quality of research on mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review","Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This systematic review aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open science practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases on the 13th of May. Empirical studies, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, between February and May 2020, were included. The dependent variable(s) required to be quantitative and related to mental health. Exclusion criteria included clinical pharmacological trials, and studies using psychophysiological or biological recordings. The study protocol was previously pre-registered in https://osf.io/bk3gw/. Findings: Twenty-eight studies were identified. More than 75% met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, 89.3% used convenience samples and 92.86% lacked of a priori power analysis. There was low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies (0%) and availability of databases (3.57%), which raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Interpretation: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good science.","Ines Nieto et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7","20200714","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; mental health; research quality; covid-19; systematic review","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How handling extreme C-reactive protein (CRP) values influences CRP and depression symptom networks: A replication and extension of Fried et al (2019)","Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all other variables modeled. However, these analyses require a lot of power and replication is key to determine their utility in this context. Additionally, further investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. The current study attempts to replicate Fried et al. (2019), which found CRP to be uniquely associated with sleep problems, fatigue, and changes in appetite. In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite, no support for an association between CRP and sleep, and some support for additional CRP—symptom associations. Methodologically, results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP > 10 mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Implications for the characterization of an inflammatory phenotype of depression, treatment planning, and designing future studies are discussed.","Daniel Moriarity et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46061-1B6-99B","20200712","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; depression; network; immunology; inflammation; replication; phenotype; network analysis; nhanes","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Depression symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions in Germany","Since the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Germany, various lockdown measures were imposed across the country that likely had a large impact on psychological well-being. In the current study, we investigate depressive symptoms as depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease and potentially life-threatening. This study reports on a dataset that was collected between April 8 and June 1 2020 through an online survey in several German states. More than 2000 individuals took part in the survey measuring depressive symptoms (as defined in ICD-10). Similar to recent observations from Italy and China, severe depressive symptoms reported were relatively high. Especially younger adults and females reported more severe symptoms compared to other groups. In conclusion, we need to prepare for increased need of psychological services, availability and accessibility already parallel with imposing restrictive measures.","Iris Schelhorn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46204-E18-EC0","20200713","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; covid-19; depression; online survey","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Evidence for Differential Susceptibility","The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents’ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.","Jonas G.

"Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden","New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health; employment","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-D39-1F2","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; psychological morbidities; public health; mental health; coping strategies; primary prevention","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Resilience During Uncertainty Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue","Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.","Jonas P.

"The Bittersweet Dynamics of Psychological Distress and Relief During New Zealand’s COVID-19 Lockdown Clarify Avoidable Mental Health Burdens","Research indicates COVID-19 lockdowns elevated psychological distress. Here, we leverage national panel data before and during New Zealand’s COVID-19 lockdown to clarify distress buffers (2018/2020, N = 940). To distinguish lockdown-related distress from natural disasters, we investigate distress dynamics following the Christchurch earthquakes (2011, N = 6,806). During lockdown, there were small increases in hopelessness, restlessness, and nervousness, and substantial increases in worthlessness. A sense of neighbourhood community became decoupled from this distress, which high levels of social belonging and health satisfaction did not prevent. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort fostered by social belonging. By contrast, the Christchurch earthquakes increased all distress indicators and distress buffers performed consistently. We infer that losses of employment and social routines during New Zealand’s lockdown, in a setting of government income and health protections, precipitated bittersweet mental health dynamics. That certain pandemic mental health burdens are avoidable has applied interest.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-880-A11","20200626","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; wellbeing; social capital; ordinal; worthlessness; employment; lockdown; bayesian; anxiety; routine; kessler-6; buffer","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling). Supporting this idea, two studies using data from the U.K. (cross-sectional) and the U.S. (longitudinal) show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors in the past as well as in the future.","Max Hui Bai","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22","20200702","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences","Intro: When confronted with major threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people often experience (temporary) decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying stability and change of well-being in times of threat like the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined change in mental health symptoms and its relationships with appraisals of the pandemic and daily life experiences during the pandemic, including affective states, stress, and mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. In this report, we worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as a total of 7189 observations from the diary phase. Results: Results showed that less fortunate change in mental health symptoms across three weeks was predicted by more negative affect and less mindfulness, specifically less attention to the present moment, in daily life. Furthermore, less fortunate change in mental health symptoms was correlated with change towards less fortunate appraisals of the appraisals. Finally, we showed that more general views of the pandemic (i.e., appraisals) were interrelated to experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and they show how experiences in daily life matter for change in well-being","Annette Brose et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; ambulatory assessment; affect; well-being; mindfulness; mental health; stress; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.","Ruth Neill et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF","20200701","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; depression; media consumption; covid-19; anxiety; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","Mokhlesur Rahman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity","Background. Previous studies carried out in different countries indicated that young adults experience higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which epidemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose. The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, as well as perceived difficulties related to pandemic across four age groups in the Polish population; (ii) which factors and difficulties related to pandemic are predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method. A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The group was a representative sample of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed online: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, Social Support Sale, Scale of Epidemic-Related Difficulties. Results. Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Difficulties in relationships and at home were amongst the strongest predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus were one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18-29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms only in the youngest group. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members were the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, it is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malgorzata Gambin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Old Age; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19 outbreak; lockdown; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; epidemic-related difficulties","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Loneliness in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional results from The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study","Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 – 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms. Improving emotion regulation and sleep quality may be optimal initial targets to reduce the impact of COVID-19 regulations on mental health outcomes.","Jenny Groarke et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E","20200624","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; public health; mental health; covid-19; prevalence; risk factors; cross-sectional studies; protective factors; loneliness; emotion regulation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Environmental reward and self-medication theories suggest that increased distress and greater social/environmental constraints during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to clarify the presence and direction of changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 1127) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in an online survey. The survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes (alcohol use; drinking motives; alcohol demand, and solitary drinking). Outcomes were assessed for two timeframes: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (‘pre-social-distancing’), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (‘post-social-distancing’). Depression severity, coping motives, and frequency of solitary drinking were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Time spent drinking and frequency of binge drinking were greater post-social-distancing compared to pre-social-distancing, whereas typical alcohol quantity/frequency were not significantly different between timeframes. Indices of alcohol demand were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effects of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Results provide early evidence regarding the relation of psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study","Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched case–control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. Conclusion: These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.","Abu Sayeed et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-9CC-022","20200617","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; covid-19; comorbidity; bangladesh; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review","The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.","Jenna Sung et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801","20200618","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Neurotic coronavirus generation? The report from the second wave of research on the students from Kraków","The report presents the results of the second wave of research conducted among the students of the Pedagogical University of Kraków. The research method was an on-line survey (CAWI) on the sample of 1927 respondents. The comparison of responses from both surveys indicates that the change in attitudes and mental condition of the respondents occurred. After almost three months of quarantine the youth is less interested in the pandemic, has lower fear of the coronavirus, evaluates the actions taken by government to combat the pandemic worse. A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education. Mental tiredness, decreased efficiency of actions and a decrease in motivation for learning are observed as well.","Piotr Dlugosz","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-E0E-2A3","20200617","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; fear; youth; covid-19; poland; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Well-Being and COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beings’ livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship between people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Method: 222 participants (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of well-being and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. Results: The results showed that people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants’ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: People’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and people’s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety, as well as finding ways to alleviate people’s COVID-19 anxiety.","Zhuojun Wang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612E-F41-854","20200615","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; china; longitudinal design; well-being; cross-lagged analysis; covid-19 anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Therapeutic alliance, social inclusion and infection control - Towards pandemic-adapted mental health care services in Switzerland","The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the Swiss mental health care system. Many services were downsized or closed and admission to treatment and care institutions was restricted. While these measures were necessary according to the general containment and mitigation strategies of federal and cantonal authorities, this situation has had negative consequences for care and treatment of service users. This paper asks to re-think key aspects of the Swiss mental health care system that have demonstrated to be not adaptable to the pandemic. In particular, the paper suggests diversifying care and treatment settings and strengthening outpatient and outreach services. Finally, some proposals to foster social inclusion during and after the pandemic are outlined.","Dirk Richter et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-DE5-951","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; switzerland; mental health services; pandemic; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46214-0AD-065","20200614","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; mental health; public; mental morbidities; primary prevention; keywords: mental health; psychological morbidities; coping strategies; health information; health promotion","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain","The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales. On the other hand, daily physical activity was found to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Results indicate that people with social anxiety might be especially vulnerable to the development of other mental disorders after the relaxation of the confinement measures.","Álvaro Planchuelo-Gómez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-16D-42D","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depression; covid-19; longitudinal; anxiety; posttraumatic stress disorder; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Perceived Risk and Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Resilience and Coronavirus Fear","During coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were particularly at high-risk of developing symptoms of mental health problems due to being on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19. This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as critical mechanism that explain the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.","Murat Yildirim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19 perceived risk; covid-19; resilience; mental health problems; healthcare professionals; covid-19 fear","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention","The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001). On average, differences in their perceived ability to handle lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic were positive, but small and at the level of a nonsignificant trend (dav=0.13, dz=0.14, p=0.066).

"Mood Symptoms Predict COVID-19 Pandemic Distress but not Vice Versa: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale and was argued to have negatively impacted the population’s mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These find-ings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Benjamin A Katz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-A9E-78B","20200611","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; psychological stress; equivalence testing; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology","Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.","Asle Hoffart et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277","20200610","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID Feel Good – An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus","Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.","Giuseppe Riva et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Human-animal relationships and interactions during the Covid-19 lockdown phase in the UK: investigating links with mental health and loneliness","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic raises questions about the role that relationships and interactions between humans and animals play in the context of widespread social distancing and isolation measures. We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. Results: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. Conclusion: The human-animal bond is a construct of potential clinical importance to identify mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Animal ownership appeared to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required.","Elena Ratschen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9","20200803","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; social distancing &amp; mental health; isolation; covid-19; human-animal bond; human-animal interaction","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Digital screen time during COVID-19 pandemic: A public health concern","The use of digital screens, including television, computers, mobile phones, and smart devices, can be associated with a wide range of health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, different population groups may have been adapted to varying levels of screen time, which may have profound implications on their health and wellbeing. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals. Such interventions may address not only unhealthy screen use behavior but also promote active lifestyles that may improve health across populations during and after this pandemic.","Abida Sultana et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46184-928-6EC","20200901","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Child Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; covid-19; screen use; screen time; health promotion; coronavirus","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Gender differences in the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on unpaid care work and psychological distress in the UK","School and nursery closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, particularly for parents. Amongst contemporary couples in the UK, women spent more time than men doing housework, childcare and caring for adults prior to the crisis; thus, lockdown draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. This study aims to answer how couples in the UK divided childcare and housework during lockdown and whether this is associated with changes in levels of psychological distress. Data for this study come from the April and May waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ score (ranges from 0 to 36). Unpaid care work included men and women’s hours spent on childcare and housework and the impact of increased unpaid care work on employment schedules. We found that every week, women spent 5 more hours on housework and 10 more hours on childcare than men during lockdown, and this increased housework and childcare was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for women. One-third of parents adapted their work patterns because of childcare/ homeschooling. Men and women who adapted their work patterns had on average 1.16 and 1.39 higher GHQ scores than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Only 10% of fathers reduced work hours due to care work compared to 20% of mothers. Fathers had more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. Our research suggests that lockdown has hit people with young families and lone mothers particularly hard in terms of mental health, and continued gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work during lockdown may be putting women at a greater risk of psychological distress.","Baowen Xue et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11","20200821","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; mental health; covid; lone mothers; domestic work; gender inequality; divisions of unpaid care","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Disequilibrium and COVID-19: Effectively Applying Crisis Intervention","Crisis intervention is widely understood as a response to life-threatening emergencies and therefore often limited in its application to natural disasters, severe physical violence, suicidal ideation, and similarly dangerous incidents. While crisis intervention is appropriate for these scenarios, historical definitions of crisis suggest the term and related interventions have much broader application. The ramifications of the novel coronavirus and related cultural fallout increase vulnerability and impair coping capacity in such a way that individuals are significantly more likely to enter crisis states, demanding a prompt reconsideration of the breadth of this practice technique. Successful application of crisis intervention reduces the long-term psychological implications for individuals encountering sudden loss, unexpected traumas, and other hazards that overwhelm traditional coping strategies, outcomes all made more likely by this pandemic. Crisis intervention is a structured, time-limited, problem-oriented treatment modality that is well suited to a remote practice environment because it is directive in its approach and requires few contacts at a time when client access is potentially limited. This paper examines the course of crisis with or without intervention, assessment and intervention tactics, social work values when applying crisis intervention, and the implications of the use of this modality as it relates to COVID-19.","Stephen Oby","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-7FB-5A9","20200817","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; crisis intervention; coping; crisis; covid-19; disequilibrium; coronavirus","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The COVID-19 Coping Study: A longitudinal mixed-methods study of mental health and well-being among older US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To describe the methodology and baseline cohort characteristics of the COVID-19 Coping Study, a longitudinal mixed-methods study of US adults aged =55. Methods Participants were recruited through online multi-frame non-probability sampling in April and May, 2020. The baseline questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on daily life and mental health. Monthly follow-ups will be conducted for one year. Findings In total, 6,938 adults participated across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (mean [SD] age: 67.3 [7.9]; 64% female). Two in three adults reported leaving home only for essential purposes in the past week (population-weighted proportion: 69%; 95% CI: 68%-71%). One-quarter of older adults in work before the pandemic reported reduced work hours or income (25%; 95% CI: 22%-27%). One in three screened positive for depression (32%; 95% CI: 30%-34%) and anxiety (29%; 95% CI: 28%-31%).

"Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of COVID-19: A Classification Scheme","Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear.” Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we compare perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence) for each group, and find a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups. Our findings inform what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.","Reka Solymosi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862","20200808","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; risk; wellbeing; worry; covid-19; precautions; re-engagement","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Lifestyle and Mental Health Disruptions During COVID-19","COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the pandemic (N=685), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 9,400 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by about 25-30 minutes per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 minutes, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 hours per day. The proportion of participants at risk of clinical depression increases to 65%, over twice the rate in the same population prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic. However, restoration of those habits--either naturally or through policy intervention--has limited impact on restoring mental well-being.","Giovanni Giuntella et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46013-408-4CF","20200804","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; covid-19; higher education; depression; sleep; physical activity; health; mental health","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Maintaining contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with positive mental health","There is growing evidence that exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) has potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.","Sarai Pouso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD","20200804","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; nature’s contributions to people; depression; ecosystem services; anxiety; green-blue infrastructure","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Social capital and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health and wellbeing across populations. The continued burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations. The existing forms of social capital may provide social support within and between communities that are critically affected by COVID-19. Alongside faster recovery from socioeconomic challenges, social capital interventions may strengthen the social determinants of mental health and empower communities to alleviate the psychosocial consequences of this pandemic.","Tahmina Tasnim Rodela et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166","20200728","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology; mental health; coronavirus; psychosocial interventions; covid-19; social capital; mental disorders","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work","The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers. Early estimates of responses to the COVID19 pandemic offer insights into future implications of telecommuting for gender equality at work.","Thomas Lyttelton et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7","20200709","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; gender; housework; care work; covid; inequality; telecommuting; wellbeing; time use; covid-19; work; household labor; working from home","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.","Bruno Arpino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3","20200707","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; physical distancing; mental health; social relationships; coronavirus; sars-cov-2; consequences of covid-19; covid-19","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean","Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure. The landscape of historic hurricane exposure Caribbean has radically changed in recent years. Taking advantage of Big Data to help elucidate these dynamics could be instrumental in the tailoring of emergency preparedness plans and the effective design of mental health first aid strategies.","Danilo T Perez-Rivera et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-651-F28","20200630","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology; national hurricane center; karen; dorian; noaa; 2019; bahamas; irma; twitter; abaco islands; tropical storm; 2017; hurricane; maria; social media; caribbean; puerto rico","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.","Brendan Fisher et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886","20200612","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?","How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.","Dominik Schraff","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B","20200608","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; corona; political support; netherlands; covid-19; political trust","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Role of Digital Connectivity in Supply Chain and Logistics Systems: A Proposed SIMPLE Framework","Industry 4.0 and its related-cutting edge technologies are generating unprecedented changes and bringing complex challenges in practically all types of business. In this context, new concepts such as digital connectivity, interconnection, and interoperability emerged as highly disruptive approaches for logistics systems and supply chain management (SCM). To shed more light on these complexities and see how companies organized in a SCM model can adopt, implement and operate in a digital connectivity model, this study proposes a framework, namely SIMPLE. To develop the framework, we employed a literature review approach, focusing on recent studies published in journals. After the literature analysis, six dimensions related to digital connectivity in supply chains and logistics emerged, namely Smart, Innovative, Measurable, Profitable, Lean, and Excellence (SIMPLE). This framework brings opportunities for future studies, while providing important insights into the dynamics of digital connectivity in logistics and supply chains. Therefore, these SIMPLE framework dimensions should enable the actors involved in organizations’ operations to interact adequately and harmoniously so as to maximize the value generated in the network.","Queiroz, Maciel M.; Fosso Wamba, Samuel","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-44999-5_7","20200306",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This exploratory study aims to determine the nature of cyber-harassment victimization, its enablers, and the coping mechanisms that online platforms provide to prevent or stop cyber-harassment. An online survey of ninety (n = 90) LGBTQIA+ young adults of ages between 18 and 34 from South Africa reveals a high incidence of exclusion, outing and harassment, covering a wide variety of types, duration and experienced severity, taking place through text messaging and social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Most LGBTQIA+ youth resort to measures such as blocking, deleting offensive content and adjusting privacy settings to cope with cyber-victimization. Worryingly, the most severe effects of harassment such as depression, drug abuse, self-harm and suicide contemplation, have significant correlations with the harassment type used, harassment duration and harassment frequency.

"Understanding Depression from Psycholinguistic Patterns in Social Media Texts","The World Health Organization reports that half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14. Most of these cases go undetected and untreated. The expanding use of social media has the potential to leverage the early identification of mental health diseases. As data gathered via social media are already digital, they have the ability to power up faster automatic analysis. In this article we evaluate the impact that psycholinguistic patterns can have on a standard machine learning approach for classifying depressed users based on their writings in an online public forum.

"Beyond Modelling: Understanding Mental Disorders in Online Social Media","Mental disorders are a major concern in societies all over the world, and in spite of the improved diagnosis rates of such disorders in recent years, many cases still go undetected. Nowadays, many people are increasingly utilising online social media platforms to share their feelings and moods. Despite the collective efforts in the community to develop models for identifying potential cases of mental disorders, not much work has been done to provide insights that could be used by a predictive system or a health practitioner in the elaboration of a diagnosis. In this paper, we present our research towards better visualising and understanding the factors that characterise and differentiate social media users who are affected by mental disorders from those who are not. Furthermore, we study to which extent various mental disorders, such as depression and anorexia, differ in terms of language use. We conduct different experiments considering various dimensions of language such as vocabulary, psychometric attributes and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that positive instances of mental disorders show significant differences from control individuals in the way they write and express emotions in social media. However, there are not quantifiable differences that could be used to distinguish one mental disorder from each other.","Ríssola, Esteban Andrés; Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Crestani, Fabio","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45439-5_20","20200317",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Community-acquired pneumonia among children: the latest evidence for an updated management()","OBJECTIVE: To provide cutting-edge information for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community-acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation = 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77-98%) and 93% (90-99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct aspects of childhood community-acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002","20200318",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"One Health Aotearoa: a transdisciplinary initiative to improve human, animal and environmental health in New Zealand","There is increased recognition that complex health challenges at the human-animal-environmental interface require a transdisciplinary, “whole-of-society” approach. This philosophy is particularly pertinent in Aotearoa-New Zealand because of the country’s relatively isolated island ecosystem, economic reliance on agriculture and its intensification, and existing indigenous worldview that emphasises holism and interconnectivity between humans, animals and the environment. In New Zealand, the One Health Aotearoa (OHA) alliance was established in order to better connect researchers and to address a growing number of infectious diseases challenges. The emphasis of OHA is to bring together and facilitate interactions between people from diverse disciplines, link to stakeholders and communities, and engage with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders, thus providing a holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to address priority questions and achieve desired outcomes in One Health. The initial focus of OHA has been on infectious diseases, but there is increasing recognition of the potential benefits of the alliance to address broader complex issues. Greater involvement and overlap of the environmental sciences, human and animal health sciences, social science, and indigenous kaupapa Maori research is particularly critical for ensuring its success within the New Zealand context. Given the economic and cultural importance of New Zealand’s “clean, green” image, a One Health approach that draws strongly on the environmental sciences makes particular sense. Furthermore, as the global environment becomes increasingly stressed by anthropogenic pressures our research may hold potential solutions for similar challenges elsewhere.","Harrison, Sarah; Baker, Michael G.; Benschop, Jackie; Death, Russell G.; French, Nigel P.; Harmsworth, Garth; Lake, Robin J.; Lamont, Iain L.; Priest, Patricia C.; Ussher, James E.; Murdoch, David R.","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s42522-020-0011-0","20200131",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Quality Improvement Innovation in a Maternal and Child Health Network: Negotiating Course Corrections in Mid-Implementation","This article analyzes mid-implementation course corrections in a quality improvement innovation for a maternal and child health network working in a large Midwestern metropolitan area. Participating organizations received restrictive funding from this network to screen pregnant women and new mothers for depression, make appropriate referrals, and log screening and referral data into a project-wide data system over a one-year pilot program. This paper asked three research questions: (1) What problems emerged by mid-implementation of this program that required course correction? (2) How were advocacy targets developed to influence network and agency responses to these mid-course problems? (3) What specific course corrections were identified and implemented to get implementation back on track? This ethnographic case study employs qualitative methods including participant observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using the analytic method of qualitative description, in which the goal of data analysis is to summarize and report an event using the ordinary, everyday terms for that event and the unique descriptions of those present. Three key findings are noted. First, network participants quickly responded to the emerged problem of under-performing screening and referral completion statistics. Second, they shifted advocacy targets away from executive appeals and toward the line staff actually providing screening. Third, participants endorsed two specific course corrections, using “opt out, not opt in” choice architecture at intake and implementing visual incentives for workers to track progress. Opt-out choice architecture and visual incentives served as useful means of focusing organizational collaboration and correcting mid-implementation problems.","McMillin, Stephen Edward","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42972-020-00004-z","20200508",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Engaging in Late-Life Mental Health Research: a Narrative Review of Challenges to Participation","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This narrative review seeks to ascertain the challenges older patients face with participation in mental health clinical research studies and suggests creative strategies to minimize these obstacles. RECENT FINDINGS: Challenges to older adults’ engagement in mental health research include practical, institutional, and collaboration-related barriers applicable to all clinical trials as well as more personal, cultural, and age-related patient barriers specific to geriatric mental health research. Universal research challenges include (1) institutional barriers of lack of funding and researchers, inter-researcher conflict, and sampling bias; (2) collaboration-related barriers involving miscommunication and clinician concerns; and (3) practical patient barriers such as scheduling issues, financial constraints, and transportation difficulties. Challenges unique to geriatric mental health research include (1) personal barriers such as no perceived need for treatment, prior negative experience, and mistrust of mental health research; (2) cultural barriers involving stigma and lack of bilingual or culturally matched staff; and (3) chronic medical issues and concerns about capacity. SUMMARY: Proposed solutions to these barriers include increased programmatic focus on and funding of geriatric psychiatry research grants, meeting with clinical staff to clarify study protocols and eligibility criteria, and offering transportation for participants. To minimize stigma and mistrust of psychiatric research, studies should devise community outreach efforts, employ culturally competent bilingual staff, and provide patient and family education about the study and general information about promoting mental health.","Newmark, Jordyn; Gebara, Marie Anne; Aizenstein, Howard; Karp, Jordan F.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40501-020-00217-9","20200522",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Intimate Partner Violence Prevention and Intervention Group-Format Programs for Immigrant Latinas: a Systematic Review","Immigrant Latinas (IL) experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) often experience barriers to accessing formal support systems due to immigration-related issues (e.g., fear of deportation, language proficiency, lack of family support in the U.S.). This paper contains a systematic review of peer-reviewed published articles within the past 25 years addressing IPV prevention and intervention programming designed for this vulnerable population. We examined specific group-format programs and curricula conducted at community-based agencies with social services across the country. Qualitative analysis of the 10 articles that met search criteria (i.e., programs must be culturally specific, designed to serve IL, conducted in group-format, focused on IPV intervention or prevention) generated information regarding the nature of group interventions addressing this issue and population. Several themes emerged upon completion of the qualitative review describing key characteristics of each intervention. All reviewed articles reported generally positive outcomes using a variety of methods. Studies using quantitative methods found statistically significant outcomes for constructs including depression, self-esteem, and knowledge of wellness. Professionals from diverse practice settings working with IL would likely benefit by developing intervention and prevention group-format programming to address this problem.","Marrs Fuchsel, Catherine L.; Brummett, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-020-00160-6","20200523",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Trust in and Ethical Design of Carebots: The Case for Ethics of Care","The paper has two main objectives: to examine the challenges arising from the use of carebots as well as to discuss how the design of carebots can deal with these challenges. First, it notes that the use of carebots to take care of the physical and mental health of the elderly, children and the disabled as well as to serve as assistive tools and social companions encounter a few main challenges. They relate to the extent of the care robots’ ability to care for humans, potential deception by robot morphology and communications, (over)reliance on or attachment to robots, and the risks of carebot use without informed consent and potential infringements of privacy. Secondly, these challenges impinge upon issues of ethics and trust which are somewhat overlapping in terms of concept and practice. The existing ethical guidelines, standards and regulations are general in nature and lack a central ethical framework and concrete principles applicable to the care contexts. Hence, to deal with these important challenges, it is proposed in the third part of the paper that carebots be designed by taking account of Ethics of Care as the central ethical framework. It argues that the Ethics of Care offer the following advantages: (a) it provides sufficiently concrete principles and embodies values that are sensitive and applicable to the design of carebots and the contexts of caring practices; (b) it coheres with the tenets of Principlism and select ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics); and (c) it is closely associated with the preservation and maintenance of trust.","Yew, Gary Chan Kok","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-020-00653-w","20200523",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Suicidal ideation, psychopathology and associated factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Suicidal behavior is a prevalent psychiatric emergency in HIV-infected adults. Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18–65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firth’s penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. RESULTS: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/µl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation (M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count < 500 cells/µl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5–123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02–24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.","Ophinni, Youdiil; Adrian; Siste, Kristiana; Wiwie, Martina; Anindyajati, Gina; Hanafi, Enjeline; Damayanti, Reza; Hayashi, Yoshitake","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02666-1","20200524",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Basic Income Advocacy in Canada: Multiple Streams, Experiments and the Road Ahead","Basic income has a long history in Canada, going back to the Great Depression. Its recognition has risen and fallen cyclically, several experiments have been mounted, and some programs, such as the Canada Child Benefit and the Old Age Security demogrant, have been identified as partial basic income schemes. However, a universal basic income for all members of the Canadian political community has never been visibly close to implementation. Against this background, this chapter examines basic income political advocacy from three vantage points. First, the multiple streams framework is used to assess linkages of basic income in the problem stream, its position in the policy stream and forces at play in the political stream. Next, the fate of experiments is described, along with approaches for increasing the likelihood that experiments will result in full-scale policy implementation if outcomes are sufficiently promising. Third, some advocacy strategies for the future are recommended.","Frankel, Sid","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43904-0_8","20200527",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Know Yourself: An Adaptive Causal Network Model for Therapeutic Intervention for Regaining Cognitive Control","Long term stress often causes depression and neuronal atrophies that in turn can lead to a variety of health problems. As a result of these cellular changes, also molecular changes occur. These changes, that include increase of glucocorticoids and decrease of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have the unfortunate effect that they decrease the cognitive abilities needed for the individual to solve the stressful situation. Such cognitive abilities like reappraisal and their adaptation mechanisms turn out to be substantially impaired while they are needed for regulation of the negative emotions. However, antidepressant treatments and some other therapies have proved to be quite effective for the strengthening of such cognitive abilities. This study introduces an adaptive causal network model for this phenomenon where a subject loses his or her cognitive abilities (negative metaplasticity) due to long-term stress and re-improve these cognitive abilities (positive metaplasticity) through mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Simulation results have been reported for demonstration of the phenomenon.","Ullah, Nimat; Treur, Jan","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_28","20200506",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Thirty-five percent of workers who telecommute said their mental health had deteriorated as a result of doing so amid the COVID-19 lockdown, according to a survey conducted by researchers at Keio University in Tokyo, among other institutions, Fox Business reported April 13. The survey was conducted online March 26–28, involving 8,475 employees — including nonregular workers — aged 20 to 64. Of the 21% of respondents who said they work from home, one-half of them did so in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the telecommuters, 50.7% said it had no impact on their mental health, and 14.3% said their mental health had improved. Of the respondents who said doing telework had worsened their mental state, 41.3% said it was difficult to separate their work and personal lives, followed by 39.9% who said they weren't able to exercise enough and 39.7% who said they had difficulty communicating with co-workers. Professor Isamu Yamamoto of the Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, who conducted the survey, said: “There is a risk that working hours will get longer if the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred.

"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Last week, Congress passed its fourth (actually, it was 3.5) stimulus “coronavirus relief” bill. The funding goes mainly to small businesses, followed by hospitals and testing. Originally, it was all going to go to small business, which ran out of its allotment from the $2 trillion in the first package in short order. Democrats added the hospitals and testing. None goes to states for public health or to substance use disorder treatment or prevention. Reporters covering the separate stories of the stimulus package and opioid overdoses never converged on coverage, and most of the opioid stories predicted that the pandemic would make the opioid crisis worse. The opportunity to make changes for the better was restricted, in this field, to removing regulations, not to increasing funding. It is hoped that more funding for treatment for substance use disorder will follow.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32705","20200424",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Caffeine for the Treatment of Apnea in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Overview of Meta-Analyses","BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a common treatment for neonatal intensive care management of the developmental complication of apnea of prematurity in preterm infants. There are several systematic reviews (SRs) on the performance of caffeine in the treatment of apnea. The evidence provided by those, however, is depressed by an information overload due to high heterogeneity in the characteristics as well as the quality of these SRs. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to provide a systematic overview of SRs on the use of caffeine for the management of neonatal apnea. Such overviews are a recent method used to assess and filter top evidence among SRs, enabling enhanced access to targeted information of interest. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted via EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and PubMed since inception to January 2020. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, and assessed the quality of methods and the risk of bias in included SRs based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tools. Extracted data related to study type, characteristics, patients, intervention, comparator, regimen, and outcome measures. RESULTS: Seven SRs with meta-analyses (SRMAs) were included in the current overview, involving a total of 63,315 neonates. SRMAs included randomized clinical and observational studies, with various types of patients, comparators, and outcomes. The quality of SRMAs ranged from critically low (n = 1), low (n = 1), moderate (n = 2), to high (n = 3), and the risk of bias was unclear (n = 2), low (n = 4), and high (n = 1). The effectiveness of caffeine with regard to treatment success and the rate of apnea was not significantly different from that of theophylline or doxapram in two SRMAs. Against control, in one SRMA, while caffeine reduced the rate of failure as well as the need for pressure ventilation, it did not significantly reduce mortality. This comparative effectiveness of caffeine was based on high-quality SRMAs with a low risk of bias. The effectiveness against apnea seems to be enhanced via the administration of early (0–2 days) or high doses of caffeine in one and three SRMAs, respectively. This, nevertheless, was based on lower-quality SRMAs with a higher risk of bias. Safety outcomes were mostly based on comparative SRMAs of different drug regimens, whereby, less tachycardia and lower risk for complications were reported with lower and earlier caffeine administrations, respectively. The evidence behind this, however, was limited in quantity and quality. CONCLUSION: While limited in quantity, there is evidence of non-inferior effectiveness of caffeine against other methylxanthines or doxapram for the management of apnea in neonates. Owing to the limited quality, however, limited evidence exists in support of an optimal administration regimen for caffeine. Further controlled studies are, therefore, needed to confirm the comparative usefulness of caffeine as well as to assess its different potential regimens, including in relation to safety.

"Le confinement généralisé pendant l’épidémie de Coronavirus: Conséquences médico-psychologiques en populations générales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antérieurement de troubles psychiques","Background. – The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. – We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. – We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. – We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. – The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. – Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001","20200605",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Secondary Trauma and Parenting Practices in Internet Crimes against Children Task Force Investigators","Investigating cases of child pornography requires daily exposure to sexually explicit material involving children and may have negative implications on the mental well-being of those in this line of work. This study aimed to identify whether secondary traumatic stress symptoms were associated with participants’ parenting behaviors and concerns about their own children’s use of the internet. Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force workers (n = 212) completed online questionnaires measuring work exposure to sexually explicit material, secondary traumatic stress symptoms, and parenting behaviors. Professionals in this field reported a wide range of secondary trauma symptoms, and their parenting behaviors were both directly and indirectly (via secondary trauma) affected by prolonged exposure to sexually explicit material involving children. Internet monitoring behaviors were more prevalent for parents of younger children, and mothers’ parenting behaviors were more strongly associated with secondary trauma symptoms than were fathers. Results have implications for mental health and parenting services for professionals in this field.","Stewart, Jonathan; Witte, Tricia H.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09530-8","20200606",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Should therapists have a therapist? Science says yes, according to Valentina Stoycheva, Ph.D., founder of Stress & Trauma Evaluation and Psychological Services, in the May 24 issue of Psychology Today. “The longer the current COVID-19 pandemic lasts and the higher its death toll, the more prominent the need for mental health services will become,” Stoycheva wrote. “In turn, this may create a situation in which the demands on mental health professionals' time are at their peak, while their exposure to secondary traumatic stress is increased.” Stoycheva wrote that the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention warns that suicide risk for physicians (including psychiatrists) prior to COVID-19 was 1.5 to 2.25 times higher than the general population. “… A combination of several factors, including exposure to traumatic stress, the mental health needs of society as a whole, and the unwritten code of ethics of healthcare workers, may compromise therapists' own mental health and ability to seek help. It may be time, then, for therapists who have not yet done so, to consider therapy.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32393","20200529",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Among the many breathtaking changes the federal government is making because of COVID-19 (more methadone take-homes, video-only buprenorphine induction) is the recent announcement by the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the Department of Health and Human Services that Medicare beneficiaries be provided more information about methadone, buprenorphine and naloxone, in a harm-reduction-style approach to reducing overdoses among the older population. In a data brief released last month, the OIG notes that people with opioid use disorder (OUD) could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, because of increased risk of respiratory disease, and that most Medicare beneficiaries at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose in 2017 received high amounts of opioids the following year. However, only a quarter received a prescription for naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses. In addition, only 7% of beneficiaries who were at serious risk in 2017 who were diagnosed with an OUD received a medication-assisted treatment drug, “possibly because of challenges that beneficiaries have in accessing prescribers.” For the policy brief, go to https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-19-00130.asp.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32741","20200529",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Adapting for Unique Settings","Although Stepped Care 2.0 is a new model, programming and principles are familiar to many. What is new, are the processes for system building and adjustment discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-030-48055-4_6. Equipped with these processes many institutions are adopting variations of the model to suit their unique ecosystems. Specifically, post-secondary counselling centres across North America and publicly funded mental health care systems in Canadian provinces and territories are now implementing Stepped Care 2.0.

"Structuring mental health support for frontline caregivers during COVID-19: lessons from organisational scholarship on unit-aligned support","BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic exposes frontline caregivers to severe prolonged stresses and trauma, there has been little clarity on how healthcare organisations can structure support to address these mental health needs. This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions. We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services. In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen/women). FINDINGS: To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Army’s efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis. We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings. CONCLUSION: Addressing frontline caregivers’ mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisations’ response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short. An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising.","DiBenigno, Julia; Kerrissey, Michaela","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000279","20200602",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Ontology-Based Inference for Supporting Clinical Decisions in Mental Health","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental and behavioral disorders are increasingly common and currently affect on average 1/4 of the world’s population at some point in their lives, economically impacting communities and generating a high social cost that involves human and technological resources. Among these problems, in Brazil, the lack of a transparent, formal and standardized mental health information model stands out, thus hindering the generation of knowledge, which directly influences the quality of the mental healthcare services provided to the population. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a computational ontology to serve as a common knowledge base among those involved in this domain, to make inferences about treatments, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention methods, helping health professionals in clinical decisions. To do this, we initially carried out a literature review involving scientific papers and the most current WHO guidelines on mental health, later we transferred this knowledge to a formal computational model, building the proposed ontology. Also, the Hermit Reasoner inference engine was used to deduce facts and legitimize the consistency of the logic rules assigned to the model. Hence, it was possible to develop a semantic computational artifact for storage and generate knowledge to assist mental health professionals in clinical decisions.","Yamada, Diego Bettiol; Bernardi, Filipe Andrade; Miyoshi, Newton Shydeo Brandão; de Lima, Inácia Bezerra; Vinci, André Luiz Teixeira; Yoshiura, Vinicius Tohoru; Alves, Domingos","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50423-6_27","20200523",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Application of Healthcare ‘Big Data’ in CNS Drug Research: The Example of the Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN)","Neurological and psychiatric (mental health) disorders have a large impact on health burden globally. Cognitive disorders (including dementia) and stroke are leading causes of disability. Mental health disorders, including depression, contribute up to one-third of total years lived with disability. The Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN) is an international multi-database network that harnesses administrative and electronic medical records from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Using these databases NeuroGEN will investigate medication use and health outcomes in neurological and mental health disorders. A key objective of NeuroGEN is to facilitate high-quality observational studies to address evidence-practice gaps where randomized controlled trials do not provide sufficient information on medication benefits and risks that is specific to vulnerable population groups. International multi-database research facilitates comparisons across geographical areas and jurisdictions, increases statistical power to investigate small subpopulations or rare outcomes, permits early post-approval assessment of safety and effectiveness, and increases generalisability of results. Through bringing together international researchers in pharmacoepidemiology, NeuroGEN has the potential to be paradigm-changing for observational research to inform evidence-based prescribing. The first focus of NeuroGEN will be to address evidence-gaps in the treatment of chronic comorbidities in people with dementia.","Ilomäki, Jenni; Bell, J. Simon; Chan, Adrienne Y.

"Improving Access and Mental Health for Youth Through Virtual Models of Care","The overall objective of this research is to evaluate the use of a mobile health smartphone application (app) to improve the mental health of youth between the ages of 14–25 years, with symptoms of anxiety/depression. This project includes 115 youth who are accessing outpatient mental health services at one of three hospitals and two community agencies. The youth and care providers are using eHealth technology to enhance care. The technology uses mobile questionnaires to help promote self-assessment and track changes to support the plan of care. The technology also allows secure virtual treatment visits that youth can participate in through mobile devices. This longitudinal study uses participatory action research with mixed methods. The majority of participants identified themselves as Caucasian (66.9%). Expectedly, the demographics revealed that Anxiety Disorders and Mood Disorders were highly prevalent within the sample (71.9% and 67.5% respectively). Findings from the qualitative summary established that both staff and youth found the software and platform beneficial.","Forchuk, Cheryl; Fisman, Sandra; Reiss, Jeffrey P.; Collins, Kerry; Eichstedt, Julie; Rudnick, Abraham; Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee; Hoch, Jeffrey S.; Wang, Xianbin; Lizotte, Daniel; Macpherson, Shona; Booth, Richard","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51517-1_17","20200531",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Personalized and Contextualized Persuasion System for Older Adults’ Physical Activity Promoting","Aging often involves a significant change in roles and social positions. The greatest health risk for seniors is the adoption of a sedentary lifestyle that causes isolation, depression, and many diseases. However, convincing an older adult to regularly do physical activities is not generally a simple mission. This paper proposes a personalized and contextualized persuasion system to promote physical activities for older adults. In fact, our approach considers the personal and health profile of the older adult. It also considers different context parameters (context-awareness). This intelligence is guaranteed thanks to the use of the semantic modeling and reasoning, which from different types of information would be able to decide the best moment to trigger notifications from our persuasive system to the participating older adults.","Aloulou, Houssem; Aloulou, Hamdi; Abdulrazak, Bessam; Kacem, Ahmed Hadj","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51517-1_12","20200531",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Improving the Intensive Care Patient Experience With Virtual Reality—A Feasibility Study","OBJECTIVES: Patients’ stays in the ICU are often characterized by prolonged immobility, sedation, disrupted sleep, and extended periods of pain, which put ICU patients at greater risk for ICU-acquired weakness and delirium-related mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using meditative virtual reality to improve the hospital experience of ICU patients. DESIGN: Final report of prospective observational trial. SETTING: Surgical and trauma ICUs of the University of Florida Health, an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-nine nonintubated adult ICU patients without delirium at recruitment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were exposed to sessions of commercially available meditative virtual reality applications focused on calmness and relaxation, performed once daily for up to 7 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures included pain level, pain medication administration, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, delirium status, and patient ratings of the virtual reality system. Comparisons were made using paired t tests and mixed models. The virtual reality meditative intervention improved patients’ ICU experience with reduced levels of anxiety and depression; however, there was no evidence that virtual reality had significant effects on physiologic measures, pain, or sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The use of meditative virtual reality technology in the ICU was easily implemented and well-received by patients.","Ong, Triton L.; Ruppert, Matthew M.; Akbar, Maisha; Rashidi, Parisa; Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Tezcan; Bihorac, Azra; Suvajdzic, Marko","https://www.doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000122","20200608",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The Efficacy of Albumin Dialysis in the Reversal of Refractory Vasoplegic Shock Due to Amlodipine Toxicity","OBJECTIVES: Calcium channel blockers are highly protein-bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension. Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option. Furthermore, this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein-bound drugs and toxins.","Connor-Schuler, Randi L.; Carr, Jennifer M.; Reaven, Matthew S.; Bridgman, Bob T.; Patel, Deepa M.; Subramanian, Ram M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000120","20200605",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The impact of delayed time to first CT head in traumatic brain injury","PURPOSE: Trauma team activation (TTA) criteria trigger early mobilization of resources for the sickest trauma patients. Patients with moderately depressed GCS who do not trigger the highest level activation are at risk for adverse outcomes, potentially from delayed time to intervention. The study objective was to define the impact of time to first CT Head (CTH) on outcomes among blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS. METHODS: Patients from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) databank (2013–2016) with first ED GCS 9–12 were included. Transfers, penetrating mechanisms, death < 24 h, AIS = 6 in any body region, and patients with severe associated injuries were excluded. Study groups were defined by time to first CTH after ED arrival: immediate (= 1 h) vs. delayed (1–6 h). Primary outcomes were time to neurosurgical intervention and time to ED discharge. RESULTS: After exclusions, 4997 patients were identified. Of these, 79% (n = 3,954) underwent immediate CTH and 21% (n = 1,043) had delayed CTH. Median GCS was 11 [10–12] in both groups and there was no difference in median Head AIS (4 [3–4] vs. 4 [3–4], p = 0.586). Time to craniotomy and ICP monitor insertion were longer in the delayed group (4.2 h [3.0–7.6] vs. 3.1 h [2.1–8.7], p = 0.001; and 5.7 h [3.8–13.0] vs. 4.4 h [2.6–12.0], p = 0.008), as was time in the ED (4.3 h [2.7–6.5] vs. 2.1 h [1.2–3.7], p < 0.001). There was no difference in need for craniotomy (11% vs. 10%, p = 0.287), need for ICP monitor (12% vs. 12%, p = 0.899), or mortality (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.160). On multivariate analysis, age > 65 (OR 2.813, p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (OR 2.934, p < 0.001), ED intubation (OR 1.486, p = 0.001), and Head AIS scores of 4 (OR 1.884, p < 0.001) and 5 (OR 6.729, p < 0.001) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH for blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS decreases time to intervention and reduces ED time. A protocol to shorten time to CTH may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals.","Schellenberg, Morgan; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Inaba, Kenji; Demetriades, Demetrios","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00068-020-01421-1","20200625",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Localization of Cell Receptor-Related Genes of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kidney through Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis","BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, uses the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming. Meanwhile, the presence of B0AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney. METHODS: The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. RESULTS: ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung. These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells.","Chen, Qi-Lin; Li, Jia-Qi; Xiang, Zhi-Dan; Lang, Yue; Guo, Guo-Ji; Liu, Zhi-Hong","https://www.doi.org/10.1159/000508162","20200519",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Depressive Symptoms, Body Mass Index, and Physical Activity Self-Efficacy in African American Children","In recent decades, the prevalence of childhood depression and obesity has increased worldwide. African American (AA) children are more obese than White peers and experience many factors that can influence the onset of depressive symptoms. While depression and obesity have been examined in adolescents, there is a paucity of research in AA children. This study examined the relationships among depressive symptoms, obesity, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children. A community sample of 65 AA children completed questionnaires for depressive symptoms and physical activity self-efficacy and also had body mass index (BMI) and BMI Z-scores calculated. Correlational statistics were used to examine associations between variables. Clinically significant total depression scores were present in 22% of children, while 48% were overweight or obese. Overall, children reported high physical activity self-efficacy. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher BMI Z-scores. Results also indicated significant correlations between the children’s physical activity self-efficacy and depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that the associations between depressive symptoms, BMI, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children merit additional examination. Early identification of depression in children may inform future approaches to treatment of psychological and physiological problems within the clinical setting. Screening for childhood depressive symptoms in primary care settings, especially those that specifically treat childhood obesity, can be instrumental in early identification of children with depression. Healthcare providers should be knowledgeable of the clinical presentation of depression and engaged in depression screening.","Williams, Y’Esha V.; Cowan, Patricia A.; Graff, Joyce C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10826-020-01761-x","20200627",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"On Weakening Strategies for PB Solvers","Current pseudo-Boolean solvers implement different variants of the cutting planes proof system to infer new constraints during conflict analysis. One of these variants is generalized resolution, which allows to infer strong constraints, but suffers from the growth of coefficients it generates while combining pseudo-Boolean constraints. Another variant consists in using weakening and division, which is more efficient in practice but may infer weaker constraints. In both cases, weakening is mandatory to derive conflicting constraints. However, its impact on the performance of pseudo-Boolean solvers has not been assessed so far. In this paper, new application strategies for this rule are studied, aiming to infer strong constraints with small coefficients. We implemented them in Sat4j and observed that each of them improves the runtime of the solver. While none of them performs better than the others on all benchmarks, applying weakening on the conflict side has surprising good performance, whereas applying partial weakening and division on both the conflict and the reason sides provides the best results overall.","Le Berre, Daniel; Marquis, Pierre; Wallon, Romain","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51825-7_23","20200626",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Cefepime is Associated with Acute Encephalopathy in Critically Ill Patients: A Retrospective Case–Control Study","BACKGROUND: Acute encephalopathy (AE) is a common complication of critical illness and is associated with increased short and long-term mortality. In this study, we evaluated the role of cefepime in causing AE. METHODS: Retrospective case–control study involving consecutive patients enrolled in the intensive care units (ICUs) of Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2015. AE was defined by the presence of delirium or depressed level of consciousness in the absence of deep sedation. Controls were identified as patients not developing AE and were matched by propensity score for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 24-h Apache III score and invasive ventilation use. RESULTS: The total number of eligible ICU admissions during our study period was 152,999. AE was present in 57,726 (37.7%) with a median AE duration of 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0–51.8) hours. We matched 14,645 cases with AE with the same number of controls. Cefepime was used in 1241 (4.2%) patients and its use was associated with greater incidence of AE [713 (4.9%) vs 528 (3.6%), p < 0.001] and duration [unit estimate 0.73; (95% CI 0.542–0.918)]. On multivariate analysis, cefepime was associated with an increased likelihood of AE after controlling for shock, midazolam infusion and acute kidney injury [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10–1.27)]. These associations were also present after controlling for prior chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: The use of cefepime is associated with increased likelihood and duration of AE. These associations are stronger among patients with impaired renal function, but can also occur in patients without renal impairment.

"Mapping population mental health concerns related to COVID-19 and the consequences of physical distancing: a Google trends analysis","Background: The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people’s concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Duleeka; Evans, Hannah; Marchant, Amanda; Gunnell, David; John, Ann","https://www.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2","20200610",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The effects of emergency medical service work on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of ambulance personnel: a systematic review of qualitative research","BACKGROUND: High rates of mental distress, mental illness, and the associated physical effects of psychological injury experienced by ambulance personnel has been widely reported in quantitative research. However, there is limited understanding of how the nature of ambulance work contributes to this problem, the significant large toll that emergency medical response takes on the individual, and particularly about late and cumulative development of work-related distress among this first responder workforce. METHODS: This study examined peer-reviewed qualitative research published from 2000 to 2018 to outline the effect of emergency medical response work on the psychological, psychosocial, and physical health of paramedics, ambulance officers, ambulance volunteers, and call-takers. Databases searched included: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Ovid EMcare, PsychInfo and Scopus. The systematic review was organised around five key areas: impact of the work on psychological wellbeing; impact of psychological stress on physical wellbeing; how work-related well-being needs were articulated; effects of workflow and the nature of the work on well-being; and, effects of organisational structures on psychological and physical well-being. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Several factors present in the day-to-day work of ambulance personnel, and in how organisational management acknowledge and respond, were identified as being significant and contributing to mental health and well-being, or increasing the risk for developing conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Ambulance personnel articulated their well-being needs across four key areas: organisational support; informal support; use of humour; and individual mechanisms to cope such as detachment and external supports. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between critical incidents and workplace culture and demands have an overwhelming impact on the psychological, physical and social well-being of ambulance personnel. These include day-to-day managerial actions and responses, the impact of shift work, poorly-managed rosters, and long hours of work with little time between for recovery. Mental health issues result from exposure to traumatic events, and the way managers and peers respond to worker distress. Ambulance personnel suffering from work-related stress feel abandoned by peers, management, and the service, during illness, in return-to-work, and post-retirement. Policy, programmes and interventions, and education need to occur at an individual, peer, organisational, and government level.","Lawn, Sharon; Roberts, Louise; Willis, Eileen; Couzner, Leah; Mohammadi, Leila; Goble, Elizabeth","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02752-4","20200703",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Introduction: The Paradoxes and Worries in Contemporary Times","In this introduction, I attempt to map out what I have previously called ‘designer capitalism.’ The way media and technologies in a digitalized world structure existence in what Gilles Deleuze called ‘control societies’ and theorists like Bernard Stiegler continue to develop through an expansive theory of technics, more specifically through his two-volume work on Symbolic Misery. In many respects, this introduction is consonant with Gregory Ulmer’s theorization of ‘electracy,’ which crops up now and again throughout the chapters that follow. Ulmer develops his own ‘electorate transversal,’ a remarkable combination of Spinoza with Nietzsche where pain and pleasure (or sadness and joy) as experiences are theorized within this changed contemporary digitalized world. My emphasis, however, rests with Deleuze and Guattari who play a dominant position throughout this book. In this introduction, I review several important developments to grasp ‘designer capitalism,’ the most prominent being ‘the stack’ by Benjamin Bratton and ‘surveillance capitalism’ by Shoshana Zuboff. Both help us grasp the power of platform capitalism and the place of Big Data in it. This forms a backdrop to my own involvement with South Korean culture and my concerns with (art) pedagogy, technology, and visual media in the chapters that follow. The last part of this introduction offers a hint of what becomes more and more apparent as the book progresses: the questions that surround the Anthropocene, which is explored in the third part of this book, stated sensationally as ‘the end of the world’ as we know it.","jagodzinski, jan","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48618-1_1","20200704",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, Northern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","INTRODUCTION: worldwide, antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed and abused drugs for upper respiratory tract infections. Acute upper respiratory infections are common in children who attend childcare and preventing transmission of disease in health setting depends on actions by parents and staff. Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, northern Ethiopia, 2018. METHODS: a facility-based cross-sectional study design was adopted involving 384 parents of children visited governmental health facilities in Aksum town from February to March, 2018. Respondents were selected based on the proportion of nurses in the health facilities. SPSS version 22 was applied for data entry and analysis. RESULTS: the total number of questionnaires was 384 resulting in a 100% response rate. Almost half of the parents had poor knowledge of the use of antibiotics in children for URTIs 183(47.7%), followed by 156(40.6%) moderate knowledge and 45(11.7%) good knowledge. Practices regarding antibiotic use in children with URTI varied. Only 12.8% of the parents did not always follow the doctors´ advice regarding antibiotic use. In this study has reported many areas in which parental awareness on antibiotic use for acute URTI is considered inadequate, consequently inappropriate knowledge and practices. CONCLUSION: nearly half of the parents attending the physicians for their children with URTI expected to get antibiotics.","Zeru, Teklay; Berihu, Hagos; Buruh, Gerezgiher; Gebrehiwot, Haftom; Zeru, Mebrahtom","https://www.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.35.142.17848","20200429",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Designing dynamic reverse logistics network for post-sale service","The paper addresses the problem of designing a multi-country production–distribution network that also provides services such as repairs and remanufacturing. The proposed work concentrates primarily on post-sale service provided by the firm under warranty returns. The proposed model assumes that existing warehouses can also serve as collection centres or repair centres for reverse logistics. In addition, the model also explores the possibility of establishing a new facility. Hybrid facilities are considered because of their huge cost-cutting potential due to equipment sharing and space sharing. The capacity of hybrid facilities can be expanded to a predefined limit to process returned products without hampering forward logistics operations. However, if a product cannot be repaired at the warehouse, it is transported to the plant for remanufacturing. The model optimizes the overall configuration and operation cost of the production–distribution network. The production–distribution model developed in the paper is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is later transformed to a mixed-integer linear program to reduce the solution time. The usefulness of the model is illustrated using a randomly generated dataset. The model identifies (a) the optimal locations/allocations of the existing/new facilities, (b) the distribution of returned products for refurbishing and remanufacturing, and (c) the capacity expansion of the existing plants and warehouses to facilitate remanufacturing and repair services.","Mishra, Shraddha; Singh, Surya Prakash","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-020-03710-9","20200708",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Connectivity guided theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation versus repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant moderate to severe depression: study protocol for a randomised double-blind controlled trial (BRIGhTMIND)","INTRODUCTION: The BRIGhTMIND study aims to determine the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and mechanism of action of connectivity guided intermittent theta burst stimulation (cgiTBS) versus standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in adults with moderate to severe treatment resistant depression. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a randomised double-blind controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to either 20 sessions of (1) cgiTBS or (2) neuronavigated rTMS not using connectivity guidance. A total of 368 eligible participants with a diagnosis of current unipolar major depressive disorder that is both treatment resistant (defined as scoring 2 or more on the Massachusetts General Hospital Staging Score) and moderate to severe (scoring >16 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)), will be recruited from primary and secondary care settings at four treatment centres in the UK. The primary outcome is depression response at 16 weeks (50% or greater reduction in HDRS-17 score from baseline). Secondary outcomes include assessments of self-rated depression, anxiety, psychosocial functioning, cognition and quality of life at 8, 16 and 26 weeks postrandomisation. Cost-effectiveness, patient acceptability, safety, mechanism of action and predictors of response will also be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by East Midlands Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (ref: 18/EM/0232) on 30 August 2018. The results of the study will be published in relevant peer-reviewed journals, and then through professional and public conferences and media.

"Sedation with ketamine and fentanyl combination improves patient outcomes in intensive care units","Psychological manifestations such as depression and suicidal ideation are commonly caused by poorly controlled pain, anxiety, and sleep deprivation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We are concerned that previous analgesic and sedative techniques administered as single-medication approaches are outdated and inadequate. It is imperative that ICU practitioners are knowledgeable in multimodal approaches to pain and sedation in high acuity settings. We have shown that appropriate combinations of ketamine and fentanyl are effective, and if further supplementation is needed, we utilize additional pharmacological agents in low doses and regional techniques that ultimately lower the overall opioid consumption. We acknowledge that a variety of medication supplementations tailored to the patient’s clinical needs and nature of surgery improves a patient’s outcome in ICU and overall quality of life.","Vitug, Sarah; Ravi, Vikas; Thangathurai, Duraiyah","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00275-3","20200710",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A Performance Class-Based Particle Swarm Optimizer","One of the main concerns with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is to increase or maintain diversity during search in order to avoid premature convergence. In this study, a Performance Class-Based learning PSO (PCB-PSO) algorithm is proposed, that not only increases and maintains swarm diversity but also improves exploration and exploitation while speeding up convergence simultaneously. In the PCB-PSO algorithm, each particle belongs to a class based on its fitness value and particles might change classes at evolutionary stages or search step based on their updated position. The particles are divided into an upper, middle and lower. In the upper class are particles with top fitness values, the middle are those with average while particles in the bottom class are the worst performing in the swarm. The number of particles in each group is predetermined. Each class has a unique learning strategy designed specifically for a given task. The upper class is designed to converge towards the best solution found, Middle class particles exploit the search space while lower class particles explore. The algorithm’s strength is its flexibility and robustness as the population of each class allows us to prioritize a desired swarm behavior. The Algorithm is tested on a set of 8 benchmark functions which have generally proven to be difficult to optimize. The algorithm is able to be on par with some cutting edge PSO variants and outperforms other swarm and evolutionary algorithms on a number of functions. On complex multimodal functions, it is able to outperform other PSO variants showing its ability to escape local optima solutions.","Tungom, Chia Emmanuel; Gulan, Maja; Niu, Ben","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53956-6_16","20200622",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Eleven-year multimorbidity burden among 637 255 people with and without type 2 diabetes: a population-based study using primary care and linked hospitalisation data","OBJECTIVES: To compare the patterns of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities between people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and people without diabetes and how these change by age, gender and deprivation over time between 2004 and 2014. Also, to develop a metric to identify most prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Primary and secondary care, England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 108 588 people with T2D and 528 667 comparators registered in 391 English general practices. Each patient with T2D aged =16 years between January 2004 and December 2014 registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD practices was matched to up to five comparators without diabetes on age, gender and general practice. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities in people with T2D and comparators categorised by age, gender and deprivation. Odds for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities versus comparators. A metric for comorbidities with prevalence of =5% and/or odds =2 in patients with T2D. RESULTS: Overall, 77% of patients with T2D had =1 comorbidity and all comorbidities were more prevalent in patients with T2D than in comparators. Across both groups, prevalence rates were higher in older people, women and those most socially deprived. Conditional logistic regression models fitted to estimate (OR, 95% CI) for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities showed that T2D diagnosis was significantly associated with higher odds for all conditions including myocardial infarction (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.46); heart failure (OR 2.12, 1.84 to 2.43); depression (OR 1.75, 1.62 to 1.89), but non-significant for cancer (OR 1.12, 0.98 to 1.28). In addition to cardiovascular disease, the metric identified osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, schizophrenia and respiratory conditions as highly prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: T2D diagnosis is associated with higher likelihood of experiencing other physical and mental illnesses. People with T2D are twice as likely to have cardiovascular disease as the general population. The findings highlight highly prevalent and under-reported comorbidities in people with T2D. These findings can inform future research and clinical guidelines and can have important implications on healthcare resource allocation and highlight the need for more holistic clinical care for people with recently diagnosed T2D.","Zghebi, Salwa S; Steinke, Douglas T; Rutter, Martin K; Ashcroft, Darren M","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033866","20200701",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Breath Regulation and yogic Exercise An online Therapy for calm and Happiness (BREATH) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. MAIN OUTCOMES: The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility. We will use REDCap to perform randomization in a 1:1 ratio as well as allocation concealment. REDCap is widely used by health researchers worldwide to significantly reduce data entry and study management errors to improve data fidelity. BLINDING (MASKING): All study participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses so as to prevent any expectation bias. Group allocation will be masked during analysis.

"Specific cutting energy reduction of granite using plasma treatment: A feasibility study for future geothermal drilling","Abstract Geothermal Energy is one of the most consistent and viable sources of renewable energy. However, harnessing this energy has proved to be a challenge mainly due to the difficulty in drilling hard igneous rock formations that occur in and around geothermal wells. Therefore, an energy efficient method that can drill hard rocks needs to be developed. In this paper, the effect of micro-scale energy delivery, in the form of plasma, to weaken rock by inducing micro-cracks is studied. Two different types of granite (igneous rock) were sampled and used in this study, out of which the one control group was treated with five, 40kV, 80J pulses of plasma while the other was left uncracked. The effect of the cracks is quantified by conducting facing tests on the plasma cracked and uncracked samples and measuring a reduction in the specific cutting energy. Two different methods were used to estimate the specific cutting energy, where the first method considered the entire cutting process and the second method considered only the stable cutting region. The plasma treatment showed a maximum of 65% and a minimum of 15% reduction in specific cutting energy and was regarded as being dependent on mainly the hardness and size of the samples. All results in this study are validated using statistical analysis.","Kazi, Aamer; Riyaz, Mirza; Tang, Xin; Staack, David; Tai, Bruce","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.077","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Small Diameter-Deep Hole Drilling for Hard-to-Machine Metals - Drilling of <U+03D5>10×400 mm for Ti6Al4V -","Abstract Small diameter-deep hole drilling is indispensable when several main parts of which airplane, automobile, machine tool and metal mould are manufactured. Especially, medical appliances, medical implants and surgical operation tools for brain and bone invariably need small diameter-deep hole drilling for hard-to-machine metals such as stainless steel and Ti6Al4V. The authors newly designed and manufactured a small diameter-deep hole drilling machine by applying technological developments which consist of a direct drive servo spindle motor controlled more precisely, removable steady rests to prevent for a slender fluted hollow shaft of gun drill to be deflected and a highly pressure circulation system of cutting fluid to prevent being clogged with chips. By using the small diameter-deep hole drilling machine and a special gun drill (specially made to order in BOTEK) a drilling of <U+03D5>1.0×400 mm (L/D=400) for Ti6Al4V was carried out.

"Direct Wire-Tension Measurement Based Bowing Correction in Hot Wire Cutting of Polystyrene","Abstract The accuracy of parts produced by hot wire cutting of expanded polystyrene (EPS) is severely affected by bowing of the wire. The degree of bowing depends on the current supplied and the feed rate of the hot wire. Bowing occurs when the current is insufficient to melt the foam ahead of the wire and the mechanical interaction between the foam and the wire increases. This causes an increase in the tension in the wire and this is directly measured using a load cell arrangement. Based on this direct wire tension measurement a real time closed-loop feedback mechanism is implemented which regulates the current to maintain a constant wire tension and eliminates the bowing of the hot wire during the cutting process. For a particular feed rate the feedback mechanism precisely fine tunes the current supplied to the wire such that there is no mechanical drag force between the foam and the wire. The sensitivity of the feedback mechanism is high and responds to very minute contact between the foam and the wire and nominally regulates the current variation in the hot wire, hence, maintaining a constant kerf width throughout the cut. This mechanism allows to significantly improve the accuracy of the EPS part even in complex 3D cutting paths.","Karmakar, Namrata; Chetikena, Harish; M, Venkateshwaran; Subbiah, Sathyan","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.042","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Digital image processing with deep learning for automated cutting tool wear detection","Abstract Tool wear is a cost driver in the metal cutting industry. Besides costs for the cutting tools themselves, further costs appear - equipment downtime for tool changes, reworking of damaged surfaces, scrap parts or damages to the machine tool itself in the worst case. Consequently, tools need to be exchanged on a regular basis or at a defined tool wear state. In order to detect and monitor the tool wear state different approaches are possible. In this publication, a deep learning approach for image processing is investigated in order to quantify the tool wear state. In a first step, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is trained for cutting tool type classification. This works well with an accuracy of 95.6% on the test dataset. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is trained on individual tool type datasets (ball end mill, end mill, drills and inserts) and a mixed dataset to detect worn areas on the microscopic tool images. The accuracy metric for this kind of task, Intersect over Union (IoU), is around 0.7 for all networks on the test dataset. This paper contributes to the perspective of a fully automated cutting tool wear analysis method using machine tool integrated microscopes in the scientific and industrial environment.","Bergs, Thomas; Holst, Carsten; Gupta, Pranjul; Augspurger, Thorsten","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.134","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Reduction of cutting forces by elliptical vibration in multi-pass ultraprecise single point axial cutting of V-grooves","Abstract Elliptical vibration cutting (EVC) is an advanced micromachining technology that has a wide range of applications in high-precision micro/nano manufacturing. This technology is primarily used in fabrication of micro/nano-scale functional surfaces, geometrical features, optical and holographic components that are cut in ferrous and difficult-to-cut tooling materials with high form accuracy and surface quality. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the positive effect of EVC motions on cutting force reduction and stabilization. For this purpose, a series of cutting trials involving the fabrication of micro V-grooves by means of the ultraprecise single point cutting (USPC) were performed. To maintain a constant level of the cutting force, an axial multi-pass cutting strategy with constant cutting area was employed. The influence and advantages brought by EVC over the conventional ‘no-EVC’ USPC scenario were initially assessed by means of the theoretical considerations of the cutting force. Following that, experimental generation of V-grooves has demonstrated that the integration of EVC kinematics with USPC motions has the ability to reduce the ‘no-EVC’ cutting forces by more than 90%, to values around 0.1 N for the main axial component. The addition of EVC motions caused a minimal decrease in surface quality whose areal roughness increased from 14 nm in the ‘no-EVC’ case to 16 nm in the ‘with-EVC’ scenario. These observations are expected to open new opportunities in micromachining of micro/nano products, systems, sensors, functional surfaces, and lighting and holographic optics.","Farrus, Nikolai; Joao, Delfim; Milliken, Nicolas; Tutunea-Fatan, O.

"Salud mental y salud ambiental Una visión prospectiva Informe SESPAS 2020","Resumen El ambiente ha sido, desde los albores de la psiquiatría, un factor fundamental en el estudio y la comprensión de las enfermedades mentales. La relación entre genoma y ambiente ha constituido tradicionalmente un tema central en la investigación de la etiopatogenia de los problemas de salud mental y en la concepción misma de esta. En su aplicación a la psicopatología y a la salud mental, la ambiómica psiquiátrica se ha definido como «el estudio de las condiciones y procesos ambientales que promueven la salud mental o incrementan los riesgos de trastornos mentales». Sin embargo, la salud ambiental, al menos en España y en relación con sus competencias dentro del sistema de salud general, ha centrado su atención en los aspectos relativos a los riesgos ligados a la contaminación física, química o biológica del aire, el agua o la tierra, así como a su correlato alimenticio. Aunque los riesgos ambientales, como la calidad del aire, las temperaturas extremas, el ruido, el cambio climático y distintos tóxicos ambientales, pueden desempeñar un papel muy importante, difícilmente pueden ser identificados como elementos etiopatogénicos únicos. Este trabajo revisa la literatura reciente sobre la investigación ambiental y los problemas de morbimortalidad psiquiátrica. Si bien los resultados son poco concluyentes, las futuras líneas de investigación deberían considerar una colaboración interdisciplinaria más ágil, que permita, por un lado, entender mejor la enfermedad mental, y por otro, avanzar desde la salud ambiental «tradicional» a una que contemple los factores ambientales de tipo social abordando el concepto aún poco estudiado de «contaminación social». Abstract Since the dawn of psychiatry, the environment has been an essential factor in the study and understanding of mental illness. Traditionally, the interrelationship between genome and environment has been a central theme in research on the etiopathogenesis of mental health problems and in the very conception of mental health. In its application to psychopathology and mental health, psychiatric enviromics was defined as «the study of environmental conditions and processes that promote mental health or increase the risk of developing mental disorders». However, environmental health —at least in Spain and in connection with its powers within the Spanish General Health System— has paid attention to aspects pertaining to risks associated with the physical, chemical and biological pollution of the air, the water and the ground, as well as to its correlation with food pollution. Although environmental risks such as air quality, extreme temperatures, noise, climate change and various environmental toxicants can play a particularly important role, they can hardly be identified as single etiopathogenic elements. This work reviews the recent literature on environmental research and problems of psychiatric morbidity and mortality. Although the results are inconclusive, future lines of research should consider a more agile interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing, on the one hand, a better understanding of mental illness and, on the other hand, to be able to shift from “traditional” environmental health to an environmental health that takes social environmental factors into account and seriously addresses the still little studied concept of “social pollution”.","Ordóñez-Iriarte, José María","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.05.007","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Weak chatter detection in milling based on sparse dictionary","Abstract As one of the most unfavorable factors in milling, chatter will lead to poor surface quality, low production efficiency and tool life reduction. Chatter detection, especially weak chatter detection, is an effective way to ensure stable cutting. In this work, the milling dynamic responses based weak chatter detection method is put forward using sparse dictionary. Based on the milling dynamic equations, chatter frequencies are calculated and verified, which are the bases for chatter detection. With the calculated chatter frequencies, the sparse dictionary matrix can be constructed and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted for chatter frequencies reconstruction. The proposed method can extract weak chatter frequencies accurately. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can be successful in weak chatter identification.","Wang, Chenxi; Zhang, Xingwu; Chen, Xuefeng; Yan, Ruqiang; Wang, Peng","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.121","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Anomaly detection in milling tools using acoustic signals and generative adversarial networks","Abstract Acoustic monitoring presents itself as a flexible but under-reported method of tool condition monitoring in milling operations. This paper demonstrates the power of the monitoring paradigm by presenting a method of characterizing milling tool conditions by detecting anomalies in the time-frequency domain of the tools’ acoustic spectrum during cutting operations. This is done by training a generative adversarial neural network on only a single, readily obtained class of acoustic data and then inverting the generator to perform anomaly detection. Anomalous and non-anomalous data are shown to be nearly linearly separable using the proposed method, resulting in 90.56% tool condition classification accuracy and a 24.49% improvement over classification without the method.","Cooper, Clayton; Zhang, Jianjing; Gao, Robert X.; Wang, Peng; Ragai, Ihab","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.059","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","Abstract Purpose The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Methods Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M age = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. Results For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","Dumas, Tara M.; Ellis, Wendy; Litt, Dana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Process Mechanics Based Uncertainty Modeling for Cutting Force Prediction in High Speed Micromilling of Ti6Al4V","Abstract High speed machining is essential to counter the low flexural rigidity of micro-end mill in micromilling process. High speed machining can excite the higher frequency modes and in addition, run-out is also amplified. These effects in high speed micromachining induces the uncertainty in cutting forces. The estimation of cutting coefficients without inclusion of uncertainty cannot give accurate values and hence, the predicted cutting force and machining stability using these cutting coefficient may not be accurate. In the present work, cutting coefficients have been determined using the Bayesian inference which includes the uncertainty in estimated cutting coefficients. Note that, estimated cutting coefficient independent of chip load and cutting velocity does not include the high speed micromachining mechanics like size effect. The cutting coefficients have been estimated as a function of cutting velocity and chip load in the present work. The segmented cutting coefficients for different ranges of cutting speed varying from 10000 rpm to 110000 rpm has been obtained as a non-liner function of chip load. Bayesian inference modelling for cutting coefficients has been carried out using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of prior and posterior distribution has been verified using correlation and trace of samples used for sampling. The posterior distribution shows that there is a good fitting, which accurately predicts the mean of the cutting coefficients. Finally, predicted cutting coefficients have been compared with cutting coefficients obtained from the deterministic approach using least square method. The experimentally estimated cutting coefficients are found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting coefficients with Bayesian inference approach. The predicted cutting coefficients using Bayesian inference shows the deviation of 0.89% and 8.4% at 40000 rpm from experimentally obtained cutting coefficients for tangential and radial cutting coefficients, respectively. The experimental cutting force is found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting force with Bayesian inference based cutting coefficients fitting at 105000 rpm.","Singh, Kundan K.; Singh, Ramesh","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.048","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Optimizing Resident Wellness During a Pandemic: University of British Columbia's General Surgery Program's COVID-19 Experience","Abstract Objective The University of British Columbia's General Surgery Program delineates a unique and systematic approach to wellness for surgical residents during a pandemic. Summary Background Data During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are suffering from increased rates of mental health disturbances. Residents’ duty obligations put them at increased physical and mental health risk. It is only by prioritizing their well-being that we can better serve the patients and prepare for a surge. Therefore, it is imperative that measures are put in place to protect them. Methods Resident wellness was optimized by targeting three domains: efficiency of practice, culture of wellness and personal resilience. Results Efficiency in delivering information and patient care minimizes additional stress to residents that is caused by the pandemic.

"A Machine Vision Based Monitoring System for the LCD Panel Cutting Wheel Degradation","Abstract In Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panel cutting, in-line monitoring of tool wear is important to maintain the dimension precision of finished products and to avoid possible damages to the workpiece. However, limited by the space for camera installation and the miniature structure of the tool itself, monitoring the wear of LCD panel cutting wheel is not a simple task. In this research, we proposed a machine-vision based instrumentation system and a systematic methodology for cutting wheel degradation monitoring. The proposed method describes the degradation of cutting wheel by estimating the tooth height of the cutting wheel blade based on the partially observed random samples. A series of methods are proposed to improve the reliability of the results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on the field data that is collected from three maintenance cycles. The validation results demonstrate consistent degradation trend of the cutting wheel over production cycles.","Wang, Yinglu; Jia, Xiaodong; Li, Xiang; Yang, Shaojie; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.019","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mechanistic Cutting Force Model and Specific Cutting Energy Prediction for Modulation Assisted Machining","Abstract This paper presents a mechanistic model for analytical cutting force and specific energy prediction for modulation assisted turning. Kinematics of the process is used to analyze the cut surface topography and derive the uncut chip thickness variation for various modulation parameters. It is found that uncut chip thickness is governed by successive spindle rotations and can be represented in the form of trigonometric functions. The cut and no-cut phase durations are controlled by the modulation frequency and amplitude. Cutting (machining) forces are predicted based on the orthogonal cutting mechanics. The thin shear plane angle is predicted considering oscillations in the cutting velocity, resultant effective rake angle and by employing the well-known Minimum Energy Principle (MEP). In order to accurately predict the shear forces, length of the shear plane is estimated directly from the uncut and cut part surface geometries, which incorporates waviness of the surface. Analytical chip thickness predictions and proposed cutting force models are combined used to predict the specific cutting energy in MAM. Experimental results verify accuracy of developed force models in estimating cutting forces and energy in orthogonal modulated assisted turning of Al6061 T6511.","Eren, Bora; Sencer, Burak","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.071","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Clean manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V under CO2-snow and hybrid nanofluids","Abstract During the machining of a+ß intermetallic stable titanium alloy, their poor thermal conductivity and resistance at elevated temperature accumulates most of the shearing and friction heat. The resulting heat damage the cutting tool, causes in high power consumption, shorter tool life and poor surface quality. Therefore, it is important to choose a latest cooling technique with excellent capacity to remove heat, chips and frictional effects from the cutting zone. Therefore, Carbon dioxide snow (CO2-snow) and hybrid copper oxide (CuO)-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanofluids based minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) are compared to achieve clean cooling/lubrication technique to machine biomedical/aerospace material Ti-6Al-4V. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was applied to design the experiments. Critical machining parameters are cutting speed (m/min), feed (mm/rev), and cooling mode. The output responses are surface quality Ra (µm), cutting power Pc (W), cutting temperature T (oC), and tool life TL (min) were evaluated under CO2-snow and MQL-hybrid nanofluids. Findings have revealed less surface roughness and longer tool life under hybrid nanofluids.

"Paid Family Leave and Children Health Outcomes in OECD Countries","Abstract During the past four decades, most OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries have adopted or expanded paid family leave, which offers leave to workers following the birth or adoption of a child as well as care for ill family members. While the effects of paid maternity leave on child health have been the subject of a large body of research, little is known about fathers’ leave-taking and the effects of paid paternity leave. This is a limitation, since most of the recent expansion in paid family leave in OECD countries has been to expand leave benefits to fathers. Mothers’ and fathers’ leave-taking may improve child health by decreasing postpartum depression among mothers, improving maternal mental health, increasing the time spent with a child, and increasing the likelihood of child medical checkup. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid family leave on the wellbeing of children, extending what we know about the effects of maternity leave and establishing new evidence on paternity leave. The paper examines the effects of paid family leave expansions on country-level neonatal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, under-five mortality rates, and the measles immunization rates in 35 OECD countries, during the time period of 1990 to 2016. Using an event study design, an approximately 1.9 to 5.2 percent decrease in the infant, neonatal, and under-five mortality rates has been found following the adoption of paid maternity leave. However, the beneficial impact is not as visible for extension of paid leave to fathers. The implications and potential reasons behind the larger protective effects of maternity leave over paternity leave on child health outcomes are discussed.","Khan, Mariam S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105259","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Deep Learning-Based Intelligent Defect Detection of Cutting Wheels with Industrial Images in Manufacturing","Abstract The cutting wheel is an important tool in the television liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing process. The degradation of the cutting wheel significantly affects the LCD panel quality. Currently, there is few effective approaches that can detect the degradation of the cutting wheel at the working station for health monitoring purpose, due to the small size of the component and the complex manufacturing operation. That leads to high economic costs in the production lines in the real industries. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based method for defect detection of the cutting wheels using the industrial images. An end-to-end health monitoring system is built based on machine vision, which directly takes the raw images as inputs, and outputs the detection results. That facilitates the industrial applications since little prior knowledge on image processing and fault detection is required. The experiments on a real-world cutting wheel degradation dataset are carried out for validation. High fault diagnosis testing accuracies are obtained, that indicates the proposed method offers an effective and promising approach for the cutting wheel health monitoring problem.","Yang, Shaojie; Li, Xiang; Jia, Xiaodong; Wang, Yinglu; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.128","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence of Stress, Anxiety and Depression due to Examination in Bangladeshi Youths: A Pilot Study","Abstract An estimated 25% people suffer from mental health disorders worldwide. Almost 7 million suffer from anxiety and depression in Bangladesh. There are several factors that can cause stress among youths, both academic and non-academic, ranging from socioeconomic, environmental, cultural and psychological attributes. However, these are not widely researched in Bangladesh. This study identified the factors that affect the mental health of students due to examinations in Bangladesh, particularly the socio-demographic, lifestyle and psychological factors. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on May 2020 with a sample size of 210 tertiary level students in Dhaka. A modified DASS-21 was used to measure stress, anxiety and depression scores related to examination. Binary logistic model showed that those who lived with family, spent time with parents, had regular sufficient (self-assessed) sleeps and consumed balanced (self-assessed) diets had significantly lower stress, anxiety, and depression. Balanced lifestyle with greater social bonding might help to better equip youths to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression during examination, which could be an avenue for future intervention studies.","Rayhan Arusha, Anowara; Kishore Biswas, Raaj","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105254","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Integrated Tool Condition Monitoring Systems and Their Applications: A Comprehensive Review","Abstract In conventional metal cutting, different tool wear modes, and their individual deterioration rates play vital roles in overall production performance. For a given tool (i.e., geometry or materials), many shop floors still follow a standard rule by pre-setting a tool life, which is conservative but not realistic. Premature failure of a tool can cause unexpected machine downtime and material losses, while another tool could serve beyond that pre-set life. As a result, optimized tool life and productivity cannot be achieved. Moreover, nowadays, there is an increased demand of process monitoring and optimization on the unmanned and the semi-automated shop floors. Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems for process improvement and optimization have been in research for several decades. Both offline and online TCM systems are invented and discussed. A wide range of original publications are reported focusing on different sub-topics, e.g., specific machining process-based TCM methods, measurement or signal acquisition methods, processing methods, and classifiers. With the recent evolution of smart sensors in the era of Industry 4.0, development of online TCM systems received much attention to the researchers. Accordingly, research on some sub-topics also gets motivated into different directions, such as, feasibility of power or current sensors, machine vision technique, and combination of multi-sensors. Thus, from the industrial viewpoint, the current state of implementation of the proposed TCM systems for (near) real-time process monitoring and control needs to be clear. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the TCM systems covering three major machining operations, discusses their application feasibility in industry environments, and states some current TCMS implementations. Challenges being faced by the industry are concluded, along with direction and suggestions for future researches.","Nath, Chandra","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.123","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prediction of Stability Lobe Diagrams in High-Speed Milling by Operational Modal Analysis","Abstract Self-excited regenerative vibration or chatter limits the primary requirements like productivity, surface finish and dimensional accuracy of high-speed machining. It is the most critical factor that severely affects the tool-life and life of the machine tool. Out of several methods followed for suppressing and avoiding chatter, machining conditions chosen with stability lobe diagram is the most reliable way. Stability lobe diagrams are typically generated by knowing specific cutting force coefficients and tool point frequency response functions (FRFs). Inaccurate use of tool point FRFs significantly affects the stable regions of stability lobe diagrams. As tool-point FRFs are influenced by gyroscopic effect, centrifugal force, thermal change in bearing dynamics, etc. during machining, it is important to consider the effect of these factors on tool point FRFs in order to generate accurate stability lobe diagrams. The present work covers a new approach for estimating tool point FRFs during machining operations, employing cutting tool vibration signals. For measuring the vibration at the tip of end mill at different spindle speeds, a non-contact laser vibrometer is used. In order to remove the tooth pass frequency and its harmonics from the measured signals, a comb filter is employed. The filtered signal is subjected to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) in order to derive tool point FRFs. With the estimated FRFs at different spindle speeds, the stability lobe diagrams are drawn for high-speed milling machine. Comparative study of stability lobe diagrams, drawn with static modal analysis and Operational Modal Analysis, have shown that the cutting conditions chosen from stability lobe diagram derived with OMA, are found to be more realistic for avoiding chatter during high-speed milling applications.","Paliwal, Vineet; Babu, N.

"Development of a Vise with built-in Piezoelectric and Strain Gauge Sensors for Clamping and Cutting Force Measurements","Abstract Accurate measurement of static and dynamic forces during machining operations is important in the process monitoring, optimization and prediction of machining quality. Cutting and clamping forces are typically measured separately, for example, through hydraulic clamping force devices and piezoelectric table dynamometers. Since cutting and clamping forces interact throughout machining, both forces need to be measured simultaneously to accurately predict machining quality. This paper proposes a novel force measuring device in the form of a vise with built-in piezoelectric sensors and strain gauges to measure multi-axial clamping and cutting forces simultaneously. A strain concentrating design based on a cross-shaped groove was utilized to attach three strain gauges to measure clamping forces. These locations were chosen for their ability to measure clamping forces in real-time and minimize cross-talks. Piezoelectric sensors were embedded between layers in the vise jaw to measure cutting forces. A prototype of the proposed apparatus was fabricated and used to experimentally investigate sensitivities, bandwidth, clamping forces and cutting forces. The results showed that the proposed device has good performance in measuring clamping and cutting forces in milling operations.","Rezvani, Sina; Nikolov, Nicholas; Kim, Chang-Ju; Park, Simon S.; Lee, Jihyun","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.143","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeons’ performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. Methods Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24–26° temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. Results The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3 ± 8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9 ± 3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6 ± 5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. Conclusion A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears. Besides this, the workable vision is maintained for a prolonged duration.","Kumar, Arvind; Qureshi, Owais Ahmed; Arora, Rajesh; Kumar, Sandeep; Jameel, Javed; Khan, Rizwan","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.07.009","20200717",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Experimental comparison of material removal rates in abrasive waterjet cutting and a novel droplet stream technique","Abstract The use of abrasive waterjets (AWJ) to machine metal surfaces is prevalent through-out industry. AWJ requires the purchase and disposal of costly abrasive particles which increases manufacturing costs and environmental-footprint. This motivates the exploration for low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives. A novel method which utilizes a stream of high-speed water droplets (WD) travelling through a sub-atmospheric pressure environment to remove material without using abrasive grit is presented. In this paper, the efficacy of this new process is investigated and compared to AWJ and pure water jet (WJ) (i.e., without abrasive particles) by measuring the material removal rates (MRR) of each process on a hard-to-machine steel, DP 1180, for equivalent water-flow conditions. Trench profiles are created by traversing each of the jets across a metal sample, from which the MRR and trench profiles are obtained. The MRR results reveal that WD is significantly faster than WJ, but is subordinate compared to AWJ for MRR efficiency. This identifies a trade-off between manufacturing cost and time.","Mitchell, Benjamin R.; Demian, Sohani A.R.; Korkolis, Yannis P.; Kinsey, Brad L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.085","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Determination of Johnson-Cook material model parameters for AISI 1045 from orthogonal cutting tests using the Downhill-Simplex algorithm","Abstract Despite the increasing digitalization of manufacturing processes in the context of Industry 4.0, the process design and development of machining processes poses major challenges for today’s manufacturing technology. Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical ""trial-and-error"" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 %. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.","Bergs, Thomas; Hardt, Marvin; Schraknepper, Daniel","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.081","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Feeling Like It is Time to Reopen Now? COVID-19 New Normal Scenarios based on Reopening Sentiment Analytics","The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new normal future.","Samuel, Jim; Rahman, Md.

"Anomaly detection methods in turning based on motor data analysis","Abstract A cutting anomaly can be detected by using machine learning and pattern recognition in addition to the conventional method of using cutting knowledge to determine the criteria of detection. However, it is difficult to guarantee that all cutting anomalies can be detected during mass production due to various events that can occur. Moreover, machine learning and pattern recognition are not systemized for use in mass production. In this work, we investigated the detection of turning anomalies during mass production under optimized cutting conditions. We applied a method that utilizes the motor current of each operating axis to monitor the machining state without affecting the machining process and determines the correlation between turning anomalies and motor data. Our target was the unsteady anomalies that appear in mass production, such as chip biting and tool vibration. On the basis of the obtained correlation, we developed a formalized anomaly detection method using traditional statistics and a systemized anomaly detection method using discretization and pattern recognition based on the Mahalanobis Taguchi method with auto parameter tuning to eliminate the need for detailed analysis based on knowledge of cutting phenomena. Both methods achieved a detection accuracy of over 98%.","Watanabe, Tsubasa; Kono, Ippei; Onozuka, Hideaki","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.126","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Machinability and Surface Integrity Characterization in Hard Turning of AISI 4320 Bearing Steel Using Different CBN Inserts","Abstract The thermomechanical interaction between the cutting tool and the workpiece in any material removal process is a key factor in defining the efficiency and productivity of the process. It is especially important in cutting hard-to-machine materials such as titanium- and nickel-based alloys or hardened steels. The productivity of the process can be defined in terms of machining time, intervals of tool change (due to tool wear) and surface integrity characteristics such as dimensional tolerances, surface roughness and the machining-affected zone. The objective of this work is to conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of three different industrial-grade CBN cutting inserts during hard turning of AISI 4320 case-carburized steel. The CBN inserts all had the same geometry but used different edge preparation and coating technologies. To quantify tool performance, the cutting forces and tool wear were measured at consistent intervals and the surface integrity of the workpiece was characterized in terms of surface roughness, white and dark layer depths, micro-hardness and residual stresses. Results show that the stability of the cutting edge on two of the tested inserts plays an important role in determining tool life (where 60% higher tool life was achieved compared to the other tested insert with unstable cutting edge), cutting force stability and the formation of compressive residual stresses on the surface of the turned workpiece","Niaki, Farbod Akhavan; Haines, Eric; Dreussi, Roman; Weyer, Gregory","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.087","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prediction of specific cutting forces and maximum tool temperatures in orthogonal machining by Support Vector and Gaussian Process Regression Methods","Abstract In this paper, machine learning (ML) models, namely Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), are presented for the prediction of specific cutting forces and maximum tool temperatures during orthogonal machining processes. The training/test data for building the ML models is generated from finite element (FE) simulations. The simulations are performed using the commercial FE package Abaqus/Explicit and validated using experimental results. The FE generated data consists of cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and rake angle as the input parameters. The response variables are the cutting force and maximum tool temperature. The data is split into training and test sets using 80-20 split. The optimal SVR and GPR models are selected using grid search on the training data. The predictions on the test data sets show that both the models perform well with high accuracy in predicting cutting force and maximum tool temperature. Between the two models, the mean square errors (MSE) for SVR are less than those for GPR.","Hashemitaheri, Maryam; Mekarthy, Sai Manish Reddy; Cherukuri, Harish","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.139","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Structured light scanning is implemented to identify the spatial coordinates of the points that define the multiple insert cutting edges. These points are analyzed to extract the cutting edge radius and angle values, which are then incorporated in a time domain simulation that predicts cutting force and tool/workpiece deflection for user-selected operating parameters. Good agreement between predicted and measured cutting forces is first demonstrated. The process stability is then predicted using the validated force model and measured structural dynamics. Observations about the stability dependence on insert geometry are finally presented for a selected end mill.","Gomez, Michael; No, Timothy; Smith, Scott; Schmitz, Tony","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.067","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Dry Ultra-Precision Machining of Tungsten Carbide with Patterned nano PCD Tool","Abstract Texturing on the rake face of the tool without the metal working fluid is a potential method to reduce the friction coefficient in ultra-precision machining of tungsten carbide (WC) with a diamond tool. Low friction coefficient of the patterned tool would generate less heat in the tool-work interface and improve the tool life. This paper studies the effect of texturing on the cutting performance in ultra-precision machining of WC with a nano-polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool. Orthogonal cutting experiments were conducted to verify the cutting performance of the textured diamond tool in machining of WC. The linear patterns parallel and perpendicular to the cutting direction were fabricated on the rake face of the nano-PCD tool by using the focused ion beam process. The experimental result showed that the friction coefficient of the perpendicular patterned tool decreased by 10%. WC surface machined with the patterned tool and non-patterned tool was also analyzed and compared. Material separation at grain boundary between tungsten grains and cobalt and full detachment of tungsten grains dominantly affected the surface quality of the machined WC surface.","Maeng, Sangjin; Min, Sangkee","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.068","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Geometric simulation of power skiving of internal gear using solid model with triple-dexel representation","Abstract Gear manufacturing is a fundamental technology for machine production. Power skiving has rapidly become an efficient method for the manufacturing of internal high-precision gears. To analyze the cutting force during power skiving, a geometric simulation of the power skiving process, particularly a visualization of the resulting machining shape and a prediction of the chip geometry generated during the cutting process, is important. In this study, we propose a novel method for precisely simulating the power skiving process using solid modeling. The resulting shape of power skiving is computed by repeatedly subtracting the swept volume of the cutting edge from a solid model of the workpiece. To realize a robust computation in a subtraction operation, a solid model with triple-dexel representation is used to represent the workpiece shape. To accelerate the operations, the parallel processing function of a graphics processing unit (GPU) is used. An experimental simulation system is implemented, and some computational experiments are conducted.","Inui, Masatomo; Huang, Yu; Onozuka, Hideaki; Umezu, Nobuyuki","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.078","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"On-machine measurement-based compensation for machining of thin web parts","Abstract Thin web parts are widely used in the aerospace industry; however, serious machining errors may happen due to their low rigidity. In this study, a highly automatic method that integrates machining status monitoring, on-machine measurement (OMM) inspection, machining error modeling and real time compensation is proposed and developed. The OMM inspection is firstly applied to measure the comprehensive machining errors, the Hampel filtering, the triangulation-based cubic interpolation and a machine learning algorithm are then used to train the machining error model. Finally, the real time compensation of high-density cutting points is realized by developing the compensation system based on External Machine Zero Point Shift (EMZPS) function of machine tool. The proposed method was validated through three sets of compensation experiment of a thin web part. The results revealed that 58.1%, 68.4% and 62.6% of the machining error ranges were decreased, respectively. This method demonstrates immense potential for further applications in efficiency and accuracy improvement of thin-walled freeform surface parts.","Ge, Guangyan; Du, Zhengchun; Yang, Jianguo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.122","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Comparison of Flow Stress of Aluminum Alloy 6061-T6 Obtained From Chip Pulling Orthogonal Cutting and Kolsky Bar Testing","Abstract Machining can be used as a test for the flow stress of materials under conditions of high strain (e > 1) and strain rate (102/s to 106/s). Constitutive models of metallic materials are conventionally obtained by dynamic compression tests such as the Split-Hopkinson (Kolsky) bar test at lower strain (e < 0.3) and strain rate (103/s to 104/s). To compare the flow stress obtained from both tests under identical conditions, the strain in the primary shear zone (PSZ) in orthogonal cutting tests has been lowered using high rake angle (a = 45°) cutting tools to e ˜ 0.8, and by adding chip pulling to e ˜ 0.5. To our knowledge this is the first time that flow stress estimates are obtained from machining at such low strain values. With some modifications, the strain in Kolsky bar testing has been increased up to e = 0.8, and the stress-strain curve obtained is compared to flow stress estimates from orthogonal cutting tests under the same strain and similar strain rates. The results work, show for the first time, that the flow stress measured from cutting tests agree closely with those obtained from Kolsky bar testing.","Cui, Changlong; Bhavsar, Pavan; Lopez-Hawa, Homar; Madhavan, Vis; Moscoso-Kingsley, Wilfredo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.161","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Influence of cutting fluid application frequency on the surface quality of micromilled slots on Inconel 718 alloy","Abstract Micromilling is a machining process defined by its low dimensions. In general, it is defined by the cutting tool diameter that must vary between 1 µm and 1000 µm. This process is used mostly in molds, medical applications and Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), where high quality parts are required in terms of geometry, which are absent of defects and possess smooth surfaces. However, there exist hurdles that need to be crossed in order to achieve these high-quality parts, most frequently surface roughness and the presence of burrs. For such phenomena, one common solution is the appliance of cutting fluids. To this end, some research studies have been developed, these have placed their focus upon the different composition of cutting fluid, which is applied with different pressures and at different rates. The application of cutting fluid can be made through pulses, as this is a common configuration for the MQL fluid supplier. The frequency of pulses defines the volume of cutting fluid applied and consequently affects the results. In this sense, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the frequency of cutting fluid application over the final part of the cutting process. The results demonstrated that for the difficult to cut Inconel 718, if a low frequency of fluid, delivered by MQL, is applied, the final piece will not be homogeneous, as well as leaving parts with a low surface quality and higher burr formation.","de Oliveira, Déborah; Gomes, Milla Caroline; da Silva, Márcio Bacci","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.082","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Effect of Workpiece Curvature on Axial Surface Error Profile in Flat End-Milling of Thin-walled Components","Abstract The advancements in the domain of CAD/CAM and CNC machine tools facilitated machining of complex geometric shapes to meet functional requirements and/or aesthetic appearances. These shapes combine several geometric features such as zero curvature (straight), constant curvature (circular) and variable curvature surfaces. The components often contain thin-walled sections having inherently lower stiffness that induces static deflections transforming into surface error and violation of error limits specified by the designer. This paper presents a comparison of deflection induced surface error profile generated during the end milling of zero and constant curvature thin-walled components. The proposed framework incorporates computational model to estimate cutting forces, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model to compute workpiece deflections, and surface generation mechanism to derive error profile. The paper also investigates the effect of change in the radial engagement area due to workpiece curvature by introducing the concept of ‘Equivalent Radial Depth of Cut’. Further, the effect of change in workpiece curvature is investigated on the surface error profile in the paper. The proposed framework has been generalized to accommodate the variation of workpiece geometry, and the results are validated by conducting a set of end milling experiments.","Agarwal, Ankit; Desai, K.

"Addressing the Problem of Severe Underinvestment in Mental Health and Well-Being from a Human Rights Perspective","Throughout the world, mental health remains a neglected priority, low on the agenda of policy makers and funders at the national and international levels. While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions—which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience—there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to “scale up” mental health and to reduce “treatment gaps” are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed, Faraaz","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200621",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A Key, Not a Straitjacket: The Case for Interim Mental Health Legislation Pending Complete Prohibition of Psychiatric Coercion in Accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","The practice of coercion on the basis of psychosocial disability is plainly discriminatory. This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former’s interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim “holding” legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant “permission” for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","Davidson, Laura","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200621",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Depression Detection with Multi-Modalities Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Model on Social Media","Social networks enable people to interact with one another by sharing information, sending messages, making friends, and having discussions, which generates massive amounts of data every day, popularly called as the user-generated content. This data is present in various forms such as images, text, videos, links, and others and reflects user behaviours including their mental states. It is challenging yet promising to automatically detect mental health problems from such data which is short, sparse and sometimes poorly phrased. However, there are efforts to automatically learn patterns using computational models on such user-generated content. While many previous works have largely studied the problem on a small-scale by assuming uni-modality of data which may not give us faithful results, we propose a novel scalable hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect depressed users on social media such as Twitter-based on multi-modal features. Specifically, we encode words in user posts using pre-trained word embeddings and BiGRUs to capture latent behavioural patterns, long-term dependencies, and correlation across the modalities, including semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). The CNN model then helps learn useful features. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several popular and strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.","Zogan, Hamad; Wang, Xianzhi; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200703",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?","The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200511",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Monitoring Depression Trend on Twitter during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected people's daily lives and caused tremendous economic loss worldwide. However, its influence on people's mental health conditions has not received as much attention. To study this subject, we choose social media as our main data resource and create by far the largest English Twitter depression dataset containing 2,575 distinct identified depression users with their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people's Twitter language, we train three transformer-based depression classification models on the dataset, evaluate their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compare the model's""tweet chunk""-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we create a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users' demographic information and investigate these features' relations to depression signals. Finally, we demonstrate our model's capability of monitoring both group-level and population-level depression trends by presenting two of its applications during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Examination of community sentiment dynamics due to covid-19 pandemic: a case study from Australia","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lock-down and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lock-down, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Jianlong; Yang, Shuiqiao; Xiao, Chun; Chen, Fang","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200622",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Public Opinion and Emotion Monitoring System Based on Time Series Thermal New Word Mining","With the spread and development of new epidemics, it is of great reference value to identify the changing trends of epidemics in public emotions. We designed and implemented the COVID-19 public opinion monitoring system based on time series thermal new word mining. A new word structure discovery scheme based on the timing explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment analysis method for the COVID-19 public opinion environment is proposed. Establish a""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter""distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.","Zhang, Yixian; Chen, Jieren; Liu, Boyi; Yang, Yifan; Li, Haocheng; Zheng, Xinyi; Chen, Xi; Ren, Tenglong; Xiong, Naixue","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200523",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Detecting Community Depression Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented impact across the globe. We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding actions more objectively in specific regions if necessary but also allows users to perceive the dynamics of depression over the time.","Zhou, Jianlong; Zogan, Hamad; Yang, Shuiqiao; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong; Chen, Fang","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200705",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200508",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Centralized and decentralized isolation strategies and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200408",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"What are We Depressed about When We Talk about COVID19: Mental Health Analysis on Tweets Using Natural Language Processing","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recently has affected human life to a great extent. Besides direct physical and economic threats, the pandemic also indirectly impact people's mental health conditions, which can be overwhelming but difficult to measure. The problem may come from various reasons such as unemployment status, stay-at-home policy, fear for the virus, and so forth. In this work, we focus on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze tweets in terms of mental health. We trained deep models that classify each tweet into the following emotions: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise and trust. We build the EmoCT (Emotion-Covid19-Tweet) dataset for the training purpose by manually labeling 1,000 English tweets. Furthermore, we propose and compare two methods to find out the reasons that are causing sadness and fear.","Li, Irene; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao; Alvarez-Napagao, Sergio; Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Suzumura, Toyotaro","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200422",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Twitter discussions and emotions about COVID-19 pandemic: a machine learning approach","The objective of the study is to examine coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related discussions, concerns, and sentiments that emerged from tweets posted by Twitter users. We analyze 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 25 hashtags such as""coronavirus,""""COVID-19,""""quarantine""from March 1 to April 21 in 2020. We use a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigram, bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected Tweets. Popular unigrams include""virus,""""lockdown,""and""quarantine.""Popular bigrams include""COVID-19,""""stay home,""""corona virus,""""social distancing,""and""new cases.""We identify 13 discussion topics and categorize them into five different themes, such as""public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,""""social stigma associated with COVID-19,""""coronavirus news cases and deaths,""""COVID-19 in the United States,""and""coronavirus cases in the rest of the world"". Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of coronavirus are anticipation that measures that can be taken, followed by a mixed feeling of trust, anger, and fear for different topics. The public reveals a significant feeling of fear when they discuss the coronavirus new cases and deaths than other topics. The study shows that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for infodemiology study by studying the evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19. Real-time monitoring and assessment of the Twitter discussion and concerns can be promising for public health emergency responses and planning. Already emerged pandemic fear, stigma, and mental health concerns may continue to influence public trust when there occurs a second wave of COVID-19 or a new surge of the imminent pandemic.","Xue, Jia; Chen, Junxiang; Hu, Ran; Chen, Chen; Zheng, ChengDa; Liu, Xiaoqian; Zhu, Tingshao","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200526",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Detecting Topic and Sentiment Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly influenced people's daily lives across the globe. Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like ``stay safe home""are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as ``people death""are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics.","Yin, Hui; Yang, Shuiqiao; Li, Jianxin","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200705",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Keynesian models of depression Supply shocks and the COVID-19 Crisis","The objective of this work is twofold: to expand the depression models proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations, and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be falsified.","Romana, Ignacio Escanuela","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200711",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Altruism and anxiety: Engagement with online community support initiatives (OCSIs) during Covid-19 lockdown in the UK and Ireland","Given concerns about mental health during periods of Covid-19 lockdown, it important to understand how engagement with online Covid-19 related material can affect mood. In the UK and Ireland, online community support initiatives (OCSIs) have emerged to help people manage their lives. Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company). Those who did so reported feeling significantly calmer afterwards, those who engaged for general concerns (e.g. in response to anti-social behaviour) reported feeling significantly more anxious afterwards, but there was no difference in reported mood for those who engaged for other reasons (e.g. to share experiences or views). Thus, engaging with an OCSI for altruistic purposes might help to make people feel calmer.","Elphick, Camilla; Stuart, Avelie; Philpot, Richard; Walkington, Zoe; Frumkin, Lara; Zhang, Min; Levine, Mark; Price, Blaine; Pike, Graham; Nuseibeh, Bashar; Bandara, Arosha","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200612",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell.

This paper describes the architecture underlying the chatbot. The architecture supports a range of over 20 activities delivered in a 4-week program by relatable personas. The architecture provides a visual authoring interface to its content management system. In addition to supporting the original adolescent resilience chatbot, the architecture has been reused to create a 3-week 'stress-detox' intervention for undergraduates, and subsequently for a chatbot to support young people with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all three systems having been used in field trials. The Headstrong architecture illustrates the feasibility of creating a domain-focused authoring environment in the context of e-therapy that supports non-technical expert input and rapid deployment.","Holt-Quick, Chester; Warren, Jim; Stasiak, Karolina; Williams, Ruth; Christie, Grant; Hetrick, Sarah; Hopkins, Sarah; Cargo, Tania; Merry, Sally","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200515",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

However, we think that a comprehensive survey towards the essentials of blockchains by exploiting the state-of-the-art theoretical modelings, analytic models, and useful experiment tools is still missing. To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized finally for future research directions. We wish this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.","Huang, Huawei; Kong, Wei; Zhou, Sicong; Zheng, Zibin; Guo, Song","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200707",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Visualising COVID-19 Research","The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200513",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes.

"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200422",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users.

The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof. Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm. The proposed consensus architecture allows Gravity to be considered a singular decentralized blockchain-agnostic oracle.","Pupyshev, Aleksei; Gubanov, Dmitry; Dzhafarov, Elshan; Sapranidi, llya; Kardanov, Inal; Zhuravlev, Vladimir; Khalilov, Shamil; Jansen, Marc; Laureyssens, Sten; Pavlov, Igor; Ivanov, Sasha","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200702",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Clinical Trial Drug Safety Assessment for Studies and Submissions Impacted by COVID-19","In this paper, we provide guidance on how standard safety analyses and reporting of clinical trial safety data may need to be modified, given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact could include missed visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits), alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug interruptions. We focus on safety planning for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and integrated summaries for submissions. Starting from the recommended safety analyses proposed in white papers and a workshop, created as part of an FDA/PHUSE collaboration (PHUSE 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), we assess what modifications might be needed. Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression). Analyses of laboratory measurements may need to be modified to account for the combination of measurements from local and central laboratories.","Nilsson, Mary; Crowe, Brenda; Anglin, Greg; Ball, Greg; Munsaka, Melvin; Shahin, Seta; Lilly, Wei Wang Eli; Company,; Indianapolis,; USA, IN; MerckCo.,; Inc.,; Rahway,; NJ,; USA,; Inc., AbbVie; Chicago, North; IL,; Inc., Amgen; Oaks, Thousand; CA,; Inc., Eli Lilly Canada; Toronto,; Ontario,; Canada,","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200605",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 Twitter Dataset with Latent Topics, Sentiments and Emotions Attributes","This resource paper describes a large dataset covering over 63 million coronavirus-related Twitter posts from more than 13 million unique users since 28 January to 1 July 2020. As strong concerns and emotions are expressed in the tweets, we analyzed the tweets content using natural language processing techniques and machine-learning based algorithms, and inferred seventeen latent semantic attributes associated with each tweet, including 1) ten attributes indicating the tweet's relevance to ten detected topics, 2) five quantitative attributes indicating the degree of intensity in the valence (i.e., unpleasantness/pleasantness) and emotional intensities across four primary emotions of fear, anger, sadness and joy, and 3) two qualitative attributes indicating the sentiment category and the most dominant emotion category, respectively. To illustrate how the dataset can be used, we present descriptive statistics around the topics, sentiments and emotions attributes and their temporal distributions, and discuss possible applications in communication, psychology, public health, economics and epidemiology.","Gupta, Raj Kumar; Vishwanath, Ajay; Yang, Yinping","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200714",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Symptom extraction from the narratives of personal experiences with COVID-19 on Reddit","Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200521",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Women worry about family, men about the economy: Gender differences in emotional responses to COVID-19","Among the critical challenges around the COVID-19 pandemic is dealing with potentially detrimental effects on people's mental health. Designing appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society. The findings align with general gender differences in language found elsewhere, but the current unique circumstances likely amplified these effects. We close this paper with a call for more high-quality datasets due to the limitations of Tweet-sized data.","Vegt, Isabelle van der; Kleinberg, Bennett","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200417",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments. The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","Rahman, Md.

The “Strive for Five” campaign aims to educate and encourage New Yorkers to use a variety of strategies, such as phone, text, web, social media, and other applications and Zoom technologies to reach out and offer mental health support to at least five people over the next 30 days. As movement is increasingly restricted, virtual check-ins grow more important each day, advocates stated. “We encourage New Yorkers to connect with people who may be isolated, lonely or live alone, and to reach out to neighbors, friends, families and co-workers. First responders, health care workers and other individuals who are courageously keeping our essential services open also need support now, as do caregivers who are hard at work taking care of others,” said NYAPRS and the coalition.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32300","20200327",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel","Abstract Grinding is extensively used as surface generation process in finishing operations, which makes it imperative that the generated surface adheres closely to strict quality check norms failing which the component will be rejected incurring a loss to the industry. To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface. The outcome of present paper enables to understand and report the surface interactions quantified in terms of cutting, ploughing and rubbing whereas surface parameters are characterized as per ISO 25178. The reasoning behind variations during surface interactions was discussed and interpretations were reported.","Choudhary, Akshit; Babu, N Ramesh","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.080","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Patient reported outcomes of breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in the epicenter of China: A cross sectional survey study","PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the psychological status in breast cancer (BC) patients in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple breast cancer centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and included demographic information, clinical features, and four Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) scales (GAP-7, PHQ-9, ISI, and IES-R). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from February 16 to 19, 2020, the peak time point of COVID-19 outbreak in China. 46.2% BC patients had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. 8.9% and 9.3% patients reported severe anxiety and severe depression, respectively. 20.8% and 4.0% patients showed severe distress and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes and close contact with COVID-19 patients as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and CVC (central venous catheter) flushing delay were independently association factors depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to psychological status of breast cancer patients especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes and metastatic breast cancer.","Juanjuan, Li; Santa-Maria, Cesar Augusto; Hongfang, Feng; Lingcheng, Wang; Pengcheng, Zhang; Yuangbing, Xu; Yuyan, Tan; Zhongchun, Liu; Bo, Du; Meng, Lan; Qingfeng, Yang; Feng, Yao; Yi, Tu; Shengrong, Sun; Xingrui, Li; Chuang, Chen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003","20200607",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How to deal with the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 for people who pay attention to anxiety and depression","BACKGROUND: The fear of insecurity and uncertainty caused by 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the separation and loss of certain important relationships, and the great changes in lifestyle have awakened strong emotional response, which may cause psychological problems to the general population. However, there are few researches on how the people who pay attention to anxiety and depression coping with negative psychological during the epidemic or major disaster. This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during the epidemic. METHODS: From February 1, to March 8 in 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. The probable depression, anxiety symptoms and coping behaviors was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 and the self-made Coping Behaviors Questionnaires. RESULT: Among 17249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed the assessment of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders finished the assessment of the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population had a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders and anxiety disorders were34.66% and 56.93%, respectively. Those who are old, female, low education, low income, and cohabiting were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. Students are a high-risk group suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga. CONCLUSION: During the epidemic, our findings identify some spontaneous coping behaviors that can probably relieve the psychological impact of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ge, Fenfen; Wan, Mentong; Zheng, Anni; Luo, Guan; Zhang, Jun","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pcmedi/pbaa023","20200623",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Malay Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Validity and Reliability","The newly developed Persian Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item uni-dimensional scale that assesses the severity of fear of COVID-19. A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach a value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (r = 0.481, p < 0.001) and stress (r = 0.389, p < 0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-M’s properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods. It therefore is a highly crucial and timely addition to the psychological toolkit both in operational and research settings in identifying, managing and responding to the psychological distress engendered by COVID-19.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Kamu, Assis; Hambali, Nurfarah Lydia Binti; Mun, Ho Chong; Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin; Mohamed, Noor Hassline; Ayu, Friska; Rahim, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul; Omar, Azizan; Jeffree, Mohd Saffree","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00355-4","20200703",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"“I feel like death on legs”: COVID-19 isolation and mental health","Abstract This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies. Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic. None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse. Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories. The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war. In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on. Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies. I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month. The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015). The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others. The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19.","Herat, Manel","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Modified Bhramari Pranayama in Covid 19 Infection","The Coronavirus (2019-Cov-2) infection Covid-19 is highly contagious caused by single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) with nucleocapsid and spreading widely all across the world and responsible for more than 3.6 million morbidity and 0.25 million mortality No specific treatment is available till date. The clinical symptoms are mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure involving. Kidney, Liver and Heart along with coagulopathies. During 2004 (SARS-CoV) pandemic role of nitric oxide in its management is well demonstrated. Nitric Oxide (NO) reversed pulmonary hypertension. Improved severe hypoxia and shortened the stay in ICU and ventilatory support. Nitric Oxide increased the survival rate. The genetic composition of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is almost similar to Covid-19, thus indicates good chances of effectiveness or enhancement in results by Nitric Oxide along with other modes in treatment of Covid-19. It has been proved by studies by serendipity humming increases NO Expression dramatically.It is estimated that humming increases the endogenous generation of nitric oxide level by 15-fold. Hypoxia in ARD Syndrome leads to blood coagulation by depression of body defence anticoagulatory and fibrolytic properties along with metabolic acidosis.

"Frontline nurses’ burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. METHODS: A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. FINDINGS: On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. INTERPRETATION: The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.","HU, Deying; KONG, Yue; LI, Wengang; HAN, Qiuying; ZHANG, Xin; ZHU, Li Xia; WAN, Su Wei; LIU, Zuofeng; SHEN, Qu; YANG, Jingqiu; HE, Hong-Gu; ZHU, Jiemin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424","20200627",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19: Concerns and behaviours in Croatia","OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty that has heightened fear and worry worldwide, thus elevating the potential for a growth in anxiety. This study aims to examine changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. These changes were examined with respect to gender and family circumstances. DESIGN: The repeated cross-sectional data were conducted over two time points over the 3 weeks (N (1) = 888; N (2) = 966). METHODS: Participants completed online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate dramatic increase in concern and safety behaviours among participants during the 3 weeks between the first identified case and the first fatality. The results suggest that parents, and mothers especially, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. People with chronic health conditions also expressed greater concern and safety behaviour than healthy participants, but with small effect size. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of developing clear guidelines for alleviating the negative effects on mental health through effective communication strategies that minimize fear and emphasize positive behavioural change. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? In times of pandemic, people react with elevated levels of anxiety and some will adjust their behaviours in order to protect themselves as well as their family and friends. Some of the measures introduced to protect the spread of the COVID-19 disease have induced an atmosphere of fear, which in turn can lead to an increase in maladaptive anxiety and a greater burden on mental health. What does this study add? By conducting the research in two waves representing two critical time points in the developing COVID-19 situation in Croatia, we were able to trace a large increase in anxiety levels and safety behaviours among the general population. There is a discordance between those who are at most risk from serious consequences of the disease and those who are at greatest risk for maladaptive anxiety. Parents, and mothers in particular, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. Lockdown measures have allowed us to ensure the safety of those vulnerable for serious COVID-19 illness. Now, we must focus on preserving the mental health of our whole community.","Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Jokic-Begic, Natasa","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12425","20200516",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Phenomenon of depression and anxiety related to precautions for prevention among population during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Kurdistan Region of Iraq: based on questionnaire survey","PURPOSE: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has swept the world, causing widespread burden and increasingly hospitalizations. Researchers from around the world have tried to study the virus and its effect with more precision in various fields. The purpose of this study is to identify levels of anxiety and depression with regard to precautionary for prevention of COVID-19, and to identify the relationship between demographic variables and both depression and anxiety. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study; data were collected by questionnaire via a mobile phone application in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq from 25 March, 2020 to 5 April, 2020. The sample size was 894 after deleting 20 cases because of duplication. The questionnaire consists of three main parts; part one is related to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, the second and third parts consist of items related to depression and anxiety about COVID-19 using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = of course no, 2 = no , 3 = normal for me, 4 = yes, and 5 = of course yes). Data was analyzed using SPSS V.25. RESULTS: The majority of the participants were from Erbil (58.8%), most of them were male (58.4%); nearly 21.2% preferred quarantine and 41.7% chose curfew as a best way to to avoid being infected by COVID-19. Most of the participants had depression because of people's lack of knowledge about how to protect themselves from the virus (88.14%), while the majority of them had anxiety concerning shopping and contact with infected people (97%) and financial problems (97%). Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than did males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was no significant association between other variables and depression and anxiety CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated that the majority of participants were depressed and had anxiety about COVID-19. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety.

"What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?","Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018","20200428",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"COVID-19 leads to jump in people seeking MH help in NYC","It's a stressful time to be a New Yorker. People are stuck at home, worrying about their health, their family and their paycheck, Spectrum News New York 1 reported April 13. “We are seeing a lot of calls related to anxiety and stress that people are experiencing today,” said Matt Kudish, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City. The organization says the number of callers seeking help has jumped 60% over the last few weeks, and that conversations now last about 15 minutes longer than average. The city says it's also seeing an increase in demand.

"Guidance for the Treatment and Management of COVID-19 Among People with Intellectual Disabilities","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing world crisis and people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are vulnerable due to disparity in healthcare provision and physical and mental health multimorbidity. While most people will develop mild symptoms upon contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), some will develop serious complications. The aim of this study is to present guidelines for the care and treatment of people with IDs during the COVID-19 pandemic for both community teams providing care to people with IDs and inpatient psychiatric settings. The guidelines cover specific issues associated with hospital passports, individual COVID-19 care plans, the important role of families and carers, capacity to make decisions, issues associated with social distancing, ceiling of care/treatment escalation plans, mental health and challenging behavior, and caring for someone suspected of contracting or who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 within community or inpatient psychiatric settings. We have proposed that the included conditions recommended by Public Health England to categorize someone as high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 should also include mental health and challenging behavior. There are specific issues associated with providing care to people with IDs and appropriate action must be taken by care providers to ensure that disparity of healthcare is addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that our guidance is focused upon healthcare delivery in England and invite others to augment our guidance for use in other jurisdictions.","Alexander, Regi; Ravi, Ambiga; Barclay, Helene; Sawhney, Indermeet; Chester, Verity; Malcolm, Vicki; Brolly, Kate; Mukherji, Kamalika; Zia, Asif; Tharian, Reena; Howell, Andreana; Lane, Tadhgh; Cooper, Vivien; Langdon, Peter E.","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12352","20200610",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Comprehensive review of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province and has rapidly spread all over the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized it as a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The number of people diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide crossed the one million mark on April 2, 2020; two million mark on April 15, 2020; three million mark on April 27,2020 and the four million mark on May 9,2020. Despite containment efforts, more than 187 countries have been affected with more than 4, 178,346 cases in the world with maximum being in USA (1, 347,936) followed by 227,436 in Spain and 224, 422 in United Kingdom as of May, 2020. COVID-19 is the latest threat to face mankind cutting across geographical barriers in a rapidly changing landscape. This review provides an update on a rapidly evolving global pandemic. As we face the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, this is a stark reminder to invest in population health, climate change countermeasures, a global health surveillance system and effective research into identifying pathogens, their treatment and prevention and effective health delivery systems.","Chauhan, Shaylika","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bj.2020.05.023","20200601",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental health in elderly Spanish people in times of COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. RESULTS: 1639 [150 (9.2%) aged =60] participants completed the survey. The =60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the <60 group [3.02 (3.28) vs. 4.30 (4.93)]; and lower mean (SD) ASDI scores than the <60 group [3.68 (3.20) vs. 4.45 (3.06)]. There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: Older people has shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women. Economic loss and substance use should be monitored to guarantee the emotional well-being of the elderly.","García-Fernández, Lorena; Romero-Ferreiro, Verónica; López-Roldán, Pedro David; Padilla, Sergio; Rodriguez-Jimenez, Roberto","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.027","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"When Stay-at-Home Orders Leave Victims Unsafe at Home: Exploring the Risk and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel coronavirus pandemic (hereafter COVID-19) is likely to have unprecedented impacts on the incidence and impacts of crime and violence globally. This includes impacts to the risk, consequences, and decision-making of women experiencing violence by an intimate partner (hereafter IPV). Most importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the risk of IPV is likely to differentially impact vulnerable populations, including minority women and those with long histories of victimization and mental health issues. This review paper explores the potential short- and long-term implications of COVID-19 on the risk of IPV, highlighting some of the most recent preliminary data. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, record levels of male unemployment, added stressors in the home, including the care and home schooling of children, and the social distancing measures required by the epidemiological response, may serve to undermine the decades of progress made in keeping women and children safe at home. Victim police reporting, help-seeking decisions, and social service utilization during the pandemic are likely to be impacted by stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for providing safety planning and self-care for victims and their children.","Kaukinen, Catherine","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09533-5","20200606",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Grief and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults","In few periods in human history have bereavement and grief been on so many people's minds as they are today. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. Among other mental health problems, we will likely see an increase in prolonged grief disorder. In this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of COVID-19, especially among older persons. We suggest ways we might mitigate this emerging problem.","Goveas, Joseph S.; Shear, M.

"Illinois rolls out COVID-19 MH crisis hotline as cases climb","After another deadly 24 hours in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a new program to connect scared and depressed Illinois residents to badly needed mental health services, Block Club Chicago reported April 11. In the 24 hours in question, 81 people died from COVID-19 and 1,293 new confirmed cases were reported. Hoping to help those in need of mental and physical health care during the crisis, the state has created programs that will help people from afar. Call4Calm, a free emotional support text line, was created to serve Illinois residents “swimming in the stress and uncertainty” caused by COVID-19, Pritzker said. To connect with a counselor, people can text “TALK” to 552020 or text “HABLAR” to the same number for counseling in Spanish. Users will remain anonymous, and the state has partnered with mental health organizations to have counselors respond. Once a resident texts the hotline, they'll get a call from a licensed counselor within 24 hours. The program was announced as the state reached 19,180 confirmed COVID-19 cases, said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32329","20200417",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Electroconvulsive therapy protocol adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, electroconvulsive therapy units have had to confront challenges such as the infectious hazard due to aerosol-generating ventilation, or the lack of staff and material resources. Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations’ guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. RESULTS: The protocol includes the following main areas: 1) ECT unit's structural and functional; 2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; 3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); 4) management of COVID-19 cases; and 5) protocol assessment. LIMITATIONS: The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol. This proposal may be used as a reference.","Gil-Badenes, Joaquín; Valero, Ricard; Valentí, Marc; Macau, Elisabet; Bertran, Maria Jesús; Claver, Gerard; Bioque, Miquel; Baeza, Inmaculada; Salvadó, Anna Bastidas; Mencia, María Lombraña; Pacchiarotti, Isabella; Bernardo, Miquel; Vieta, Eduard","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.051","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The harsh realities of personal fears and severe challenges to our mental health evoked by both the United States presidency of Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic are described initially. Then, a number of self-care practices that are consistent with the basic values of humanistic psychology and that we can undertake to help us meet these harsh realities are illustrated. Next, the author describes his own personal engagement and self-care in the world of progressive politics and humanistic psychology in the context of the Resisting Trump movement. The article concludes with the author suggesting that perhaps it may be worthwhile for politically like-minded others to also consider finding ways of merging their progressive politics with humanistic psychology in order to enhance their self-care through these turbulent times in the Trump/Coronavirus era.","Benjamin, Elliot","https://www.doi.org/10.1177/0022167820934226","20200615",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"DEA allows buprenorphine inductions based on telephone only","Last week, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA)–waived prescribers can treat new patients with buprenorphine based on a telephone call only. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), enforced by the DEA, requires all new patients being treated with controlled substances to have an in-person — or, for now, telemedicine — physical exam. Now, however, because of the coexisting COVID-19 pandemic and opioid overdose crisis, the DEA has dropped this requirement. This follows the decision of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to allow exemptions from the OTP take-home regulations allowing stable patients to be given 14 or 28 days of methadone doses, instead of coming in more frequently (see DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID-19, ADAW March 23, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32664).","Knopf, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32680","20200403",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Enfermement carcéral, confinement socio-sanitaire et moyens d’évasionDanser sa peine et au-delà…","Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing covid-19 pandemic are compared through the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women’s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being.

"Case report of a patient with suspected COVID-19 with depression and fever in an epidemic stress environment","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of suspected cases, confirmed cases and those who passed away from the virus has been reported in major media and the internet, and has caused a high degree of tension. In addition, people’s outdoor activities have been limited, making it more difficult to find outlets for releasing stress. Under this situation, some people began to experience emotions of anxiety and depression. This article reports a case of depression with fever caused by the stress tension of the pandemic. The patient was highly suspected to have contracted COVID-19. The reported patient, who had a history of depression and had been to Wuhan to attend an exam, showed obvious pre-exam anxiety under the epidemic situation, which gradually increased the patient's pressure and then caused some adverse symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, sweating and a reoccurrent fever. Local community authorities paid close attention to him and later sent him to a general hospital in Jingmen for quarantine and treatment, as he was suspected of having COVID-19. After being hospitalised for half a month, he was ruled out from having ‘COVID-19’ and was cured of depression and discharged from the hospital. From this case, we can realise that, under the situation of the epidemic, people are easily prone to insomnia, anxiety and even depression. As clinicians in general hospitals, especially when encountering large emergencies, we must carefully inquire about the patient’s medical history while strengthening our understanding of psychiatric knowledge to improve the recognition rate for depression.","Fu, Rui; Zhang, Yueqin","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100218","20200531",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. FINDINGS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. INTERPRETATION: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.","Zhu, Zhou; Xu, Shabei; Wang, Hui; Liu, Zheng; Wu, Jianhong; Li, Guo; Miao, Jinfeng; Zhang, Chenyan; Yang, Yuan; Sun, Wenzhe; Zhu, Suiqiang; Fan, Yebin; Chen, Yuxi; Hu, Junbo; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Wei","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443","20200624",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The result of the analysis for the study model indicated that there was a mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. Eliminating uncertainty from the fear of COVID-19 will contribute to reducing depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing positivity.","Bakioglu, Fuad; Korkmaz, Ozan; Ercan, Hülya","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00331-y","20200528",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Is investing in religious institutions a viable pathway to reduce mortality in the population?","There is established and consistent findings from epidemiologic studies, among individuals, that religion— broadly assessed through frequency of attending worship services—is associated with lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality attributed to suicide, alcohol, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Religious norms, social support, character, virtue, compassion, love, generosity, and religious community are among some mechanisms purported to explain lower mortality, on aggregate. The religious ecology or characteristics of religion within an area or geographic level (e.g., county, ZIP-code, country), has been linked with overall and cause-specific mortality, but directions of findings are mixed. Mechanisms to explain the links between the religious ecology and mortality included social integration, civic engagement, and social control. The manuscript (SSM-D-19-03928R2) adds a fresh and timely perspective by investigating another mechanism: investment in local healthcare spending. The study found some support of an indirect association from county-level religious denominational composition, through investments in health spending, on Black and White all-cause mortality rates. Should society or government invest finances in religious institutions to indirectly improve population health? This work adds evidence to debate that question. Future work on the topic will need to address several conceptual and methodological challenges. Conceptually, is investigating the market share of religious denominations (i.e., % Catholics vs % Protestants) relevant today given diversity in population and declining trends of worship attendance? Is mortality the most relevant for moving policy or should the focus be on well-being? Methodologically, are there alternate observable measures religious investments/spending in the local economy? Mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities for social epidemiology research on this topic are discussed.","Ransome, Yusuf","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113106","20200608",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"The Mortality and Psychological Burden Caused by Response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a Hypothesis and a Crude Estimation","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in that country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands for the period of 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. To support the hypothesis on the effect of COVID-19 curbing measures on mental health, we performed literature search on quarantine policy during precious SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Tisler, Anna","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Risk Factors Associated with Mental Illness in Hospital Discharged Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11-22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.","Liu, Dong; Baumeister, Roy F.; Veilleux, Jennifer C.; Chen, Caixia; Liu, Wenjun; Yue, Yongjie; Zhang, Shi","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297","20200713",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 to March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression in 1,103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68%-46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and currently smoking (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower quality of life compared to those without (F((1,1103))=423.83, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Depression is common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses’ quality of life, a heightened awareness and early treatment of depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.","An, Ying; Yang, Yuan; Wang, Aiping; Li, Yue; Zhang, Qinge; Cheung, Teris; Ungvari, Gabor S.; Qin, Ming-Zhao; An, Feng-Rong; Xiang, Yu-Tao","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data","Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.","Bartoszewicz, Jakub M.; Seidel, Anja; Renard, Bernhard Y.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925354","20200130",NA,"BioRxiv; MedRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Adoption of telemedicine services by substance abuse treatment facilities in the US","OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in licensed substance use treatment facilities' adoption of telemedicine and how adoption varies across local factors, including county-level drug overdose rates, urbanicity measures, and state policy laws. METHODS: We analyzed data (2016–2019) from the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Our main outcome was telemedicine use by a treatment facility. We also captured independent variables from other datasets, including estimated county-level drug poisoning deaths and state-level telemedicine policies. We estimated a multivariable logistic regression model to determine which facility characteristics were associated with offering telemedicine. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, an average of 12,334 treatment facilities were included. During this period, the unadjusted proportion of facilities offering telemedicine grew from 13.5% to 17.4% (p < 0.001). In adjusted models, rural location; offering multiple treatment settings; offering pharmacotherapy; and serving both adult and pediatric patients were associated with greater telemedicine adoption (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). DISCUSSION: Use of telemedicine is increasing steadily among substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities; however, uptake is uneven and relatively low. As such, telemedicine may be an underutilized tool to expand access to care for patients with SUDs.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Cantor, Jonathan; Huskamp, Haiden A.; Mehrotra, Ateev; Busch, Alisa; Barnett, Michael","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108060","20200623",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Briefly Noted","By the time this issue of ADAW is published, the final figures will be out. At press time, some $400 million in a $2 trillion stimulus package designed to combat economic problems from the coronavirus pandemic is going to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to Andrew Kessler, principal with Slingshot Solutions. Both the Senate and House versions allocated $400 million. The Senate bill proposed $425 million, while the House proposed $435 million. In both bills, $15 million goes to the Indian Health Service and $50 million to suicide prevention. In the Senate bill, $250 million is allocated to certified community behavioral health clinics (CCBHCs), while that number is $200 million in the House version. These clinics currently exist in only eight states, Kessler pointed out. The CCBHC money will allow states to apply for grants and put forth their own behavioral health priorities, said Kessler.

Starting April 10, every city-county health department in the state will be equipped with an iPad. Someone walk-ing in needing help can use the iPad to speak with a mental health professional. The person can take the iPad home with them to continue conversations with the provider. “There's a button on it. They hit the button and it links up to community mental health providers in their area. Someone is able to talk with them and work through it,” said Carrie Slatton-Hodges, the interim commissioner for the department. Eighty-one sites across the state will have the iPads. Because of the state's large presence of telehealth technology, Slatton-Hodges said the department has been able to continue performing 90% of services.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32321","20200410",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Pandemic brings accessible mental health care to rural Texas","The COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread fear and economic anxiety across Texas, and mental health experts and advocates say rural areas — which already had fewer providers and higher rates of suicide and drug overdoses — could see more severe mental health impacts than the state's urban areas. They are predicting a lingering wave of trauma and depression even after the pandemic's immediate effects recede and lockdowns lift, the Fort Worth Business Press reported June 9. “There's a lot of bad things happening right now because of COVID-19,” said Andy Keller, president and CEO of the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. “But in some ways, people in rural Texas have better access to health care than they'd ever had before. All the barriers to them accessing physicians across the state have been lifted.” In April, Gov. Greg Abbott temporarily waived restrictions on telehealth, allowing mental health care providers and local mental health authorities to broadly expand services and collect reimbursement for online appointments more easily. The state also implemented a mental health hotline in March that offers free over-the-phone support and provides resources and information to callers who need help.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32409","20200612",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Patients receiving in-center hemodialysis have been particularly affected by this pandemic due to their need to travel multiple times a week to receive treatment. Although patients on home dialysis are able to avoid such exposure, they face their own unique challenges. In this review, we will discuss the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic for patients on home dialysis, the impact of COVID-19 on various aspects of their care, and the resultant rapid adaptations in policy/health care delivery mechanisms with implications for the future care of home dialysis patients.","Yerram, Preethi; Misra, Madhukar","https://www.doi.org/10.1053/j.ackd.2020.07.001","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Chapter 27 Emergence and Reemergence of Viral Zoonotic Diseases: Concepts and Factors of Emerging and Reemerging Globalization of Health Threats","Abstract The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).","El Amri, Hamid; Boukharta, Mohamed; Zakham, Fathiah; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Panic and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people: An online pilot survey early in the outbreak","Abstract Background: Precisely how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health worldwide is currently poorly understood. The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. Limitations: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Conclusion: Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Islam, Md.

"Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of insomnia symptoms among Chinese adolescents and young adults affected by the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12–29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. RESULTS: Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students’ projections of trends in COVID-19. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a risk factor for insomnia symptoms; as such, the government must devote more attention to sleep disorders in this patient population while combating COVID-19.","Zhou, Shuang-Jiang; Wang, Lei-Lei; Yang, Rui; Yang, Xing-Jie; Zhang, Li-Gang; Guo, Zhao-Chang; Chen, Jin-Cheng; Wang, Jing-Qi; Chen, Jing-Xu","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001","20200606",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death.

"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: Early outpatient experiences and implications for the future","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U.S. healthcare landscape. Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact. In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19. We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual. Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.","Chen, Justin A.; Chung, Wei-Jean; Young, Sarah K.; Tuttle, Margaret C.; Collins, Michelle B.; Darghouth, Sarah L.; Longley, Regina; Levy, Raymond; Razafsha, Mahdi; Kerner, Jeffrey C.; Wozniak, Janet; Huffman, Jeff C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002","20200709",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID -19 to patients with SMI and identify its relation with their COVID-19 knowledge. A cross-sectional telephonic survey among 132 patients with SMI who were clinically stable before the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. A 23 item interview proforma comprising of self-reported knowledge related to COVID-19 by patients and their illness and treatment status from their caregivers. Eleven patients were completely not aware of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Three fourth of patients were not worried about getting COVID-19 and lacks adequate knowledge to identify symptoms. Two-third of patients lacked adequate knowledge of precautionary measures against COVID-19. One out of five patients lacked knowledge of the mode of transmission and stopped their psychiatric treatment. Thirty percent showed features of relapse of symptoms during this lockdown period. In multivariate regression analysis, patients from lower socioeconomic status, low literacy levels, with inadequate social support showed less knowledge related to COVID-19.

"Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a Large Academic Medical Center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness","BACKGROUND: Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. METHODS: We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, prospectively written by third parties during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay greater than 72 h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychometric testing with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores, obtained within one week of ICU admission, was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS: From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up (n = 18) in the diary intervention group and (n = 17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. CONCLUSIONS: Results from psychometric testing demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in care – patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier—prolonged psychological morbidity.

"Validation and Psychometric Properties of the Japanese Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Among Adolescents","In the context of the global outbreak of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to explore the effects of this pandemic on the mental health of adolescents. The present study aims to adapt and validate a Japanese-version Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with a sample of adolescent students from Japan. To this end, the Japanese-version FCV-19S, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS) were administered to a sample of Japanese adolescents in schools. The results of statistical analyses revealed that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a bi-factor model consisting of the emotional response factor and the physiological response factor, with high reliability (emotional: a = .71; physiological: a = .82). Constructive validity was shown by the significant positive correlation between the GAD-7 and emotional (r = .11) and physiological response (r = .25), between PHQ-A and physiological response (r = .19), and between both factors and the PVDS subscale (rs > .16). Taken together, these results indicate that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a high internal consistency and a moderately good construct validity.","Masuyama, Akihiro; Shinkawa, Hiroki; Kubo, Takahiro","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00368-z","20200713",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Aging and Feeling Valued Versus Expendable During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: a Review and Commentary of Why Mattering Is Fundamental to the Health and Well-Being of Older Adults","The current commentary and review examines the potentially protective role of feelings of mattering among elderly people during typical times and the current atypical times associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Mattering is the feeling of being important to others in ways that give people the sense that they are valued and other people care about them. We contrast this feeling with messages of not mattering and being expendable and disposable due to ageism, gaps in the provision of care, and apparently economically focused positions taken during the pandemic that disrespect the value, worth, and merits of older persons. We provide a comprehensive review of past research on individual differences in mattering among older adults and illustrate the unique role of mattering in potentially protecting older adults from mental health problems. Mattering is also discussed in terms of its links with loneliness and physical health. This article concludes with a discussion of initiatives and interventions that can be modified and enhanced to instill a sense of mattering among older adults. Key directions for future research are also highlighted along with ways to expand the mattering concept to more fully understand and appreciate the relevance of mattering among older adults.","Flett, Gordon L.; Heisel, Marnin J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00339-4","20200615",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and pets: When pandemic meets panic","Abstract As the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads globally with devastating effects on human health, pets are also becoming unnecessary victims amidst the pandemic panic. Many have been reluctantly left home alone by owners who have been forced to temporarily evacuate their homes. And, although no evidence exists to indicate that they can either transmit the virus or develop its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear among the public that pets might play a role in spreading COVID-19 has resulted in pets being abandoned or even killed. This article outlines some of the ways in which the current pandemic has negatively impacted the welfare of pets. It also highlights the relationships between animal, human, and environmental health, as well as the importance of taking a collaborative transdisciplinary One Health approach to help prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Parry, Nicola M.A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100090","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the Covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.","El Haj, Mohamad; Altintas, Emin; Chapelet, Guillaume; Kapogiannis, Dimitrios; Gallouj, Karim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200713",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Mental Health, and Preventive Behaviours Across Pregnant Women and Husbands: An Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling","The present cross-sectional study examined the actor-partner interdependence effect of fear of COVID-19 among Iranian pregnant women and their husbands and its association with their mental health and preventive behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A total of 290 pregnant women and their husbands (N = 580) were randomly selected from a list of pregnant women in the Iranian Integrated Health System and were invited to respond to psychometric scales assessing fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives’ actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety. Moreover, a husband actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Additionally, there were significant partner effects observed for both the pregnant wives and their husbands concerning all outcomes. The present study used a cross-sectional design and so is unable to determine the mechanism or causal ordering of the effects. Also, the data are mainly based on self-reported measures which have some limitations due to its potential for social desirability and recall biases. Based on the findings, couples may benefit from psychoeducation that focuses on the effect of mental health problems on pregnant women and the foetus.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Imani, Vida; Lin, Chung-Ying; Timpka, Toomas; Broström, Anders; Updegraff, John A.; Årestedt, Kristofer; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00340-x","20200611",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Rethinking ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’: the developmental paediatrician’s COVID-19 response","While terms such as ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’ used amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may serve a practical purpose, they also pose a risk of obstructing our view of the harmful indirect health consequences of this crisis. SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other ‘essential’ aspects of children’s health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as ‘essential’ during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now. Video conferences and phone calls are ‘essential’ instruments we can use to continue to provide quality care for our patients.","Fung, Alastair; Ricci, M Florencia","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa077","20200620",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Experiences of American older adults with pre-existing depression during the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-city, mixed-methods study","OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: During the first two months of the pandemic, we interviewed participants with a semi-structured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. We also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: (1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. (2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. (3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. (4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. (5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Megan E.; Brown, Patrick J.; Karp, Jordan F.; Lenard, Emily; Cameron, Flor; Dawdani, Alicia; Lavretsky, Helen; Miller, J.

"L’optimisme et COVID-19: une ressource pour soutenir les personnes en situation de confinement?","Abstract This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Tarquinio, Cyril; Tarquinio, Camille","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200605",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"North Carolina frees up $30 million for BH during COVID-19 crisis","North Carolina's seven regional managed care agencies for behavioral health are receiving $30 million so they can keep a variety of programs running during the COVID-19 crisis, Carolina Public Press reported March 31. The money, which an N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said represented unused Medicaid funds, has been shifted to the state's seven local management entities/managed care organizations, commonly called LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high-quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID-19 cases rises.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32310","20200403",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Cutting Cubes Out of Fog: The Whole View of Design","Abstract In this article we argue that the field of design evolved to include helping organizations address complex problems in the face of uncertainty, but it has yet to build knowledge in a way that formalizes the various activities embraced by the field. We use our relationship with the school of public health at Harvard to illustrate the advantages of formalizing design knowledge more explicitly. We introduce the Whole View model to provide the field of design with a tentative structure for its knowledge that could make it easier for design and other fields to work together. We situate the model in the context of different types of design education, and show examples of how the Whole View provides a structure for teaching, research, and practice. We conclude by introducing a new agenda for design centered on the well-being of people, organizations, and the natural environment, with health, happiness, and prosperity as the levers driving change.","Whitney, Patrick; Nogueira, André","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2020.04.001","20200831",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Gambling harm is everybody's business: A public health approach and call to action","There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a ‘health in all policy’ approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a ‘whole council’ approach.","Johnstone, P.; Regan, M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.010","20200717",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Effect of state regulatory environments on advanced psychiatric nursing practice()","The first key message in the landmark Future of Nursing report is that “Nurses should practice to the full extent of their education and training” (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Although there has been significant progress across states to remove or diminish barriers to the exercise of full scope of practice by advanced practice registered nurses (APRN), state regulations continue to unnecessarily restrict APRN practice in most of the United States. This article integrates data from studies that examine how state and local regulation affects psychiatric mental health APRN practice with the literature on how state scope of practice regulation affects the size and distribution of the broader APRN workforce, access to care, health care costs and prices, and innovation in health care service delivery.

A total of 1,172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8–18 years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Yumei; Duan, Wenjie; Chen, Zheng","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105235","20200708",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in a US College Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted college students’ coursework, stress levels, and perceived health. Various estimates indicate that high proportions of college students have experienced increased amounts of stress (Dziech, Inside Higher Education, 2020; Hartocollis, New York Times, 2020), yet other sources indicate that many college students respond to these changes with resilience (Kelley, Cornell Chronicle, 2020). A method for assessing student anxiety regarding the pandemic is thus needed. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) (Ahorsu et al., International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 2020) is a seven-item scale which has been validated and shown to possess good psychometric qualities in studies of participants from multiple countries. The current study used a cross-sectional convenience sample of US college student participants (n = 237) and found that the FCV-19S has high reliability and validity as demonstrated by its internal consistency and strong one-factor solution. Scores on the FCV-19S were positively correlated with anxiety for students who were married or of Asian descent. Additionally, the FCV-19S was only moderately correlated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), suggesting that the FCV-19S may bring added utility to research and clinical practice with populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perz, Catherine A.; Lang, Brent A.; Harrington, Rick","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00356-3","20200625",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

RESULTS: The prolonged confinement is evidently related to psychological damage, considering that individuals would be subjected to stressors for a longer period of time . In some cases, these psychic losses lasted for many months after the end of this confinement CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop and implement actions to minimize the population psychological distress in meeting the needs of the communities affected by COVID-19 Thus, as it occurred in China, it is necessary that the other affected nations promote the publication of regulations that guide the implementation of mental health services and the allocation of resources, in order to ensure that individuals are monitored by competent professionals, thus reducing the psychological damage that can be motivated by the social isolation period during the quarantine.","de Lima, Carlos Victor Chaves; Cândido, Estelita Lima; da Silva, José Arinelson; Albuquerque, Letícia Viana; Soares, Lívia de Menezes; do Nascimento, Mayara Maciel; de Oliveira, Sara Alves; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.063","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological influence of Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the general public, medical workers and patients with mental disorders and its countermeasures","Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency (PHEIC) of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by (WHO) of the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020 showed that general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg).

"Navigating crisis from the backseat? How top managers can support radical change initiatives by middle managers","Abstract We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.","Heyden, Mariano L.M.; Wilden, Ralf; Wise, Chelsea","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024","20200731",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Circulating endocannabinoid concentrations in grieving adults","Bereavement is one of the most intense, distressing, and traumatic events an elderly person will experience. The symptom responses to bereavement vary, particularly during the first year. However, the neurobiology underlying the symptom variance in grief is poorly understood. The endocannabinoid signaling (ECS) system is stress-responsive; mounting evidence implicates abnormalities in the central ECS system could contribute to psychopathology. The current study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the ECS is abnormal in grief, using circulating eCB concentrations as a biomarker of central ECS. A predominantly older sample of grief participants, within 13 months following the death of a loved one, and healthy comparison (HC) participants were studied. Associations of circulating eCBs with symptom variance in grievers were also examined. A total of 61 (grief: n = 44; HC: n = 17) adults completed cross-sectional clinical assessments and a fasting blood draw. Assessments included the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale; the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; and the Hamilton Anxiety scale. Serum eCB concentrations (i.e., N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) were quantified using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative to HC participants, grievers had significantly elevated serum AEA but similar 2-AG concentrations. In grievers, serum AEA concentrations were positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, but only in those with low grief symptoms. These novel findings indicate that elevated circulating eCB concentrations are found following bereavement. The eCB signaling response varies based on the degree of grief severity. Circulating eCB measures may have the potential to serve as biomarkers of prolonged grief disorder.","Harfmann, Elisabeth J.; McAuliffe, Timothy L.; Larson, Eric R.; Claesges, Stacy A.; Sauber, Garrett; Hillard, Cecilia J.; Goveas, Joseph S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104801","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression symptom, and the Demands for Psychological Knowledge and Interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large Cross-Sectional Study","BACKGROUND: : Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. METHODS: : A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. RESULTS: : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P=0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P=0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). LIMITATIONS: : All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. CONCLUSIONS: : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.","Wang, Zheng-He; Yang, Hai-Lian; Yang, Yun-Qing; Liu, Dan; Li, Zhi-Hao; Zhang, Xi-Ru; Zhang, Yu-Jie; Shen, Dong; Chen, Pei-Liang; Song, Wei-Qi; Wang, Xiao-Meng; Wu, Xian-Bo; Yang, Xing-Fen; Mao, Chen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.034","20200702",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"A Feminist Perspective on COVID-19 and the Value of Care Work Globally","The shared response to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that the vast majority of society believes human well-being - not economic growth - should be at the center of policy. COVID-19 exposes the foundational role of care work, both paid and unpaid, to functioning societies and economies. Focusing on ""production"" instead of the sustainable reproduction of human life devalues care work and those who perform it. Women's physical and mental health, and the societies that rely on them, are at stake. When these policies are formulated, the field of feminist economics has valuable lessons for mitigating hardships as countries navigate the related economic fallout. A comprehensive response to the COVID-19 crisis must recognize this gendered work as an integral part of the economic system that promotes human well-being for all.","Bahn, Kate; Cohen, Jennifer; van der Meulen Rodgers, Yana","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/gwao.12459","20200507",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Gaucher Disease patients in Spain: Time to reconsider home-based therapies?","OBJECTIVE: An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here. PATIENTS & METHODS: The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent. RESULTS: 110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were = 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients treated at hospitals reported dose interruptions.

"Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. METHOD: Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. RESULTS: In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the protective effect of PMH in extraordinary situations such as the current outbreak of COVID-19.","Brailovskaia, Julia; Margraf, Jürgen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002","20200628",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Managing Mass Fatalities during COVID-19: Lessons for Promoting Community Resilience During Global Pandemics","In the United States and around the world, COVID-19 represents a mass fatality incident, as there are more bodies than can be handled using existing resources. Although the management and disposition of bodies is distressing and heartrending, it is a task that local, state, and federal governments must plan for and respond to collaboratively with the private sector and faith-based community. When mass fatalities are mismanaged, there are grave emotional and mental health consequences that can delay recovery and undermine community resilience. Using insights from one of the author's mass fatality management research during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, this article explores how mass fatalities are being managed in response to COVID-19. Based on the researcher's findings a decade ago, it is apparent that many lessons have not been learnt. This article concludes by providing governments with practical lessons on how to manage mass fatalities to facilitate and promote community resilience.","Entress, Rebecca; Tyler, Jenna; Sadiq, Abdul-Akeem","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/puar.13232","20200519",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Introduction: changing cultures of speed","This chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century, along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed. In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of ‘health’ in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public’s negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the ‘fast movement’ has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.","Tranter, Paul; Tolley, Rodney","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815316-1.00001-0","20200626",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Mental Health Crises in Rural and Remote Australia: An Assessment of Direct Medical Costs of Air Medical Retrievals and the Implications for the Societal Burden","OBJECTIVE: Adequate mental health service provision in rural and remote Australian communities is problematic because of the tyranny of distance. The Royal Flying Doctor Service provides air medical retrieval for people in rural and remote areas. The economic impact on both the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the public hospital system for mental health–related air medical retrievals is unknown. We aimed to estimate the direct medical costs associated with air medical retrievals and subsequent hospitalizations for mental and behavioral disorders for the 2017 calendar year. METHODS: All patients with a primary working diagnosis of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Version, Australian Modification F00 to F99 (mental and behavioral disorders) who underwent an air medical retrieval were included in this cost analysis. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition, Australian Modification codes were mapped to Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Group codes, with hospital costs applied from the National Hospital Cost Data Collection (2016/2017). All costs are reported in 2017 Australian dollars (AUDs). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two primary evacuations and 926 interhospital transfers occurred with an in-flight diagnosis of F00 to F99, most commonly psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizotypal disorders. The total direct medical costs were estimated to be AUD $20,070,527. Costs for primary evacuations accounted for 13% (AUD $2,611,260), with the majority of this associated with the subsequent hospital admission (AUD $1,770,139). Similarly, the majority of the costs associated with interhospital transfers (total costs = AUD $17,459,267) were also related to hospital costs (AUD $13,569,187). CONCLUSION: Direct medical costs associated with air medical retrievals for people experiencing a mental health crisis are substantial. The majority of costs are associated with hospital admission and treatment; however, the indirect (loss of productivity) and intangible (quality of life) costs are likely to be far greater.","Gardiner, Fergus W.; de Graaff, Barbara; Bishop, Lara; Campbell, Julie A; Mealing, Susan; Coleman, Mathew","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amj.2020.06.010","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"El impacto de la Gran Recesión en la salud mental en España","The objective of this article is to identify the effects of the Great Recession on the mental health of people residing in Spain. After presenting a conceptual framework on the mechanisms through which economic crises affect mental health, we describe the main results of 45 papers identified in our search. Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; López-Varcárcel, Beatriz González; Pérez, Patricia Barber; Peña-Longobardo, Luz María; Garrido, Rosa M.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: : The data were collected online and anonymously, during lockdown; they included 1104 females (aged 22.08±4,96) and 431 males (aged 22.35±3.11). The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios RESULTS: : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2-5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20-68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. DISCUSSION: : The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs.

"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","Noorbhai, Habib","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200711",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

Evans Jr., Ph.D., APA's CEO, said in a statement. “The federal government has just identified psychologists as critical, essential workers in the U.S. response to COVID-19. But this does not mean that psychologists and psychology trainees must do work in person,” he said. “Essential psychological services can, and in many cases, should be delivered through telehealth. It is critically important that psychologists are able to meet the needs of their patients and communities during this difficult time, without further increasing the risk of contagion.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32297","20200327",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Isolation of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: An ethical, legal, and practical challenge","Psychiatric inpatients are particularly vulnerable to the transmission and effects of COVID-19. As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual's right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation. We then interrogate the practicality of currently available approaches by applying them to a series of hypothetical cases. There are currently no ‘neat’ or practicable solutions to the problem of lawfully isolating patients on mental health units, and we discuss the myriad issues with both mental health and public health law approaches to the problem. We conclude by making some suggestions to policymakers.","Brown, Christian; Keene, Alex Ruck; Hooper, Carwyn Rhys; O'Brien, Aileen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101572","20200508",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Antipsychotic-Induced Immune Dysfunction: A Consideration for COVID-19 Risk","Patients with severe mental illness are more susceptible to infections for a variety of reasons, some associated with the underlying disease and some due to environmental factors including housing insecurity, smoking, poor access to healthcare, and medications used to treat these disorders. This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23®. These data indicate that short- to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.","May, Meghan; Slitzky, Matthew; Rostama, Bahman; Barlow, Deborah; Houseknecht, Karen L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100097","20200623",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Governing Under Pressure: German Policy Making During the Coronavirus Crisis","The global threat of the coronavirus pandemic has forced policy makers to react quickly with totally new policy-making approaches under conditions of uncertainty. This article focuses on such crisis-driven policy learning, examining how the experiences of China and South Korea as early responder states influenced the subsequent coronavirus crisis management in Germany. The first reaction of the German core executive was the quick concentration of decision-making power at the top of the political hierarchy. Asserting the prerogatives of the executive included the radical simplification of the relationship between politics, law and science. State actors took emergency measures by recourse to a single piece of legislation—the ‘infection protection law’ (Infektionsschutzgesetz)—overriding other elements of the legal order. They also limited the government’s use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government’s crisis measures. Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition—namely public willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health—that is absent in the German case.","Dostal, Jörg Michael","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/1467-923x.12865","20200708",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

We outline several issues stemming from or exacerbated by the pandemic and offer suggestions for future research to address the mental health needs of those impacted. Our suggestions focus on five domains: (a) the health and well-being of helping professionals, (b) the infodemic, (c) discrimination and minority stress, (d) spiritual and existential dynamics in mental health and (e) couple and family stress and resilience. We aim to provide a multi-systemic perspective of mental health and well-being in the time of COVID-19, as well as encourage current and future studies to incorporate these suggestions to advance the health and well-being of our communities through evidence-based treatment approaches.","Bell, Chance A.; Crabtree, Sarah A.; Hall, Eugene L.; Sandage, Steven J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/capr.12334","20200703",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Using air curtains to reduce short-range infection risk in consulting ward: A numerical investigation","Air curtains is promising in reducing the short-range infection risk in hospitals. To quantitatively evaluate its performance, this paper explores air curtains equipped on normal consulting desk to avoid doctor’s direct exposure to the patient exhaled pollutants. A numerical investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of supply air velocity and angle on cutting off performance. Simulation results show that the average mass fraction of exhaled pollutants decreases significantly (70%–90%) in the consulting ward, indicating satisfying performance of air curtains. Increasing supply air velocity is demonstrated to be conducive in forming full air curtains, whereas an excessively high supply air velocity may be of adverse effects by entraining exhaled flow. Besides, the supply air angle is also critical due to its coupling with supply air velocity. It is found that larger angle (0°–40°) is better where velocity is less than 3 m/s, otherwise a small angle (20°) is preferable where velocity is larger than 3 m/s. Exhaled flow could be well suppressed at the supply air angle 20° but moves over air curtains at 40°. This study can provide effective and intuitive guidance in applying air curtains in consulting wards.

"The putative etiology and prevention of autism","Since the initial psychological report by Leo Kanner in 1943, relatively little formal biochemical/neurological research on the cause of autism, other than peripheral searches for genomic mutations, had been carried until the end of the 20th century. As a result of studies on twin sets and the conclusion that autism was largely a hereditary defect, numerous investigations have sought various genetic faults in particular. However, such studies were able to reveal a plausible etiology for this malady in only a small percentage of instances. Key bio-molecular characteristics of this syndrome have been uncovered when the potential roles of the glia were studied in depth. Findings related to biochemical deficiencies appearing early in the newborn, such as depressed IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor #1) in neurogenesis/myelination, are becoming emphasized in many laboratories. Progress leading to timely diagnoses and subsequent prevention of central nervous system dysconnectivity now seems plausible. The tendency for an infant to develop autism may currently be determinable and preventable before irreversible psychosocial disturbances become established. These discussions about glial function will be inter-spersed with comments about their apparent relevance to autism. The concluding portion of this presentation will be a detailed review and summation of this diagnosis and prevention proposition.","Steinman, Gary","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.013","20200510",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Scottish mental health and capacity law: The normal, pandemic and ‘new normal’","Abstract A state's real commitment to its international human rights obligations is never more challenged than when it faces emergency situations. Addressing actual and potential resourcing pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, amongst other things, modifications to Scottish mental health and capacity law and the issuing of new guidance relating to associated practice. Whether these emergency or ordinary measures are invoked during the crisis there are potential implications for the rights of persons with mental illness, learning disability and dementia notably those relating to individual autonomy and dignity. This article will consider areas of particular concern but how strict adherence to the legal, ethical and human rights framework in Scotland will help to reduce the risk of adverse consequences.","Stavert, Jill; McKay, Colin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101593","20200831",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Relation of Dietary Factors with Infection and Mortality Rates of COVID-19 Across the World","OBJECTIVE: Poor dietary habits are considered to be the second-leading risk factors for mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in the world. Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and Coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had Coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500–1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: -0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: -0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: -0.176; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Hassan, A.

"Covid-19 et remaniement des défenses contre la dépression chez les soignants en Ehpad","Résumé Les réponses des Ehpad à la pandémie et au confinement actuel révèlent et amplifient les défenses habituelles des soignants contre la dépression. Le fait que le danger de mort et l’obligation d’enfermer les résidents viennent de l’extérieur, et le maniement permanent des mesures de protection physique ne suppriment pas le sentiment d’inutilité et l’angoisse de mort qu’ils tolèrent ou évitent d’ordinaire. L’auteur montre qu’ils ajoutent au contraire à leur inquiétude et par conséquent à leur besoin de parole et d’écoute. Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.

"Unexpected finding of myocardial depression in 2 healthy young patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: possible support for COVID-19-related myocarditis","COVID-19 is proving to be a devastating pandemic with both tragic economic and health consequences worldwide. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) of the lungs has been thrust into the forefront of resources that could be used in the management of COVID-19 acute care patients. However, relatively little attention has been paid to POCUS utility in assessing the heart in COVID-19 patients. Anecdotal reports suggest encounters of likely COVID-19 induced pericardial effusions and myocardial electrical dysfunction.

"Death anxiety in the time of COVID-19: theoretical explanations and clinical implications","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a surge in anxiety across the globe. Much of the public’s behavioural and emotional response to the virus can be understood through the framework of terror management theory, which proposes that fear of death drives much of human behaviour. In the context of the current pandemic, death anxiety, a recently proposed transdiagnostic construct, appears especially relevant. Fear of death has recently been shown to predict not only anxiety related to COVID-19, but also to play a causal role in various mental health conditions. Given this, it is argued that treatment programmes in mental health may need to broaden their focus to directly target the dread of death. Notably, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to produce significant reductions in death anxiety. As such, it is possible that complementing current treatments with specific CBT techniques addressing fears of death may ensure enhanced long-term symptom reduction. Further research is essential in order to examine whether treating death anxiety will indeed improve long-term outcomes, and prevent the emergence of future disorders in vulnerable populations. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To understand terror management theory and its theoretical explanation of death anxiety in the context of COVID-19. (2).. To understand the transdiagnostic role of death anxiety in mental health disorders. (3).. To understand current treatment approaches for directly targeting death anxiety, and the importance of doing so to improve long-term treatment outcomes.","Menzies, Rachel E.; Menzies, Ross G.","https://www.doi.org/10.1017/s1754470x20000215","20200611",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Mental distress in orthodontic patients during the COVID-19 epidemic","Introduction The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts the mental health of patients, health workers and the public. The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. Methods An online questionnaire type of survey was conducted on a convenien ce sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1 to 3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed the mental health related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 mental distress scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principle component analysis, k-means cluster analysis and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with statistical significance set at P<0.05. Result s: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; age 24.78 ± 6.33 years [mean ± standard deviation]). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments and Hubei residence. Types of orthodontic appliance were associated with anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concern of prolonged treatment duration. Frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. Conclusion s: Over one third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, interval from the last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Xin; Wu, Yange; Fang, Xinyi; Sun, Wei; Ding, Qin; Yi, Yating; Huang, Yanmei; Gong, Jinglei; Liu, Jin; Wang, Jun","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.07.005","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants’ demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients’ self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients’ mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9=5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7=5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI=8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients’ self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß=0.313, P<0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß=0.411, P<0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß=0.358, P=0.002) had direct effects on patients’ mental health. The disease duration (ß=0.163, P=0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß=0.101, P=0.016) also indirectly affected patients’ mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients’ mental symptoms.","Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"An Investigation of the Effect of COVID-19 on OCD in Youth in the Context of Emotional Reactivity, Experiential Avoidance, Depression and Anxiety","In addition to the serious physical and medical effects on individuals, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have short- and long-term psycho-social consequences, especially for young people. Nowadays, with psychological problems becoming more widely recognized in adolescents, it is possible that the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic will trigger various anxiety disorders, OCD and similar negative outcomes. Considering that psychological qualities such as emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance observed in adolescents may increase the risk of such psycho-social disorders, in this study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and OCD was investigated in a Turkish sample of 598 adolescents, and the mediating role of emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety in this relationship was examined. The data collection was performed online rather than in person because of the COVID-19 threat. A structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that the effect of COVID-19 fear on OCD is mediated by emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety.

"An Analysis on the Panic During COVID-19 Pandemic Through An Online Form","Abstract With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p=0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p=0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent regardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients.

We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear. Fear was related to all information sources suggesting that more information leads to higher intensity of fear – except information from the president which did not show any effect.","Jovancevic, Ana; Milicevic, Nebojša","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110216","20200625",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Online Gambling in the Midst of COVID-19: A Nexus of Mental Health Concerns, Substance Use and Financial Stress","This study examined the emerging impact of COVID-19 on gambling during the first 6 weeks of emergency measures in Ontario, Canada. A cross-sectional online survey of 2005 gamblers, including a sub-sample of 1081 online gamblers (age 18 years and older), was administered to assess risky gambling behaviours and motivations, financial impacts from COVID-19, the influence of COVID-19 on online gambling, mental health concerns and substance use. A series of odds ratio comparisons and measures of association were carried out. Results show significant likelihood of online gambling among those classified as high-risk gamblers (according to the Problem Gambling Severity Index) and those with past experience of online gambling, though migration from land-based gambling was apparent. Among high-risk online gamblers, the most predictive risk factors included moderate and severe anxiety and depression, reduced work hours, being influenced to gamble due to COVID-19, gambling under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and risky gambling motives tied to mental health concerns, including gambling because it helps with nervousness and depression, chasing gambling losses and seeking to earn income. This study has confirmed many of the risk associations presented in emerging COVID-19-related studies and past research on global economic crisis relating to gambling risk, mental health concerns and substance use. However, unlike many past studies, the present paper takes note of all of these elements holistically and provides incremental clarity on online gambling risk factors during the pandemic, specifically.","Price, Alex","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00366-1","20200713",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Stress among Health Care Professionals during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak: Cases from Online Consulting Customers","BACKGROUND: During the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, online consulting has been widely used to address mental health problems, including health care professionals (HCPs) caring for COVID-19 patients who experienced substantial psychological distress. AIM: To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using <U+03C7>(2)-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. RESULTS: The sample overall (n=34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS mean=15.71±4.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-9=5) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-7=5). Those working at intensive care units (ICUs) or in departments of respiratory medicine (RM) demonstrated significantly higher perceived stress than those at other departments (adjusted mean: 17.48±.96 vs. 13.06±1.25, p=.018, partial <U+03B7>(2)=.173). High perceived stress was most strongly associated with being depressed (beta=.486, p=.002) and working at ICUs/RM (beta=.345, p=.023). CONCLUSIONS: The psychological health status of frontline health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak warrants clinical attention. Online mental health services has played a major role although its effectiveness and barriers to its utilization require further evaluation.","Ma, Yarong; Rosenheck, Robert; He, Hongbo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102905","20200628",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Adaptation of the Bangla Version of the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale","The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) is among the first few published screening tools for assessing dysfunctional anxiety induced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The CAS was translated into the Bangla language following the International Test Commission’s guidelines for this adaptation study and placed in an online survey (N = 737, with a mean age of 26.55 (SD = 7.166 years) to assess the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the scale. Results suggested that all items had a good item discrimination index and single-factor structure with good factor loadings. The CAS Bangla version was found to have good internal consistency reliabilities, test-retest reliability, and composite reliability (= 0.7).

"Domestic violence against women and the COVID-19 pandemic: What is the role of psychiatry?","A heightened risk of domestic violence has been associated with infection-reducing measures undertaken by governments during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychiatric services can play a key role in addressing this issue by (a) addressing certain risk factors for perpetration of domestic violence through, for example, assertive identification and management of substance misuse; (b) providing support, advocacy and treatment services for victims of domestic violence; and (c) multi-agency working to strengthen medical and social responses to domestic violence. At a time like this, it is important that multi-disciplinary mental health services are strengthened, rather than depleted, in order to address the pressing issues at hand.","Gulati, Gautam; Kelly, Brendan D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101594","20200602",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Strategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinformatics techniques","The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.","Basu, Anamika; Sarkar, Anasua; Maulik, Ujjwal","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422","20200302",NA,"BioRxiv; MedRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Public behavior change, perceptions, depression, and anxiety in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 has spread rapidly and world-widely, which elicits public panic and psychological problems. Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. RESULTS: 6,261 people were included for analysis, with 3,613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1,743 in Wuhan). A majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who or whose family members were infected had much higher depression or anxiety prevalence. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak will be control by protective behaviors were associated with lower depression and anxiety prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further researches can focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify ways for better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Jing; Liu, Fangkun; Teng, Ziwei; Chen, Jindong; Zhao, Jingping; Wang, Xiaoping; Wu, Ying; Xiao, Jingmei; Wang, Ying; Wu, Renrong","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273","20200703",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Experiences and needs of caregivers of persons with dementia in India during the COVID-19 pandemic – A Qualitative Study","OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences and needs of caregivers of persons with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a city in India. DESIGN: Qualitative study using a telephonic semi-structured interview SETTING: A specialist geriatric outpatient mental health service based in a non-governmental organization in Chennai, India. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sampling of family members of persons with dementia registered in the database and seen within the previous 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-one caregivers participated. Thematic analysis of the data showed two sets of issues that the caregivers of persons with dementia faced in their experiences during the pandemic. The first set was unique to the caregivers that directly related to their caregiving role, while the second set did not relate directly to their caregiving role. These two sets also appeared to have a two-way interaction influencing each other. These issues generated needs, some of which required immediate support while others required longer-term support. The caregivers suggested several methods, such as use of video-consultations, telephone-based support and clinic-based in-person visits to meet their needs. They also wanted more services post-pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of persons with dementia had multiple needs during the pandemic. Supporting them during these times require a pragmatic multi-layered approach. Systemic changes, policies and frameworks, increased awareness, use of technology, and better access to health are necessary.","Vaitheswaran, Dr. Sridhar; Lakshminarayanan, Miss Monisha; Ramanujam, Dr. Vaishnavi; Sargunan, Dr. Subashini; Venkatesan, Miss Shreenila","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.026","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The need for ready access to scientifically sound treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is urgent, but gold-standard agonist therapy is often inaccessible. • Drug courts should help to reduce barriers to OUD therapy by offering court-supervised treatment as an alternative to criminal prosecution for certain categories of drug offenses. • Many drug courts, however, reject including the opioid agonist methadone and partial agonist buprenorphine as treatment options, often because these medicines are seen as “another form of addiction”. • Many US drug courts have steered participants to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, sometimes offering only XR-NTX and no agonist therapies. XR-NTX is very expensive in the US market and also requires a period of abstinence before it can be initiated. • Drug courts overall have had limited success in improving access to OUD treatment and other health and social services needed to achieve significant reduction in overdose death.","Csete, Joanne","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100024","20200609",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

The purpose of the legislation was to respond to the emergency situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the increase pressure placed on health services in the United Kingdom. An overview is provided of the government's rationale for the changes to Northern Ireland mental health and capacity laws, as well as exploring how they are likely to be operationalised in practice. Consideration is also given as to how such changes may impact upon existing human rights protections for persons assessed as lacking mental capacity. It is argued that it is important that regular parliamentary oversight is maintained in relation to the potential impact and consequences of such changes during the period they are in force. This should be done in order to assess whether they remain a necessary, proportionate and least restrictive response to the challenges faced in managing mental health and capacity issues in Northern Ireland during this public health emergency.","Farrell, Anne-Maree; Hann, Patrick","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101602","20200622",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation in late-life depression: A possible option for older depressed adults in need of ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVES: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an essential psychiatric service that has an important role in treating older adult patients with severe or treatment-resistant depression (TRD). During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services may be limited due to infection control measures. We report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a severe major depressive episode who had previously responded to right unilateral ECT and was treated with two modified accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols. METHODS: The two aiTBS treatment courses consisted of 8 daily sessions over five consecutive days, followed by gradual tapering, using 1800 pulses per session pre-COVID-19 (first course), and 600 pulses per session during the pandemic (second course). RESULTS: Moderate to severe baseline depressive symptoms reached remission levels after both courses. CONCLUSIONS: The 600-pulses aiTBS treatment protocol reported here warrants further study and evaluation but may be a potential option in cases where older adults with severe depressive symptoms cannot access ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Konstantinou, Gerasimos N.; Downar, Jonathan; Daskalakis, Zafiris J.; Blumberger, Daniel M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Gender and Fear of COVID-19 in a Cuban Population Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency that could potentially have a serious impact on public health. Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male. Our results corroborate international research that indicate a greater psychological vulnerability in women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result points to the need to design interventions that reduce the negative impact of the current outbreak on women’s mental health.","Broche-Pérez, Yunier; Fernández-Fleites, Zoylen; Jiménez-Puig, Elizabeth; Fernández-Castillo, Evelyn; Rodríguez-Martin, Boris C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00343-8","20200612",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Signal of Increased Opioid Overdose during COVID-19 from Emergency Medical Services Data","BACKGROUND: Individuals with opioid use disorder may be at heightened risk of opioid overdose during the COVID-19 period of social isolation, economic distress, and disrupted treatment services delivery. This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. METHODS: We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. RESULTS: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. CONCLUSIONS: This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.","Slavova, Svetla; Rock, Peter; Bush, Heather M.; Quesinberry, Dana; Walsh, Sharon L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A reformulated contextual model of psychotherapy for treating anxiety and depression","This paper describes a reformulated contextual model that uses cognitive theory (dual process theory), motivation theory (personality) and behavioral adaptation (self-correcting control systems) to show how anxiety and depression are caused, treated and prevented by an interaction between people and contexts. Depression and anxiety are the result of implicit beliefs (not cognitions) that all experience is unrewarding and threatening, these being components of the implicit belief that life is bad. Implicit beliefs are formed automatically from contextual cues and in healthy individuals are consistent with rational appraisal. They become more negative than reality through a process of adaptation when behaviors, directed by rational thinking, repeatedly create cues that signify lack of reward or threat. Such behaviors occur when social or other obligations lead people to choose behaviors that fail to satisfy their own unique goals in life and approach threatening situations, contrary to their automatic reactions. Therapeutic interventions and lifestyle change reverse these adaptive processes by positive experiences that create positive implicit beliefs, a change effected in different ways by contextual and specific mechanisms both of which correct the same fault of negative implicit beliefs. Effective therapeutic relationships and interventions are achieved by detecting and responding to a patient's unique needs and goals and their associated implicit beliefs. Mental health requires not only that people experience life as good as defined by their own goals and beliefs but also the avoidance of contexts where social and other pressures induce people to behave in ways inconsistent with their automatically generated feelings.","Hyland, Michael E.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101890","20200711",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups","OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early recovery stage across their ages in Shenzhen. METHOD: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Demographic variables, sociopsychological variables, medical history, and overall parameters of COVID-19 were collected by telephone interviews and by checking medical records. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS and SAS were 45.5±18.9, 47.3±13.1 and 43.2±10.2 respectively, meanwhile, 9(31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48(38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and post-infection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, which may improve after the quarantine or may persist and even deteriorate with time as reported in SARS survivors, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. The current study also contributes to geriatric psychiatry by indicating that the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Xin; Hu, Xiaopeng; Otte, Ekumi Ivo; Wang, Jianchun; An, Yawen; Li, Zhiwen; Yuan, Bo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff two months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China: A cross-sectional study","OBJECTIVE: Assessing the psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff exposed to COVID-19 in China. MEASURES: A cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires was conducted to evaluate frontline staff's psychological status and fatigue. Occurrence of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and The Fatigue Self-Assessment Scale (FSAS), respectively. RESULTS: The study included 2614 participants and found that anxiety (23.4%), depression (50.0%), and fatigue (73.7%) were common in frontline workers. Participants were divided into five groups (community workers, health care workers, volunteers, market administration, and others). Analysis showed that levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were much higher in community workers than others (P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression indicated that being a woman, young age, sleeping difficulty, having lower income or family support, and physical or mental diseases, were associated with bad mood and proneness to fatigue. Spearman analysis showed fatigue to be highly correlated with depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: In this study of frontline staff fighting COVID-19 in China, a high incidence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue was reported. Effective strategies need to be provided immediately to improve the mental health of staff in the COVID-19 frontline, with community workers, women, the young, and those with physical and mental diseases requiring particular attention.","Teng, Ziwei; Wei, Zirou; Qiu, Yan; Tan, Yuxi; Chen, Jindong; Tang, Hui; Wu, Haishan; Wu, Renrong; Huang, Jing","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.032","20200702",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

METHODS: During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.","Croll, Leah; Kurzweil, Arielle; Hasanaj, Lisena; Serrano, Liliana; Balcer, Laura J.; Galetta, Steven L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034","20200714",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Theoretical and applied study of the psychological and educational effects of lockdown in primary school students in Argentina","Abstract Emotions are complex states, which have a fundamental role for children’s mental health and learning. The proper self-regulation of emotions allows to tolerate frustrations, improves social skills and healthy bonds with peers and adults in the environment (Bisquerra, 2003, p. 12). The lack of regulation causes discomfort that leads to a decrease in academic performance (Graziano, Reavis, Keanes & Calkins, 2006) and particularly in reading comprehension, because this competence requires motivation and cognitive processes that will allow to process the linguistic code, interpret it and represent it symbolically (Alonso-Tapia, 2005, p. 64). In this work, we show the essential relationship between emotional regulation and reading comprehension in primary school students. After that, we study the effect of lockdown on these two processes. The aim is to have preliminary information about the challenges and effects of the current situation. To do this, a semi-structured survey has been conducted of parents and teachers in order to assess the psychological and educational effects of the current health situation. The results of 40 semi-structured telephone surveys are analyzed, 20 of parents of children with learning disorders and 20 of their classroom teachers in Traslasierra, Córdoba-Argentina. The results inform that the students and their parents have difficulties to regulate their emotions and this emotional struggle has a negative impact on comprehension of texts. The problems that previously presented in these two areas have increased due to the lack of adaptation of activities by teachers, the lack of knowledge of their parents to help them and the difficulty in accessing digital technologies. Both parents and teachers express that lockdown affects learning processes, although parents are also concerned about the effects on social life.","Sevilla Vallejo, Santiago; Ceballos Marón, Natalia Andrea","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100039","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological Intervention and COVID-19: What We Know So Far and What We Can Do","The coronavirus COVID-19 and the global pandemic has already had a substantial disruptive impact on society, posing major challenges to the provision of mental health services in a time of crisis, and carrying the spectre of an increased burden to mental health, both in terms of existing psychiatric disorder, and emerging psychological distress from the pandemic. In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities.

"COVID-19 prompts new executive orders from Minnesota governor","Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has signed Executive Orders 20-28 and 20-29, which will expand mental health counseling options for Minnesotans and streamline the process for Minnesotans applying for unemployment insurance, Minnesota Bring Me the News reported April 6. Executive Order 20-28 authorizes out-of-state mental health providers to treat Minnesota patients via telehealth services to “help ensure that the mental health needs of Minnesotans are met during the stress and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The order notes that many Minnesotans receive mental health care from providers in neighboring states, and this order will allow them to continue that care via virtual means. Gov. Walz has been trying to expand Minnesota's mental health care options during COVID-19, asking President Trump for a major disaster declaration so the state can be reimbursed for expanding community-based crisis counseling services. Executive Order 20-29 amends a previous order, EO 20-05, that was designed to help Minnesotans get unemployment insurance as quickly as possible rather than waiting the previous week following the loss of their jobs. Gov. Walz also announced $6.2 million in financial assistance grants that is earmarked for Minnesota veterans and their families who have been impacted by COVID-19 and will provide one-time payments of $1,000.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32320","20200410",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Psychometric Properties of a Spanish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in General Population of Lima, Peru","The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has increased the anxiety and fear experienced by many. The main objective of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Spanish-translated version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sample of population in Peru. This is a cross-sectional instrumental study. Data were collected by a convenience sampling method, resulting in a total of 832 participants, and the collection took place over 1 week, April 17–23, 2020. The original version of the FCV-19S was translated from English into Spanish. The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factors—one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of COVID-19 (CFI = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.075). Invariance between healthcare workers and age groups was reached (<U+0394>CFI < 0.01), but the invariance between men and women was not met (<U+0394>CFI = 0.02). Convergent validity was found with depressive, anxious, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The general factor of the fear of COVID-19 and two specific factors had an optimal level of internal consistency (<U+03C9> > 0.89 and a > 0.83). The study found the Spanish-translated version of the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties and presents evidence of validity and reliability.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). CONCLUSION: Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A.; Alrashed, Saleh A.; Alzunaydi, Ali A.; Almohimeed, Ahmed S.; Aljohani, Moath S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152192","20200712",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A contextual behavioral approach for responding to moral dilemmas in the age of COVID-19()()","Prior pandemics and current news stories suggest that a “second pandemic” of potentially devastating mental health consequences will follow the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the changing contextual demands associated with the pandemic for many people, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 are likely to include exposure to a range of moral dilemmas. Such dilemmas may set the stage for the development of moral distress and moral injury in a broad range of contexts from the ER to the grocery store. In the current paper we offer an approach to responding to moral dilemmas presented by COVID-19. We propose a contextual behavioral model of moral injury that is relevant to those experiencing moral pain associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this model, we offer two different approaches to intervening on COVID-19-related moral dilemmas. First, we propose the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Moral Injury (ACT-MI) among individuals suffering from moral injury. Second, to intervene on moral dilemmas at the level of the group, we propose the use of the Prosocial intervention. We offer case examples describing ACT-MI and Prosocial to highlight how these interventions might be applied to moral-dilemma-related concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss implications for future research.","Borges, Lauren M.; Barnes, Sean M.; Farnsworth, Jacob K.; Drescher, Kent D.; Walser, Robyn D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.06.006","20200704",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"A new SAIR model on complex networks for analysing the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","Nowadays, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading around the world and has attracted extremely wide public attention. From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on people’s livelihood, societies and economies.","Liu, Congying; Wu, Xiaoqun; Niu, Riuwu; Wu, Xiuqi; Fan, Ruguo","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-020-05704-5","20200615",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Evaluation of depression and anxiety levels and related factors among operating theatre workers during the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Abstract Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on healthcare workers due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of healthcare professionals working in operating theatres in various healthcare institutions in Turkey. Methods The data were collected online between 9 April 2020 and 12 April 2020 using a SurveyMonkey questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, California, United States) and healthcare workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings In total, 702 healthcare professionals working in operating theatres participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4±4.6 (min: 0–max: 21) and 10.0±4.5 (min: 0–max: 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (p<0.05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease and those whose workload increased (p<0.05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres. In order to reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of healthcare professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.","Koksal, Ersin; Dost, Burhan; Terzi, Özlem; Ustun, Yasemin Burcu; Özdin, Selçuk; Bilgin, Sezgin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017","20200619",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","Abstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients. Healthcare organizations need to provide professional therapeutic advice and psychosocial support for this population of patients during the pandemic.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Malobabic, Marina; Milosevic, Vuk; Stojanov, Jelena; Vojinovic, Slobodan; Stanojevic, Goran; Stevic, Milos","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102407","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","Nadkarni, Abhijit; Kapoor, Arjun; Pathare, Soumitra","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200520",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Do Quarantine Experiences and Attitudes Towards COVID-19 Affect the Distribution of Mental Health in China? A Quantile Regression Analysis","While quarantine has become a widely used control strategy during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), empirical research on whether and to what extent quarantine and attitudes towards COVID-19 affect mental health is scant. Using a cross-sectional online survey, this paper is the first from the Chinese outbreak to investigate how quarantine experiences and attitudes towards COVID-19 are related to mental health, and how these relationships change across the distribution of mental health scores. Using quantile regression analysis, we found that home self-quarantine is associated with a decrease in depression and an increase in happiness, while community-level quarantine is associated with decreased happiness, especially for those in the lower happiness quantile. We also found that favorable attitudes towards COVID-19 regarding the credibility of real-time updates and confidence in the epidemic control are associated with lower levels of depression and higher levels of happiness. These effects are stronger in the upper quantile of depression and the median quantile of happiness.","Lu, Haiyang; Nie, Peng; Qian, Long","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11482-020-09851-0","20200629",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

This case study examines an education and environment program which has adapted to the social distancing measures of COVID-19, resulting in an even more community-reliant and community-driven program than the program designers initially intended. The Eco Ambassador Program uses environmental activism within a space that supports mental health during COVID-19 social isolation. While community engagement and action have been elements of the program, the program has transformed to utilize new levels of social capital in the program’s network, to overcome the obstacles presented in regular programming. Many aspects of the critical pedagogy of space are utilized to conceptualize this educational program during the pandemic. The limitations of in-person interactions in defined learning spaces led to more technology-reliant programming, hence broadening the space of place-based learning, while enabling personal spaces and personal environments to become new learning spaces.","Iyengar, Radhika; Shin, Haein","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09467-0","20200529",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: a case-control study","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. METHODS: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. LIMITATIONS: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers.

"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of COVID-19: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the COVID-19. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs’ neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. METHODS: Literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950-2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. REVIEW: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible, and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of “psychosis following chloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications, however, overdose on these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for COVID-19 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for COVID-19, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Brandon S.; Rosenthal, Lisa J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022","20200708",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Massachusetts coalition launches campaign to preserve bed access","A coalition of registered nurses with the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA), along with patients, families, advocates and elected officials who have been fighting for the preservation of mental health beds across Western Massachusetts, has launched a new campaign, “Mental Health is Public Health,” to save essential inpatient psychiatric services, according to a March 16 news release. The effort comes as Trinity Health plans to close 74 pediatric and adult psychiatric beds at Providence Behavioral Health Hospital in Holyoke; Baystate Health seeks the closure of all its mental health beds in Greenfield, Palmer and Westfield; and COVID-19 places additional pressure on already-strained emergency departments and other hospital services throughout the region. “These proposed closures would devastate an already-strained mental health system,” said Cindy Chaplin, RN at Providence and co-chair of the MNA Bargaining Committee. “Right now, we need to maximize capacity in emergency departments and other hospital units, not decrease services. When everyone else in Massachusetts agrees we should be making it easier for patients to get high-quality mental healthcare, Trinity Health is going in the opposite direction.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32287","20200320",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Evaluation of botanical powders and extracts from Nigerian plants as protectants of maize grains against maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) [oleoptera: Curculionidae]","Toxicities of leaf powders and extracts of Acanthus montanus, Acanthospermum hispidum, Alchornea laxiflora and Argyreia nervosa against maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) were evaluated. Powders were tested at dose 3.0g/20g while extracts were tested at concentration 3%/20g of maize grains. Mortality, oviposition, and adult emergence rates as well as weight loss, seeds damage and weevil perforation index (WPI) were evaluated. Phytochemical constituents of the experimental plants were also carried out. The results showed that Acanthus montanus powder was the most potent with 65% adult mortality after 24 h of treatment. This is followed by Argyreia nervosa powder that evoked 52.5% weevil mortality. The least toxic to S. zeamais was Acanthospermum hispidum powder with 32.5% adult mortality. Extracts were more toxic than the powders of the tested plants. Acanthus montanus extract was the most toxic since it promoted 80% adult mortality after 24 h of treatment. Acanthus montanus, Alchornea laxiflora and Argyreia nervosa leaf powders and extracts completely prevented oviposition by adult insect, adult emergence, weight loss and seeds damaged. The phytochemicals present in Acanthus montanus were alkaloids (3.67 mg/g), saponin (3.33 mg/g), tannin (3.00 mg/g) and flavonoid (2.67 mg/g) contents.

"Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of the COVID-19 is a severe global crisis and resulted in public health problems in many aspects. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged =17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5(th) to 14(th) March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Totally, near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years old, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study can be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during such public health emergency.","Yang, Yu; Zhu, Jian-fu; Yang, Shu-yue; Lin, Hai-jiang; Chen, Yue; Zhao, Qi; Fu, Chao-wei","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034","20200714",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Minimizing the aerosol-generating procedures in orthodontics in the era of a pandemic: Current evidence on the reduction of hazardous effects for the treatment team and patients","The purpose of this critical review is to list the sources of aerosol production during orthodontic standard procedure, analyze the constituent components of aerosol and their dependency on modes of grinding, the presence of water and type of bur, and suggest a method to minimize the quantity and detrimental characteristics of the particles comprising the solid matter of aerosol. Minimization of water-spray syringe utilization for rinsing is suggested on bonding related procedures, while temporal conditions as represented by seasonal epidemics should be considered for the decision of intervention scheme provided as a preprocedural mouth rinse, in an attempt to reduce the load of aerosolized pathogens. In normal conditions, chlorhexidine 0.2%, preferably under elevated temperature state should be prioritized for reducing bacterial counts. In the presence of oxidation vulnerable viruses within the community, substitute strategies might be represented by the use of povidone iodine 0.2%-1%, or hydrogen peroxide 1%. After debonding, extensive material grinding, as well as aligner related attachment clean-up, should involve the use of carbide tungsten burs under water cooling conditions for cutting efficiency enhancement, duration restriction of the procedure, as well as reduction of aerosolized nanoparticles. In this respect, selection strategies of malocclusions eligible for aligner treatment should be reconsidered and future perspectives may entail careful and more restricted utilization of attachment grips. For more limited clean-up procedures, such as grinding of minimal amounts of adhesive remnants, or individualized bracket debonding in the course of treatment, hand-instruments for remnant removal might well represent an effective strategy. Efforts to minimize the use of rotary instrumentation in orthodontic settings might also lead the way for future solutions. Measures of self-protection for the treatment team should never be neglected. Dressing gowns and facemasks with filter protection layers, appropriate ventilation and fresh air flow within the operating room comprise significant links to the overall picture of practice management. Risk management considerations should be constant, but also updated as new material applications come into play, while being grounded on the best available evidence.","Eliades, Theodore; Koletsi, Despina","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.06.002","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"How mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The unpredictability and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic; the associated lockdowns, physical distancing, and other containment strategies; and the resulting economic breakdown could increase the risk of mental health problems and exacerbate health inequalities. Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services.","Moreno, Carmen; Wykes, Til; Galderisi, Silvana; Nordentoft, Merete; Crossley, Nicolas; Jones, Nev; Cannon, Mary; Correll, Christoph U; Byrne, Louise; Carr, Sarah; Chen, Eric Y H; Gorwood, Philip; Johnson, Sonia; Kärkkäinen, Hilkka; Krystal, John H; Lee, Jimmy; Lieberman, Jeffrey; López-Jaramillo, Carlos; Männikkö, Miia; Phillips, Michael R; Uchida, Hiroyuki; Vieta, Eduard; Vita, Antonio; Arango, Celso","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(20)30307-2","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Deliberate release: Plague – A review","Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered one of the most likely pathogens to be used as a bioweapon. In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001","20200330",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan","Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Results: Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90s (ß = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (ß = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (ß = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest the targeted psychological intervention measures should be developed to improve the mental health of non-medical workers on the front-line of COVID-19 epidemic, especially the females and younger individuals.","Fang, Xinyu; Zhang, Jiaying; Teng, Chao; Zhao, Ke; Su, Kuan-Pin; Wang, Zhen; Tang, Wei; Zhang, Chen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.078","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Evidence map on the contributions of traditional, complementary and integrative medicines for health care in times of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Due to the pandemic, there is a significant interest in the therapeutic resources linked to TCIM to support potentially therapeutic research and intervention in the management of COVID-19. At the date of this evidence map´s publication, there is no evidence of specific treatments for Coronavirus - 19 (COVID-19). This map organizes information about symptoms management (especially on dimensions related to mental health and mild viral respiratory infections, as well as immune system strengthening and antiviral activity). METHOD: This evidence map applies methodology developed by Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information based on the 3iE evidence gap map. A search was performed in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine Virtual Health Library and PubMed, using the MeSH and DeCS terms for respiratory viral diseases associated with epidemics, COVID-19 symptoms, relevant mental health topics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions related to TCIM. RESULTS: For the map, 126 systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies were characterized, distributed in a matrix with 57 interventions (18 phytotherapy, 9 mind-body therapies, 10 traditional chinese medicine, 3 homeopathic and anthroposophic dynamized medicines and 17 supplements), and 67 outcomes (14 immunological response, 23 mental health, 25 complementary clinical management of the infection and 5 other). DISCUSSION: The map presents an overview of possible TCIM contributions to various dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the field of mental health, and it is directed to researchers and health professionals specialized in TCIM. Most of the antiviral activity outcomes described in this map refers to respiratory viruses in general, and not specifically to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2). This information may be useful to guide new research, but not necessarily to support a therapeutic recommendation. Finally, any suspicion of COVID-19 infection should follow the protocols recommended by the health authorities of each country/region.","Portella, Caio Fabio Schlechta; Ghelman, Ricardo; Abdala, Carmen Verônica Mendes; Schveitzer, Mariana Cabral","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.imr.2020.100473","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"“It's about how much we can do, and not how little we can get away with”: Coronavirus-related legislative changes for social care in the United Kingdom","The coronavirus pandemic, referred to here as Covid-19, has brought into sharp focus the increasing divergence of devolved legislation and its implementation in the United Kingdom. One such instance is the emergency health and social care legislation and guidance introduced by the United Kingdom Central Government and the devolved Governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in response to this pandemic. We provide a summary, comparison and discussion of these proposed and actual changes with a particular focus on the impact on adult social care and safeguarding of the rights of citizens. To begin, a summary and comparison of the relevant changes, or potential changes, to mental health, mental capacity and adult social care law across the four jurisdictions is provided. Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Sarah; Stone, Kevin; McCusker, Pearse; Davidson, Gavin; Spencer-Lane, Tim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101601","20200622",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"

"Exploring COVID-19 stress and its factors in Bangladesh: A perception-based study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has aggregated mental health sufferings throughout the entire world. Suicide completions are the extreme consequences of COVID-19 related psychological burdens, which was reported in many countries including Bangladesh. However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its’ associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. METHODS: An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). RESULTS: About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country.

"International tracking of the COVID-19 invasion: an amazing example of a globalized scientific coordination effort","It is extraordinary to witness the spread of COVID-19 almost in real-time. This tight monitoring of the invasion of a new virus is a situation that most other invasion scientists could only dream of. Especially spatiotemporal spread data of the early phases of an invasion would be extremely useful in order to understand and predict the human-mediated spread of species around the globe. So far, invasive species that directly affect human health, such as the Sars-Cov-2 virus causing COVID-19, have been treated differently from invasive species affecting environmental health. Despite progresses in constructing large checklists of invasive species, these records often enter the databases only decades after the establishment of the organism in a country. This is inadequate to understand ongoing spread dynamics and estimate current invasion risks. Yet, national services often possess extremely useful information about early detections and interceptions of species at air and maritime ports, which could greatly improve predictions and help set management priorities. Considering the massive impacts of invasive species, it is time to move on to such a collaborative way of handling invasion data. Invasive insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and other species are the result of globalization and call for a globalized response, exactly like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertelsmeier, Cleo; Ollier, Sébastien","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02287-5","20200519",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-09-04"
"Stress and burnout in health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic: validation of a questionnaire","AIM: To validate a questionnaire to assess stress and burnout in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study, content validity, Cronbach’s alpha, and test–retest reliability method were utilized among 60 HCWs to evaluate the validity, internal consistency, and reliability of the questionnaire respectively. The final questionnaire was composed of four parts asking for the background information, questions about the stress caused by the COVID-19, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), and six questions from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). RESULTS: The CVR of 46 questions was equal to 1, making them acceptably valid (CVR > 0.78), so that the items could be arranged into a final questionnaire. Moreover, all items could successfully attain CVI values above 0.79, confirming the content validity of the questionnaire. The Cronbach’s alpha was between 0.80–0.95 for different sections of questionaire, confirming the stable reliability and high repeatability of the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the DASS-21 offers adequate levels of validity and reliability for assessing the stress, anxiety, and depression among the HCWs engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Current and Future Challenges in the Delivery of Mental Healthcare during COVID-19","The USA is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric symptoms in healthcare workers, those with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population. We highlight the challenges ahead and discuss the increased relevance of telepsychiatry. We analyzed all available literature available as of March 25, 2020, on PubMed, Ovid Medline, and PsychInfo. We utilized the MeSH term “covid AND (psychiatry OR mental health)” and included all articles. Duplicates were removed resulting in 32 articles, of which 19 are cited. Four additional references are included to examine suicide data. During the review process, an additional 7 articles were identified which are also included. Frontline healthcare workers are currently experiencing increased psychiatric symptoms and this is more severe in females and nurses. Non-frontline healthcare workers, as well as the general population, are experiencing vicarious traumatization. People with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population, face increased psychiatric symptom burden. Migrant workers, the elderly, children, and the homeless may be disproportionately impacted. Suicide rates may be impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe disruption to the delivery of mental healthcare. Psychiatric facilities are facing unprecedented disruptions in care provision as they struggle to manage an infected population with comorbid psychiatric symptoms.

Therefore, the present study validated three instruments assessing fear, beliefs, and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19 among individuals with mental illness. Moreover, relationships between the three constructs were examined. Individuals with mental illness (N = 400; 178 females; mean age = 46.91 years) completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Believing COVID-19 Information Scale (BCIS), Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale (PCIBS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The FCV-19S, BCIS, and PCIBS demonstrated a single-factor structure with satisfactory fit indices. Moreover, believing COVID-19 information positively and significantly associated with fear of COVID-19, and fear of COVID-19 negatively and significantly associated with preventive behaviors and positively and significantly associated with psychological distress.

The purpose of the present study is to examine the mediating role of optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility in the relationship of coronavirus stress with psychological problems among Turkish adults. The sample of the study included 451 adults (55% women). Participants mainly consisted of young adults with a mean age of 23.30 years, ranging from 18 to 65 years (SD = 6.97). A mediation model indicated that coronavirus stress had a significant predictive effect on optimism-pessimism, psychological inflexibility, and psychological problems. Further, optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility mediated the effect of coronavirus stress on psychological problems in adults. Lastly, optimism-pessimism predicted the psychological problems of adults through psychological inflexibility. These results elucidate our understanding of the role of mediators in coronavirus stress and psychological health problems. The findings are useful in terms of providing evidence for tailoring interventions and implementing preventative approaches to mitigate the psychopathological consequences of COVID-19.
