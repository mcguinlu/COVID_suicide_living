"Depression, Anxiety and Depression-anxiety comorbidity amid COVID-19 Pandemic: An online survey conducted during lockdown in Nepal","Background: Little is known about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health status during the lock-down period. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess prevalence of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety comorbidity, and associated factors during the COVID-19 lock-down in Nepal. Methods A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Nepal. Data was collected from April 9 to April 16, 2020 using an e-questionnaire which was shared through different popular social media. A total of 349 participants were included. Self-reported depression and anxiety were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety tools respectively. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors associated with depression, anxiety and depression and anxiety co-morbidity. Results The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity were found to be 34.0%, 31.0% and 23.2% respectively. The multi-variate analysis showed that females, those living alone, health professionals and those who spent more time in accessing information about COVID-19 were significantly more likely to have depression, anxiety and depression-anxiety co-morbidity. Conclusions High rates of depression and anxiety and co-morbidity were found to be prevailing among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic lock-down in Nepal. The results suggest that only the scientific, but contextually appropriate messages about the disease should be disseminated to reduce unnecessary fears and anxiety. Awareness interventions to promote mental well-being need to be integrated into the response interventions. Community mental health care should be made accessible to at-risk groups.","Sigdel, A.; Bista, A.; Bhattarai, N.; Poon, B.

"Three CoViD-19 Mortality Indicators for Temporal and International Comparisons","In response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) pandemic, national and local institutions have issued public-health orders to slow the spread of the disease. Comparing CoViD-19 trends over time and place may thus provide important public health insights about the impact of different strategies. To aid these comparisons, we illustrate the properties of three comparative indicators of CoViD-19 mortality using estimates and projections for the world most affected areas. We first demonstrate how a Crude CoViD-19 Death Rate (CCDR) incorporates the temporal dimension of CoViD-19 mortality. We also show how the advantage of the indirectly age-standardized Comparative CoViD-19 Mortality Ratio (CCMR). Finally, we calculate declines in life expectancy at birth that translate CoViD-19 mortality projections into an easily interpretable metric. Projections used to illustrate this yields a .3 of a year decline in life expectancy at birth for the U.S.A., for instance, which would be comparable to the decline in life expectancy at birth between 1992 and 1993 (AIDS mortality) and between 2014 and 2017 (opioid-overdose mortality). Data about the pandemic are changing too rapidly to draw any conclusion from the current values of the indicators, however, and there are multiple reasons to expect upward revisions of these projections.","Heuveline, P.; Tzen, M.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.29.20085506v1?rss=1""","20200505",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental Health Status of the General Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional National Survey in Japan","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may have detrimental mental health consequences. However, as yet, there is limited understanding of its impact on the mental health of the general population. The aim of this study is to examine the mental health of the Japanese general population by conducting the first systematic survey during the pandemic (N=1,000), with a particular focus on identifying the most vulnerable groups. Results from logistic regression analyses showed that the mental health of young and middle-aged individuals was significantly worse than that of older individuals during the pandemic. There was also some indication that individuals who were not currently working were significantly more likely to report a high level of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Part-time and temporary contract-based workers were also more likely to suffer from anxiety disorder. Our results highlight that monitoring the mental health of younger and economically vulnerable individuals may be especially important. In addition, they also indicate that population mental health might not only be affected by the direct health consequences of COVID-19, but also by the economic ramifications of the pandemic.","Ueda, M.; Stickley, A.; Sueki, H.; Matsubayashi, T.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082453v1?rss=1""","20200503",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Simulating a community mental health service during the COVID-19 pandemic: effects of clinician-clinician encounters, clinician-patient-family encounters, symptom-triggered protective behaviour, and household clustering","Background. Face-to-face healthcare, including psychiatric provision, must continue despite reduced interpersonal contact during the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) pandemic. Community-based services might use domiciliary visits, consultations in healthcare settings, or remote consultations. Services might also alter direct contact between clinicians. Aims. We examined the effects of appointment types and clinician-clinician encounters upon infection rates. Methods. We modelled a COVID-19-like disease in a hypothetical community healthcare team, their patients, and patients' household contacts (family). In one condition, clinicians met patients and briefly met family (e.g. home visit or collateral history). In another, patients attended alone (e.g. clinic visit), segregated from each other. In another, face-to-face contact was eliminated (e.g. videoconferencing). We also varied clinician-clinician contact; baseline and ongoing ""external"" infection rates; whether overt symptoms reduced transmission risk behaviourally (e.g. via personal protective equipment, PPE); and household clustering. Results. Service organization had minimal effects on whole-population infection under our assumptions but materially affected clinician infection. Appointment type and inter-clinician contact had greater effects at low external infection rates and without a behavioural symptom response. Clustering magnified the effect of appointment type. We discuss infection control and other factors affecting appointment choice and team organization. Conclusions. Distancing between clinicians can have significant effects on team infection. Loss of clinicians to infection likely has an adverse impact on care, not modelled here. Appointments must account for clinical necessity as well as infection control. Interventions to reduce transmission risk can synergize, arguing for maximal distancing and behavioural measures (e.g. PPE) consistent with safe care.","Cardinal, R. N.; Meiser-Stedman, C.

"Psychological Stress and Gender Differences during COVID-19 Pandemic in Chinese Population","Background The COVID-19 disease has been spreading for more than four months in China and been pronounced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). As an urgent public health crisis, it has severe physical and psychological impacts on human. The related experience and mental health on individuals and society during the pandemic can be devastating and has lasting impact. Objective To investigate the psychological stress and gender difference responding to the threat of COVID-19 and relevant factors. Methods A cross-sectional population-based study using online questionnaires via a social media software, WeChat, from 20th to 27th Feb, 2020. Psychological stress was measured by visual analogue scale (VAS). The relevant factors included demographics, the epidemic and living status characteristics related to COVID-19, psychological status, the needs of psychological support services, and psychological resilience. Psychological responses to depression, anxiety were also measured. Results Total 3088 questionnaires from 32 provinces in China were collected online. The average score of psychological stress was 3.4. The risk factors related to psychological stress included: female, [&le;]45 years old, higher education, farmer/worker/clerical and business/service, unemployed, more diseases, uncertainty local epidemic status, close contact or completed a medical observation, higher desire for knowledge about the COVID-19, the diseases, psychological, economic difficulties during the epidemic. The protect factors included: frequently contacting with colleagues, calm mood, and high psychological resilience. There were gender differences on stress, the adaption to current living/working status, the coping strategy for heating, and the psychological support service needs. Conclusion The stress, anxiety and depression were mainly related to gender, age, education, and occupation during the epidemic of COVID-19. It suggested that we should make appropriate control measures and provide different psychological supports according to different population characteristics.","Song, K.; Li, T.; Luo, D.; Hou, F.; Bi, F.; Stratton, T.

"When the storm is the strongest: The health conditions and job satisfaction of Healthcare staff and their associated predictors during the epidemic peak of COVID-19","This study reports the physical health, mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, and job satisfaction of healthcare staff in Iran when the country faced its highest number of total active COVID-19 cases. In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China. This study helps to identify the healthcare staff in need to enable more targeted help as healthcare staff in many countries are facing peaks in their COVID-19 cases.","Zhang, S.

"Mental Health of Clinical Staff Working in High-Risk Epidemic and Pandemic Health Emergencies: A Rapid Review of the Evidence and Meta-Analysis","The global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 has raised concerns about the potential mental health impact on frontline clinical staff. However, given that poor mental health is common in staff working in acute medicine, we aimed to estimate the additional burden of working directly with infected patients during epidemic and pandemic health emergencies. We completed a rapid review of the evidence and identified 74 relevant studies from outbreaks of COVID-19, Ebola, H1N1 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Due to varying caseness criteria, a meta-analysis of prevalence was not possible. However, it was clear that levels of self-reported depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related symptoms were high, and somewhat higher in clinical staff working in high exposure roles. To assess the impact of high- versus low-exposure healthcare work more formally, we estimated the standardised mean difference (SMD) of scale means using a random effects meta-analysis. High exposure work was associated with only a small additional burden of acute mental health problems compared to low exposure work (anxiety: SMD=0.22, 95% CI 0.06 - 0.38; PTSD symptoms: SMD=0.21, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.4; depression: SMD=0.20, -0.07 - 0.47). This effect was potentially inflated by publication bias and there was a moderate risk of bias in the studies in the meta-analysis. A narrative review of candidate risk factors identified being a nurse, seeing colleagues infected, experiencing quarantine, non-voluntary role assignment, and experiencing stigma, as associated with particularly poor mental health outcomes. Protective factors included team and institutional support, use and faith in infection prevention measures, and a sense of professional duty and altruistic acceptance of risk. Notably, formal psychological support services were valued by frontline staff, although those with the highest burden of mental health difficulties were the least likely to request or receive support.","Bell, V.; Wade, D.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.28.20082669v1?rss=1""","20200502",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Geographical identification of the vulnerable groups during COVID-19 crisis: the typhoon eye effect and its boundary conditions","Although some studies suggest the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with negative consequences on physical health, our knowledge about the detrimental effects of COVID-19 on individual mental health is still nascent. This study uses typhoon eye theory to offer insights in helping clinical psychiatrists to screen people with well-being issues during COVID-19 outbreak. We collected survey data from working adults across different geographical areas in China on 20 and 21 February 2020 during the outbreak of COVID-19. The sample contains 308 working adults, who were in various parts of China, with varying distance to the epicenter of Wuhan. The distance of individual adults to the epicenter was negatively associated with life satisfaction ({beta} = -0.235, 95% CI -0.450 to -0.020, p = 0.032). This association between distance and life satisfaction was significant only for adults who were young or had smaller family sizes. For example, the negative relationship was strongest when the individuals were in the age bracket of 20 years old (15.7%; {beta} = -0.703, 95% CI -1.098 to -0.307; p = 0.001) and single (32.3%; {beta} = -0.767, 95% CI -1.125 to -0.408; p < 0.001). Our results that well-being deteriorates by the distance from the epicenter for specific groups of people help guide mental healthcare providers towards the regions that are further away from the epicenter in the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, our results indicate the practitioners should be cautious of using typhoon eye effect for individuals who were older or had a larger family size.","Tang, P. M.; Zhang, S. X.; Li, C.

"Coronavirus Infection and PARP Expression Dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: A Potentially Actionable Component of Innate Immunity","SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV) and cause of COVID-19, which is much more lethal in older people and those with comorbid conditions for unknown reasons. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.

Impact statementSpecific disturbances in the NAD gene set, NAD metabolome and PARP activity were discovered as a defining feature of coronavirus infection that may lead to methods to boost innate immunity.","Heer, C.

"Filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators","The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in different countries around the world  Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed  Given the situation, the U S  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e g , bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort ” Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail  Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available  In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials  The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances  The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials  The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance  Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators","Hao, Weixing; Parasch, Andrew; Williams, Stephen; Li, Jiayu; Ma, Hongyan; Burken, Joel; Wang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health;229:113582-113582, 2020.; Publication details: International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health;229:113582-113582, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Retraction and republication: cardiac toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (The Lancet, (S0140673620311740), (101016/S0140-6736(20)31174-0))","A recent Lancet Article by Mandeep Mehra and colleagues, which reported adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine treatment in patients with COVID-19, has been retracted by three of the authors,1 along with our linked Comment that provided a commentary on the Article and its findings,2 because the veracity of the data underlying this observational study could not be assured by the study authors  Subsequently, an article that used data from the same Surgisphere database, and which was authored by some of the same individuals, was retracted from the New England Journal of Medicine  Nevertheless, the debate about hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 continues  Here, we provide a discussion of what is currently known about its proven and potential harms  Hydroxychloroquine is a 4-aminoquinoline that prolongs ventricular repolarisation, as evidenced by prolongation of the QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) on the electrocardiogram 3 QTc prolongation can be associated with a specific ventricular arrhythmia called torsade de pointes, which, although often self-terminating, can degenerate into ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation, leading to death  Torsade de pointes is a rare event, with an estimated annual crude rate of 3·2 per million population;the incidence is almost doubled in women compared with men and increases with age 4 Drug-induced torsade de pointes mostly occurs by blockade of the cardiac rapid delayed rectifier channels in the presence of several risk factors, including high drug concentration, simultaneous exposure to multiple QTc-prolonging drugs, coronary heart disease, heart failure, hypokalaemia, bradycardia, or congenital long-QT syndrome, among others 5 Severe proarrhythmic events with hydroxychloroquine were first reported in 1992 in the WHO pharmacovigilance database, VigiBase  Although under-reporting is expected in pharmacovigilance databases, the incidence of cardiac adverse events remained very low during decades of prescription, and previous reports were mainly concerned with overdose situations  We recently analysed cases of prolonged QT interval, cardiac conduction disorders, and torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia associated with hydroxychloroquine in VigiBase before the COVID-19 pandemic 6 Using disproportionality analysis, we found a significant association between hydroxychloroquine and the reporting of prolonged QT interval or torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia versus the same adverse events with all other drugs in the database  However, the number of cases was small: 85 for prolonged QT interval and 83 for torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia  Seven (8%) of the 83 cases of torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia were fatal  The risks of cardiac adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic might increase for several reasons  Patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection have multiple risk factors for drug-induced proarrhythmia: hypokalaemia, in the 3·0-3·4 mmol/L range, is common;fever amplifies drug-induced blockade of cardiac rapid delayed rectifier channels;and an increase in interleukin-6 concentrations, as seen in SARS-CoV-2 infection, has been suggested as a mechanism of the QT prolongation associated with inflammation 7 Also, high doses of hydroxychloroquine are often administered in COVID-19, many patients receive co-prescriptions with QT-prolonging drugs, including azithromycin,7,8 and about 30% of patients with COVID-19 have myocardial injury 9 These are risk factors for torsade de pointes or ventricular tachycardia 5 QTc prolongation associated with hydroxychloroquine is amplified in patients with COVID-19 compared with non-COVID-19 patients, with 10–20% of patients with COVID-19 having QTc values of more than 500 ms 10 However, QTc prolongation is not the only mechanism that might be associated with an increased incidence of cardiac adverse events with hydroxychloroquine  QRS interval duration, a sodium-channel-dependent ventricul r conduction parameter, is increased in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine 10 Sodium-channel blockade is amplified in depolarised cardiomyocytes, as is seen in myocardial ischaemia, and by rapid heart rates, two conditions that are associated with hypoxia and COVID-19 9,11 This mechanism is known to be associated with re-entrant ventricular tachycardia, heart failure, and mortality 5 Recent randomised clinical trials have confirmed that hydroxychloroquine does not reduce mortality of hospitalised patients with COVID-19 12 The hydroxychloroquine arm of the RECOVERY trial, which used high doses of hydroxychloroquine, was stopped with preliminary results showing possible excess mortality with hydroxychloroquine (25·7% with hydroxychloroquine vs 23·5% with usual care;hazard ratio 1·11 [95% CI 0·98–1·26];p=0·10) 13 The same trend was found in an observational study in which the adjusted odds ratio of cardiac arrest with hydroxychloroquine alone compared with no hydroxychloroquine was 1·91 (95% CI 0·96–3·81)and was significantly increased if hydroxychloroquine was combined with azithromycin (2·13 [1·12–4·05]);8 however, mortality was not increased  Several arguments support the hypothesis that hydroxychloroquine, in addition to having no beneficial effect in hospitalised patients with COVID-19, might have potentially fatal cardiac effects  We declare no competing interests","Funck-Brentano, C.; Nguyen, L.

"Reckoning With the Relation Between Stressors and Suicide Attempts in a Time of Covid-19","The Covid-19 pandemic presents a unique set of risk exposures to populations, which may lead to an increase in suicide  While large-scale traumatic events are known to increase psychological disorders, thus far the science has not shown a clear link between these events and suicide  In their paper in this issue, Elbogen and colleagues (Am J Epidemiol  2020;(XX):XXXX-XXXX) use representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to show that four dimensions of financial strain-financial debt/crisis, unemployment, past homelessness, lower income-are associated with subsequent suicide attempts  There are three main learnings we may take from Elbogen et al: first, with populations facing record-breaking unemployment, economic recession, and reduced wages, we can anticipate an increase in suicide in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic  Second, these data show the centrality of financial stressors, marking the current moment as distinct from other disasters or large-scale trauma  Third, the data teach us that financial stressors are linked, and cumulative  In this way, the paper is a sobering harbinger of the potential effects on suicide of the collective stressors borne by the Covid-19 pandemic and other mass traumatic events that are accompanied by substantial financial stressors","Ettman, C.

"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Tisler, Anna","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Med Hypotheses;143: 110069, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: Med Hypotheses;143: 110069, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","OBJECTIVE: To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). STUDY DESIGN: Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. RESULTS: Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction. All patients were discharged home with median duration of pediatric intensive care unit stay of 4.7 days (IQR, 4-8 days) and a hospital stay of 7.8 days (IQR, 6.0-10.1 days). One patient (3%) died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Megan E; Brown, Patrick J; Karp, Jordan F; Lenard, Emily; Cameron, Flor; Dawdani, Alicia; Lavretsky, Helen; Miller, J Philip; Mulsant, Benoit H; Pham, Vy T; Reynolds, Charles F; Roose, Steven P; Lenze, Eric J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Geriatr Psychiatry;2020 Jun 20.; Publication details: Am J Geriatr Psychiatry;2020 Jun 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental Health and Cancer: Why It Is Time to Innovate and Integrate-A Call to Action","Surgical, radio-oncological, and medical anti-cancer therapies have developed at pace and scale in recent years, yet there remains a huge unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Recent experience in the COVID-19 pandemic has added to recognition of this unmet need. There needs to be more effective clinical integration of relevant services, which must be informed by patient choice and clinical need, and accessible throughout the patient's whole cancer journey. This needs to be accompanied by training and research integration as well as more effective and creative use of technology such as virtual reality and simulation, quality assuring apps, and mobile technologies. Finally, as a clinical community we need to drive a shift in culture towards measurement of patient quality of life as a marker of treatment effectiveness. We also need to support our own clinical workforce with their own mental health needs so that we prevent the alarming rates of burnout prevalent among clinicians treating cancer. The call to action for innovation and staff support has been amplified by experience in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: This report highlights the unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Patients need effective access to psychological support and mental health services throughout their cancer journey, including better use of technology. There is also a need to support the psychological wellbeing of cancer clinicians.","Fernando, Asanga","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.06.025",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Urol Focus;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Eur Urol Focus;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.","Cohen, Megan A; Powell, Anna M; Coleman, Jenell S; Keller, Jean M; Livingston, Alison; Anderson, Jean R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 Jun 06.; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 Jun 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei","BACKGROUND: In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to clarify the epidemiology, laboratory examinations, imaging findings, and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei province, China. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the demographic, laboratory and imaging, and treatment data of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in 13 designated hospitals in Hebei were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 319 severe COVID-19 patients were treated at the 13 designated hospitals between 22 January, 2020 and 25 March, 2020. Eventually, 51 critically ill (31 severe cases and 20 critically severe cases) patients were included in the analysis. The patients had an average age of 58.9±13.7 years, and 27 (52.9%) were men. Twenty-one (41.2%) were familial cluster, and 33 (64.7%) had chronic illnesses. The patients in critically severe group had longer duration from symptom to confirmation, more severe infections, more severe lung injury, and a lower percentage of lymphocytes. All 51 patients received antiviral drugs, 47 (92.2%) received antibacterial agents, 49 (96.1%) received traditional Chinese drugs, and 46 (90.2%) received methylprednisolone. The critically severe patients received more fluid and more diuretic treatment; 14 (70.0%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 13 (65.0%) developed extrapulmonary complications. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients who had underlying diseases and longer confirmation times were more likely to progress to critically severe COVID-19. These patients also presented with a higher risk of respiratory depression, circulatory collapse, extrapulmonary complications, and infection.","Chen, Yuhong; Zhang, Kun; Zhu, Guijun; Liu, Lixia; Yan, Xixin; Cai, Zhigang; Zhang, Zhongheng; Zhi, Haijun; Hu, Zhenjie","https://dx.doi.org/10.21037/apm-20-1273",NA,"Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ann Palliat Med;2020 Jul 20.; Publication details: Ann Palliat Med;2020 Jul 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Bereavement in the Time of Coronavirus: Unprecedented Challenges Demand Novel Interventions","COVID-19 fatalities exemplify ""bad deaths"" and are distinguished by physical discomfort, difficulty breathing, social isolation, psychological distress, and care that may be discordant with the patient's preferences. Each of these death attributes is a well-documented correlate of bereaved survivors' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger. Yet the grief experienced by survivors of COVID-related deaths is compounded by the erosion of coping resources like social support, contemporaneous stressors including social isolation, financial precarity, uncertainty about the future, lack of routine, and the loss of face-to-face mourning rituals that provide a sense of community and uplift. National efforts to enhance advance care planning may help dying patients to receive care that is concordant with the preferences of them and their families. Virtual funeral services, pairing bereaved elders with a telephone companion, remote counseling, and encouraging ""continuing bonds"" may help older adults adapt to loss in the time of pandemic.","Carr, Deborah; Boerner, Kathrin; Moorman, Sara","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08959420.2020.1764320",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Aging Soc Policy;32(4-5): 425-431, 2020.; Publication details: J Aging Soc Policy;32(4-5): 425-431, 2020.; Bereavement; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Ceremonial Behavior; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Social Support; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Burnout and its influencing factors between frontline nurses and nurses from other wards during the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease -COVID-19- in Iran","Objective. To assess burnout level during an outbreak of COVID-19 and to identify influencing factors between frontline nurses and nurses from other wards. Methods. This cross-sectional study makes comparison between two groups of nurses including frontline (exposure group) and other nurses working in usual wards (non-exposure group) in Torbat Heydariyeh city, Iran. Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OLBI), Job stress questionnaire (JSQ), and questionnaires of hospital resources, family support, and measuring the fear of COVID-19 were used as research instruments. Results. The scores of job stress and burnout in the exposure group with COVID-19 infection were significantly higher than in the non-exposure group (p=0.006 and p=0.002, respectively). Although, in univariate linear regression, employment status (p=0.047), experience in taking care of patient confirmed or suspected with COVID-19 infection (p=0.006), hospital resources (p=0.047), and job stress (p<0.001) were considered as significant risk factors for COVID-19-related burnout. In multivariate regression analysis, job stress (p=0.031, ß=0.308) was considered as an only factor that has a significant relationship with COVID-19-related burnout. Conclusion. The burnout level in frontline nurses was higher than other nurses, the most important influencing factor was the job stress. Regarding to negative effects of burnout on both physical and mental health nurses, it is suggested that a strong strategy be considered to reduce nurses' burnout to be able to control ongoing and future outbreaks successfully.; Objetivo.

"Techniques, Methods, and Dissemination of Community-Based Psychological Support Strategies in Times of the COVID-19 Pandemic","In times of the coronavirus pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 psychological support needs to meet certain requirements. Due to the lockdown in many countries of the world, the every-day activities of millions of people are reduced to a minimum. This may cause increased psychosomatic symptoms in persons with pre-existing mental illnesses, and additionally raises new challenges for the general population. As a result of the current contact restrictions, access to psychotherapy is further complicated.

"Research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A call to action for psychological science","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents the greatest international biopsychosocial emergency the world has faced for a century, and psychological science has an integral role to offer in helping societies recover. The aim of this paper is to set out the shorter- and longer-term priorities for research in psychological science that will (a) frame the breadth and scope of potential contributions from across the discipline; (b) enable researchers to focus their resources on gaps in knowledge; and (c) help funders and policymakers make informed decisions about future research priorities in order to best meet the needs of societies as they emerge from the acute phase of the pandemic. The research priorities were informed by an expert panel convened by the British Psychological Society that reflects the breadth of the discipline; a wider advisory panel with international input; and a survey of 539 psychological scientists conducted early in May 2020. The most pressing need is to research the negative biopsychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate immediate and longer-term recovery, not only in relation to mental health, but also in relation to behaviour change and adherence, work, education, children and families, physical health and the brain, and social cohesion and connectedness. We call on psychological scientists to work collaboratively with other scientists and stakeholders, establish consortia, and develop innovative research methods while maintaining high-quality, open, and rigorous research standards.","O'Connor, Daryl B; Aggleton, John P; Chakrabarti, Bhismadev; Cooper, Cary L; Creswell, Cathy; Dunsmuir, Sandra; Fiske, Susan T; Gathercole, Susan; Gough, Brendan; Ireland, Jane L; Jones, Marc V; Jowett, Adam; Kagan, Carolyn; Karanika-Murray, Maria; Kaye, Linda K; Kumari, Veena; Lewandowsky, Stephan; Lightman, Stafford; Malpass, Debra; Meins, Elizabeth; Morgan, B Paul; Morrison Coulthard, Lisa J; Reicher, Stephen D; Schacter, Daniel L; Sherman, Susan M; Simms, Victoria; Williams, Antony; Wykes, Til; Armitage, Christopher J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12468",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Br J Psychol;: e12468, 2020 Jul 19.; Publication details: Br J Psychol;: e12468, 2020 Jul 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Thus, we aimed to identify the psychological and behavioral responses and stressors of caregivers quarantined with young patients after a close contact to a coronavirus disease 2019 case at a children's hospital. More than 90% of the caregivers reported feelings of worry and nervousness, while some of them reported suicidal ideations (4.2%), and/or homicidal ideations (1.4%). Fear of infection of the patient (91.7%) and/or oneself (86.1%) were most frequently reported stressors. A multidisciplinary team including infection control team, pediatrician, psychiatrist, nursing staff and legal department provided supplies and services to reduce caregiver's psychological distress. Psychotropic medication was needed in five (6.9%), one of whom was admitted to the psychiatry department due to suicidality.

"Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public mental health. Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the I2 index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. RESULTS: The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 not only causes physical health concerns but also results in a number of psychological disorders. The spread of the new coronavirus can impact the mental health of people in different communities. Thus, it is essential to preserve the mental health of individuals and to develop psychological interventions that can improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Salari, Nader; Hosseinian-Far, Amin; Jalali, Rostam; Vaisi-Raygani, Aliakbar; Rasoulpoor, Shna; Mohammadi, Masoud; Rasoulpoor, Shabnam; Khaledi-Paveh, Behnam","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00589-w",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 57, 2020 07 06.; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 57, 2020 07 06.; Anxiety/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Depression/epidemiology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Asia/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Europe/epidemiology; Humans; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Prevalence; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Preexisting Comorbidities Predicting COVID-19 and Mortality in the UK Biobank Community Cohort","BACKGROUND: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients tend to be older and frequently have hypertension, diabetes or coronary heart disease (CHD), but whether these co-morbidities are true risk factors (i.e. more common than in the general older population) is unclear. We estimated associations between pre-existing diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality, in a large community cohort. METHODS: UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (16th March to 26th April 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. RESULTS: Of 269,070 participants aged 65+, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common co-morbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%) and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age-group, sex, ethnicity and education, pre-existing diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, COPD, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first five remaining statistically significant for related mortality. Chronic Kidney Disease and asthma were risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in women but not men. CONCLUSION: There are specific high risk pre-existing co-morbidities for COVID-19 hospitalization and related deaths in community based older men and women. These results do not support simple age-based targeting of the older population to prevent severe COVID-19 infections.","Atkins, Janice L; Masoli, Jane A H; Delgado, Joao; Pilling, Luke C; Kuo, Chia-Ling; Kuchel, George A; Melzer, David","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/gerona/glaa183",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci;2020 Jul 20.; Publication details: J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci;2020 Jul 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

METHODS: CNKI, China Medical Journal Network, PubMed and Embase databases were searched by computer, and TCM syndrome data of COVID-19 cross-sectional surveys and case series were collected from the establishment of the database to March 31st in 2020. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted relevant data such as TCM syndromes, and evaluated the quality of the literature according to the quality assessment tool recommended by the JBI Evidence-Based Health Care Center. Stata 14.0 software was used to perform a single-group Meta-analysis of TCM syndromes. RESULTS: Thirteen cross-sectional studies and 5 case series studies were included, with a total of 2 139 patients. The analysis of the cross-sectional studies showed that the risk bias was higher in the identification, control and accuracy of the confounding factors, and the description of the reliability and validity of the outcome indicators was unclear. The analysis of the case series studies showed that the overall risk bias was small, but there was a lack of a comprehensive description of the assessment when selecting patients. A total of 33 TCM syndromes of COVID-19 were sorted out by combining the TCM syndromes with the same disease position and pathogenic syndrome in the included 18 literatures, and there were 10 types of TCM syndromes of which the number of occurrences was &#8805; 50, the incidence rate was &#8805; 10%, and had statistical significance [indicated that 95% confidence interval (95%CI) didn't cross the meaningless line 0], including cold dampness syndrome (469 cases, incidence rate was 28.2%, 95%CI was 5.9%-50.6%), damp heat syndrome (247 cases, incidence rate was 32.1%, 95%CI was 10.7%-53.6%), epidemic closed lung syndrome (228 cases, incidence rate was 28.9%, 95%CI was 12.5%-45.2%), pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (202 cases, incidence rate was 22.1%, 95%CI was 9.5%-34.7%), dampness stagnation lung syndrome (180 cases, incidence rate was 41.2%, 95%CI was 18.4%-64.1%), dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome (81 cases, incidence rate was 56.3%, 95%CI was 48.1%-64.4%), evil heat syndrome lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%), dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome (70 cases, incidence rate was 13.4%, 95%CI was 10.4%-16.3%), heat poisoning lung closure syndrome (55 cases, incidence rate was 16.9%, 95%CI was 8.3%-25.5%), and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that there were 6 types of TCM syndromes that met the above conditions in cross-sectional studies, namely cold and damp lung syndrome (200 cases, incidence rate was 20.9%, 95%CI was 12.6%-29.2%), damp heat syndrome (221 cases, incidence rate was 41.8%, 95%CI was 9.4%-74.2%), dampness-disease lung syndrome (120 cases, incidence rate was 41.4%, 95%CI was 8.6%-74.3%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (115 cases, incidence rate was 19.2%, 95%CI was 6.8%-31.7%), heat-fever lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%) and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). There were 3 kinds of TCM syndromes in case series studies, which were virus closed lung syndrome (133 cases, incidence rate was 44.0%, 95%CI was 24.5%-63.4%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (87 cases, incidence rate was 38.7%, 95%CI was 32.3%-45.0%), and dampness and depression lung syndrome (60 cases, incidence rate was 40.6%, 95%CI was 29.3%-52.0%).

"Debate: Exposing the most serious infirmity-racism's impact on health in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic retells a story that other diseases like HIV, diabetes, and cancer have clearly internationally illustrated. Minorities in developed countries across the globe - especially those of African, Hispanic, and Native American descent - suffer a greater burden of disease than whites. The evidence of the cause and effect relationship of racism on mental and minority health outcomes is staggering. Racism and its influence on policy and important structural systems allow health inequities across racial and ethnic groups to persist. What's more troubling is how systemic racism impacts children from all races and has been perpetuated across many generations dating back hundreds of years. The impact of racial oppression is seen through intergenerational trauma which impacts youth in varying ways. For this article, we offer three areas in which racism causes healthcare disparities, intergenerational trauma, social determinants, and cultural mistrust. Effective policy change and a greater level of accountability must be placed on major systems including health care, to most fully counter racism's varied role in sustaining mental health inequities.","Farquharson, Wilfred H; Thornton, Carmen J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/camh.12407",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Jul 19.; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Jul 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Associations between COVID-19 related media consumption and symptoms of anxiety, depression and COVID-19 related fear in the general population in Germany","In context of the current COVID-19 pandemic the consumption of pandemic-related media coverage may be an important factor that is associated with anxiety and psychological distress. Aim of the study was to examine those associations in the general population in Germany. 6233 participants took part in an online-survey (March 27th-April 6th, 2020), which included demographic information and media exploitation in terms of duration, frequency and types of media. Symptoms of depression, unspecific anxiety and COVID-19 related anxiety were ascertained with standardized questionnaires. Frequency, duration and diversity of media exposure were positively associated with more symptoms of depression and unspecific and COVID-19 specific anxiety. We obtained the critical threshold of seven times per day and 2.5 h of media exposure to mark the difference between mild and moderate symptoms of (un)specific anxiety and depression. Particularly the usage of social media was associated with more pronounced psychological strain. Participants with pre-existing fears seem to be particularly vulnerable for mental distress related to more immoderate media consumption. Our findings provide some evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related media exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations-especially with regard to the thresholds of critical media usage.","Bendau, Antonia; Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Pyrkosch, Lena; Mascarell Maricic, Lea; Betzler, Felix; Rogoll, Janina; Große, Julia; Ströhle, Andreas; Plag, Jens","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01171-6",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci;2020 Jul 20.; Publication details: Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci;2020 Jul 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Anpassungsstörung, Depression, Stresssymptome, Corona bezogene Sorgen und Bewältigungsstrategien während der Corona Pandemie (COVID-19) bei Schweizer Klinikpersonal; [Adjustment Disorder, Depression, Stress Symptoms, Corona Related Anxieties and Coping Strategies during the Corona Pandemic (COVID-19) in Swiss Medical Staff]","BACKGROUND: International studies point to increased mental health problems of medical staff during the Corona pandemic (COVID-19). This is the first study to investigate mental health, i. e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. RESULTS: Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. DISCUSSION: Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.","Krammer, Sandy; Augstburger, Roland; Haeck, Martina; Maercker, Andreas","https://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1192-6608",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol;70(7): 272-282, 2020 Jul.; Publication details: Psychother Psychosom Med Psychol;70(7): 272-282, 2020 Jul.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychosocial and coping responses towards 2019 coronavirus diseases (COVID-19): a cross-sectional study within the Chinese general population","BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) led out the mental health crisis. AIM: To determine the psychological status and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSD) among general population (except confirmed and suspected cases, and close contacts) and their association with the coping strategy types during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community through snowball sampling with anonymous online questionnaires, using 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 28-item Brief Coping Inventory (COPE) to measure their psychiatric disorders, PTSD level, and coping strategies. RESULTS: Of the total 1109 participants, 42.65% and 67.09% self-reported psychiatric disorders and high PTSD level, respectively. Age, occupation, and education level were significantly association with psychological status. The status of psychiatric disorders was also significantly related to high PTSD level. Using both emotion and problem coping was better for psychiatric status (aOR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.98) and problem-focused coping was significantly associated with high PTSD level (aOR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.25-3.51).

"A projection for psychiatry in the post-COVID-19 era: potential trends, challenges, and directions","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the face of psychiatry over a very short time period. Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis.","Türközer, Halide Bilge; Öngür, Dost","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0841-2",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Mol Psychiatry;2020 Jul 17.; Publication details: Mol Psychiatry;2020 Jul 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This study was conducted to determine rates of COVID-19-related PTSD in the Irish general population, the level of comorbidity with depression and anxiety, and the sociodemographic risk factors associated with COVID-19-related PTSD. A nationally representative sample of adults from the general population of the Republic of Ireland (N = 1,041) completed self-report measures of all study variables. The rate of COVID-19-related PTSD was 17.7% (n = 184), 95% CI [15.35%, 19.99%], and there was a high level of comorbidity with generalized anxiety (49.5%) and depression (53.8%).

"Perceived Threat of COVID-19 Contagion and Frontline Paramedics' Agonistic Behaviour: Employing a Stressor-Strain-Outcome Perspective","Historically, infectious diseases have been the leading cause of human psychosomatic strain and death tolls. This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor-strain-outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion. These findings significantly contributed to the current literature concerning COVID-19 and pandemic-related effects on human behaviour. This study also theorized the concept of human agonistic behaviour, which has key implications for future researchers.","Shahzad, Fakhar; Du, Jianguo; Khan, Imran; Fateh, Adnan; Shahbaz, Muhammad; Abbas, Adnan; Wattoo, Muhammad Umair","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145102",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 15.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Minimizing the aerosol-generating procedures in orthodontics in the era of a pandemic: Current evidence on the reduction of hazardous effects for the treatment team and patients","The purpose of this critical review is to list the sources of aerosol production during orthodontic standard procedure, analyze the constituent components of aerosol and their dependency on modes of grinding, the presence of water and type of bur, and suggest a method to minimize the quantity and detrimental characteristics of the particles comprising the solid matter of aerosol. Minimization of water-spray syringe utilization for rinsing is suggested on bonding related procedures, while temporal conditions as represented by seasonal epidemics should be considered for the decision of intervention scheme provided as a preprocedural mouth rinse, in an attempt to reduce the load of aerosolized pathogens. In normal conditions, chlorhexidine 0.2%, preferably under elevated temperature state should be prioritized for reducing bacterial counts. In the presence of oxidation vulnerable viruses within the community, substitute strategies might be represented by the use of povidone iodine 0.2%-1%, or hydrogen peroxide 1%. After debonding, extensive material grinding, as well as aligner related attachment clean-up, should involve the use of carbide tungsten burs under water cooling conditions for cutting efficiency enhancement, duration restriction of the procedure, as well as reduction of aerosolized nanoparticles. In this respect, selection strategies of malocclusions eligible for aligner treatment should be reconsidered and future perspectives may entail careful and more restricted utilization of attachment grips. For more limited clean-up procedures, such as grinding of minimal amounts of adhesive remnants, or individualized bracket debonding in the course of treatment, hand-instruments for remnant removal might well represent an effective strategy. Efforts to minimize the use of rotary instrumentation in orthodontic settings might also lead the way for future solutions. Measures of self-protection for the treatment team should never be neglected. Dressing gowns and facemasks with filter protection layers, appropriate ventilation and fresh air flow within the operating room comprise significant links to the overall picture of practice management. Risk management considerations should be constant, but also updated as new material applications come into play, while being grounded on the best available evidence.","Eliades, Theodore; Koletsi, Despina","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.06.002",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop;2020 Jul 16.; Publication details: Am J Orthod Dentofacial Orthop;2020 Jul 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: To date, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. METHODS: Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. RESULTS: In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53-36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27-32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants' self-reported safety scores for HCW's protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ying, Yuchen; Ruan, Liemin; Kong, Fanqian; Zhu, Binbin; Ji, Yunxin; Lou, Zhongze","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02784-w",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 379, 2020 07 17.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 379, 2020 07 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This study examines youth mental health and substance use during the pandemic period. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 622 youth participants across existing clinical and community cohorts. Using the National Institute of Mental Health-developed CRISIS tool and other measures, participants reported on the impacts of COVID-19 on their mental health, substance use, and other constructs. RESULTS: Reports of prepandemic mental health compared to intrapandemic mental health show a statistically significant deterioration of mental health across clinical and community samples (P < 0.001), with greater deterioration in the community sample. A total of 68.4% of youth in the clinical sample and 39.9% in the community sample met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder. Substance use declined in both clinical and community samples (P < 0.001), although 23.2% of youth in the clinical sample and 3.0% in the community sample met screening criteria for a substance use disorder. Participants across samples report substantial mental health service disruptions (48.7% and 10.8%) and unmet support needs (44.1% and 16.2%). Participants report some positive impacts, are using a variety of coping strategies to manage their wellness, and shared a variety of ideas of strategies to support youth during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Among youth with histories of mental health concerns, the pandemic context poses a significant risk for exacerbation of need. In addition, youth may experience the onset of new difficulties. We call on service planners to attend to youth mental health during COVID-19 by bolstering the accessibility of services. Moreover, there is an urgent need to engage young people as coresearchers to understand and address the impacts of the pandemic and the short, medium, and long terms.","Hawke, Lisa D; Barbic, Skye Pamela; Voineskos, Aristotle; Szatmari, Peter; Cleverley, Kristin; Hayes, Em; Relihan, Jacqueline; Daley, Mardi; Courtney, Darren; Cheung, Amy; Darnay, Karleigh; Henderson, Joanna L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0706743720940562",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720940562, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720940562, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Identifying Moral Injury in Healthcare Professionals: The Moral Injury Symptom Scale-HP","This study aims to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a measure of moral injury (MI) symptoms for identifying clinically significant MI in health professionals (HPs), one that might be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. A cutoff score was identified from a receiver operator curve (ROC) that best identified individuals with significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The 10-item MISS-HP measures 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10-100). Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. PCA identified three factors, which was confirmed by CFA, explaining 56.8% of the variance. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by modest correlations (r's = 0.25-0.37) with low religiosity, depression, and anxiety symptoms, whereas convergent validity was evident by strong correlations with clinician burnout (r = 0.57) and with another multi-item measure of MI symptoms (r = 0.65). ROC characteristics indicated that a score of 36 or higher was 84% sensitive and 93% specific for identifying MI symptoms causing moderate to extreme problems with family, social, and occupational functioning. The MISS-HP is a reliable and valid measure of moral injury symptoms in health professionals that can be used in clinical practice to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment, as well as when conducting research that evaluates interventions to treat MI in HPs.","Mantri, Sneha; Lawson, Jennifer Mah; Wang, ZhiZhong; Koenig, Harold G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01065-w",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Relig Health;2020 Jul 17.; Publication details: J Relig Health;2020 Jul 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9&#8805;5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7&#8805;5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI&#8805;8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß=0.313, P<0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß=0.411, P<0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß=0.358, P=0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (ß=0.163, P=0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß=0.101, P=0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.","Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Brain Behav Immun;2020 Jul 15.; Publication details: Brain Behav Immun;2020 Jul 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Environmental health workforce - essential for interdisciplinary solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic","Interdisciplinary public health solutions are vital for an effective COVID-19 response and recovery. However, there is often a lack of awareness and understanding of the environmental health workforce capabilities. In the United States, this is a foundational function of health departments and is the second largest public health workforce. The primary role is to protect the public from exposures to environmental hazards, disasters and disease outbreaks. More specifically, this includes addressing risks relating to sanitation, drinking water, food safety, vector control and mass gatherings. This profession is also recognized in the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019. Despite this, the entire profession is often not considered an essential service. Rapid integration into COVID-19 activities can easily occur as most are government employees and experienced working in complex and stressful situations. This role, for example, could include working with leaders, businesses, workplaces and churches to safely reopen, and inspections to inform, educate, and empower employers, employees and the public on safe actions.

"COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: cause of sleep disruption, depression, somatic pain, and increased screen exposure of office workers and students of India","COVID-19 has brought the world into uncharted waters. Many countries are under lockdown, the economy has ground to a halt, and almost everyone is afraid of dire consequences. The unprecedented changes that came on so quickly due to the pandemic and stay-at-home confinement to accomplish social distancing and mitigate risk for infection pose many challenges. These include compromised health, well-being, and sleep as a consequence of disruption of the daily life routine, anxiety, worry, isolation, greater family and work stress, and excessive screen time. Our study of 203 corporate sector professionals performing '9-5' work from home during this phase of the pandemic and of 325 undergraduate and postgraduate university students substantiates, relative to the before lockdown condition, more extensive feelings of sleepiness, with significantly (p < .05) increased daytime nap duration, and depressive symptomatology (p < .001) that is a matter of concern. Moreover, the chronic stress of living through a pandemic led to a host of physical symptoms, like headaches, insomnia, digestive problems, hormonal imbalances, and fatigue.","Majumdar, Piya; Biswas, Ankita; Sahu, Subhashis","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1786107",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Chronobiol Int;: 1-10, 2020 Jul 13.; Publication details: Chronobiol Int;: 1-10, 2020 Jul 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Breath Regulation and yogic Exercise An online Therapy for calm and Happiness (BREATH) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. MAIN OUTCOMES: The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. RANDOMISATION: Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility. We will use REDCap to perform randomization in a 1:1 ratio as well as allocation concealment. REDCap is widely used by health researchers worldwide to significantly reduce data entry and study management errors to improve data fidelity. BLINDING (MASKING): All study participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses so as to prevent any expectation bias. Group allocation will be masked during analysis. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This study will randomize a total of 60 participants in a 1:1 ratio to either SKY or HEP interventions. TRIAL STATUS: Protocol version number 2.0 (June 5, 2020). Recruitment is currently ongoing (starting June 25, 2020). We anticipate to complete recruitment by June 30, 2021 and complete the study by September 30, 2021. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov protocol ID NCT04368676 (posted April 30, 2020).

With the UK being placed in lockdown one week before a scheduled 'face-to-face' low-intensity CBT training day due to COVID-19, there was a need for rapid adaptations to be made to the content, structure and format of a training day for practitioners in mental health services, to suit the online environment. The content covered the core areas of low-intensity CBT in children and adolescents. Findings showed that the one-day low-intensity training day increased knowledge and understanding in all key areas measured, and was positively received, providing further evidence for the effectiveness and acceptability of remote delivery. Given discussed benefits of remote delivery, as well as rapid developments in technologies helping to address some of the challenges raised, going forward, remote delivery could continue to be beneficial for increasing access to much needed evidence-based interventions.","Batchelor, Rachel; Catanzano, Matteo; Kerry, Ellie; Bennett, Sophie D; Coughtrey, Anna E; Liang, Holan; Curry, Vicki; Heyman, Isobel; Shafran, Roz","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/camh.12402",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Jul 16.; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Jul 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society","The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

"Mental health of orthopaedic trauma patients during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","PURPOSE: The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been associated with reports of increased anxiety, depression and fear among the general population. People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. RESULTS: The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, p < 0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019. Stress induced by the coronavirus pandemic can place patients with mental illness at a higher risk for perilous behaviours and subsequent fractures.","Ohliger, Erin; Umpierrez, Erica; Buehler, Lauren; Ohliger, Andrew W; Magister, Steven; Vallier, Heather; Hirschfeld, Adam G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04711-w",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int Orthop;2020 Jul 16.; Publication details: Int Orthop;2020 Jul 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental Health and Work Attitudes among People Resuming Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in China","The unprecedented outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused an economic downturn and increased the unemployment rate in China. In this context, employees face health and social economic stressors. To assess their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization) and work attitudes (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction and turnover intention) as well as the associated factors, we conducted a cross-sectional study among people who resumed work after the Spring Festival holiday during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization among these people was 12.7%, 13.5%, 20.7% and 6.6%, respectively. The major risk factor for mental health was worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were psychological strengths (i.e., resilience and optimism). Regarding work attitudes, the percentage of people who felt more satisfied with their job (43.8%) was larger than that of those who felt less satisfied (26.9%), while the percentage of people who thought about quitting their job more frequently (15.7%) was smaller than that of those who considered it less frequently (63.2%). However, work engagement was lower than usual. Similar to the factors associated with mental health, the major risk factor for work attitudes was also worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were resilience and optimism. In addition, the nature of the organization, job status, age, position and income changes were also related to these work attitudes. Our findings shed light on the need for organization administrators to be aware of the status of and factors associated with employees' mental health and work attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies or interventions could be developed based on our findings.","Song, Lili; Wang, Yong; Li, ZhengLin; Yang, Ying; Li, Hao","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145059",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 14.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","BACKGROUND: On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. STUDY DESIGN: A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. RESULTS: Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. CONCLUSION: Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.","Wu, Yanting; Zhang, Chen; Liu, Han; Duan, Chenchi; Li, Cheng; Fan, Jianxia; Li, Hong; Chen, Lei; Xu, Hualin; Li, Xiangjuan; Guo, Yi; Wang, Yeping; Li, Xiufeng; Li, Jing; Zhang, Ting; You, Yiping; Li, Hongmei; Yang, Shuangqi; Tao, Xiaoling; Xu, Yajuan; Lao, Haihong; Wen, Ming; Zhou, Yan; Wang, Junying; Chen, Yuhua; Meng, Diyun; Zhai, Jingli; Ye, Youchun; Zhong, Qinwen; Yang, Xiuping; Zhang, Dan; Zhang, Jing; Wu, Xifeng; Chen, Wei; Dennis, Cindy-Lee; Huang, He-Feng","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 May 11.; Publication details: Am J Obstet Gynecol;2020 May 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Social Distancing among Medical Students during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in China: Disease Awareness, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and Behavioral Activities","BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, harsh social distancing measures were taken in China to contain viral spread. We examined their impact on the lives of medical students. METHODS: A nation-wide cross-sectional survey of college students was conducted from 4-12 February 2020. We enrolled medical students studying public health in Beijing and Wuhan to assess their COVID-19 awareness and to evaluate their mental health status/behaviors using a self-administered questionnaire. We used the Patient Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Health Questionnaire-9 to measure anxiety disorders and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression and path analysis to assess the associations between covariates and anxiety disorder/depression. RESULTS: Of 933 students, 898 (96.2%) reported wearing masks frequently when going out, 723 (77.5%) reported daily handwashing with soap, 676 (72.5%) washed hands immediately after arriving home, and 914 (98.0%) reported staying home as much as possible. Prevalence of anxiety disorder was 17.1% and depression was 25.3%. Multivariable logistic regression showed anxiety to be associated with graduate student status (odds ratio (aOR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.5), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-1.7), and feeling depressed (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI: 4.0-11.7). Beijing students were significantly less likely to have anxiety than those in the Wuhan epicenter (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8-1.0), but depression did not differ. Depression was associated with female students (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.3), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.9), and anxiety disorder (aOR = 5.8; 95% CI: 3.4-9.9). Path analysis validated these same predictors. CONCLUSIONS: Despite medical students' knowledge of disease control and prevention, their lives were greatly affected by social distancing, especially in the Wuhan epicenter. Even well-informed students needed psychological support during these extraordinarily stressful times.","Xiao, Huidi; Shu, Wen; Li, Menglong; Li, Ziang; Tao, Fangbiao; Wu, Xiaoyan; Yu, Yizhen; Meng, Heng; Vermund, Sten H; Hu, Yifei","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145047",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 14.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 severity, self-efficacy, knowledge, preventive behaviors, and mental health in Turkey","This study tested whether the levels of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity, self-efficacy, knowledge, and preventive behaviors predicted mental health. Participants were 3190 Turkish adults (50% women; M age = 38.76, SD = 10.43 years) who completed online self-reported questionnaires. Most participants (55.11-64.42%) had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and were highly engaged in preventive behaviors.

"Exercise and screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The objective of this paper is to describe the exercise and changes in screen time habits, and their relationship with health, among participants of the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS). DATA AND METHODS: Between March 29th and April 3rd 2020, CPSS participants (n = 4,524) reported whether they were exercising outdoors or indoors and whether they increased, decreased or maintained their TV, Internet and video game use. Participants also reported their self-perceived general and mental health. RESULTS: More women reported very good or excellent mental health if they were exercising outdoors (54%) compared with those who were not (41%). More women reported very good or excellent general health if they were exercising outdoors (75%) compared with those who were not (49%), with the same trend evident for those exercising indoors (69%) compared to those who were not (62%). More men (65%) and women (62%) rated their mental and general health as very good or excellent if they maintained or decreased TV time compared with those who increased TV time (57% and 43%, respectively), with the same evident for Internet use in women only (maintained/decreased: 61% versus increased: 44%). More men (63%) and women (52%) rated their mental health as very good or excellent if they maintained or decreased video game time compared with those who increased video game time (48% and 29%, respectively). More men and women reported very good or excellent mental and general health if they increased none or one type of screen and/or were exercising outdoors compared with those who increased 2 or 3 types of screens and who were not exercising outdoors, with the exception of general health among men. DISCUSSION: Maintaining opportunities for outdoor exercise and limiting screen time may promote better mental and general health during periods of confinement.","Colley, Rachel C; Bushnik, Tracey; Langlois, Kellie","https://dx.doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000600001-eng",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Rep;31(6): 3-11, 2020 07 15.; Publication details: Health Rep;31(6): 3-11, 2020 07 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Negative cognitive and psychological correlates of mandatory quarantine during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China","Quarantine plays a key role in controlling the pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

"Quality of sleep and health-related quality of life among health care professionals treating patients with coronavirus disease-19","BACKGROUND: Health care professionals exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are facing high levels of stress. AIM: The aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep (QoS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among health care professionals treating patients with COVID-19, as well as quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression and levels of anxiety. METHODS: We included 201 health care professionals in a cross-sectional, web-based study by applying 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, 36-item Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and additional survey constructed for the purpose of the study. RESULTS: Health care workers who treated COVID-19 patients were more afraid of becoming infected or of transmitting the infection to a family member with a significantly low self-assessment of their mental status. Poor QoS and HRQoL correlated with high health anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and several demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher scores on GAD-7 (beta = .71, p < .01) and lower scores on mental health (MH) subscale on SF36 questionnaire (beta = -.69; p < .01) were independent predictors of the higher PSQI score (adjusted R2 = .61, p < .01 for overall model). Higher scores on GAD-7 (beta = .68, p < .01) and worse self-perceived mental status (beta = .25; p < .05) were independent predictors of the lower SF36 scores (adjusted R2 = .73, p < .01 for overall model). CONCLUSION: The major MH burden of health care professionals treating infected patients during the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that they need psychological support.","Stojanov, Jelena; Malobabic, Marina; Stanojevic, Goran; Stevic, Milos; Milosevic, Vuk; Stojanov, Aleksandar","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020942800",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020942800, 2020 Jul 16.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020942800, 2020 Jul 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How to prevent in-hospital COVID-19 infection and reassure women about the safety of pregnancy: Experience from an obstetric center in China","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the emergency responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for pregnant patients at our hospital and their effect on hospital operations and patients' outcomes. METHODS: We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed and the patients' characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. RESULTS: No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological interventions showed optimistic effects in ameliorating depression and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Our strategies were effective in preventing in-hospital infection of COVID-19 and reassuring women about the safety of pregnancy. Monitoring and managing psychological issues were necessary during this critical period.","Gu, Xiao-Xia; Chen, Kai; Yu, Hong; Liang, Ge-Yu; Chen, Hui; Shen, Yang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300060520939337",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Int Med Res;48(7): 300060520939337, 2020 Jul.; Publication details: J Int Med Res;48(7): 300060520939337, 2020 Jul.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study of Perinatal Risk and Resilience During COVID-19","Introduction/Objectives: National guidelines underscore the need for improvement in the detection and treatment of mood disorders in the perinatal period. Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. Methods: The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. Results: Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines. Conclusions: Since the onset of COVID-19, many pregnant and postpartum women report struggling with stress, depression, and anxiety symptomatology. Findings from this pilot study begin to inform future intervention work to best support this highly vulnerable population.","Farewell, Charlotte V; Jewell, Jennifer; Walls, Jessica; Leiferman, Jenn A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/2150132720944074",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Prim Care Community Health;11: 2150132720944074, 2020.; Publication details: J Prim Care Community Health;11: 2150132720944074, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Factors contributing to the distress, concerns, and needs of UK Neuroscience health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 research from China suggests health care workers are at risk of distress, have specific concerns, and need support. It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high incidence of psychological distress in UK health care staff. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued are influenced by individual staff characteristics. Stratified, one-to-one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches for stress reduction and resilience, are crucial.","Cipolotti, Lisa; Chan, Edgar; Murphy, Patrick; van Harskamp, Natasja; Foley, Jennifer A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/papt.12298",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Psychother;: e12298, 2020 Jul 16.; Publication details: Psychol Psychother;: e12298, 2020 Jul 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 Outbreak and Management Approach for Families with Children on Long-Term Kidney Replacement Therapy","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: During the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the treatment of families with children on long-term KRT is challenging. This study was conducted to identify the current difficulties, worries regarding the next 2 months, and mental distress experienced by families with children on long-term KRT during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and to deliver possible management approaches to ensure uninterrupted treatment for children on long-term KRT. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: A multicenter online survey was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, among the families with children on long-term KRT from five major pediatric dialysis centers in mainland China. The primary caregivers of children currently on long-term KRT were eligible and included. Demographic information, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status, current difficulties, and worries regarding the next 2 months were surveyed using a self-developed questionnaire. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 were used to screen for depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: Among the children in the 220 families included in data analysis, 113 (51%) children were on dialysis, and the other 107 (49%) had kidney transplants. No families reported confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019. Overall, 135 (61%) and 173 (79%) caregivers reported having difficulties now and having worries regarding the next 2 months, respectively. Dialysis supply shortage (dialysis group) and hard to have blood tests (kidney transplantation group) were most commonly reported. A total of 29 (13%) caregivers had depressive symptoms, and 24 (11%) had anxiety. After the survey, we offered online and offline interventions to address their problems. At the time of the submission of this paper, no treatment interruption had been reported.

"Attitudes, Anxiety, and Behavioral Practices Regarding COVID-19 among University Students in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health, economic, political, and scientific concern in most countries around the globe where COVID-19 cases and deaths have been confirmed. This study assessed the attitudes, anxiety, and behavioral practices of university students in Jordan regarding COVID-19 during the early period of the infection (March 19-21, 2020) using a validated, self-administered survey questionnaire. Positive attitudes or low-risk practices were given 1 point, whereas negative attitudes or high-risk practices were scored 0. Percentages of the total score were used for categorizing data into negative attitudes or high-risk practices (&#8804; 60%), moderate attitudes or moderate-risk practices (60.01-80%), and positive attitudes or low-risk practices (> 80%). Generally, the university students displayed positive attitudes and low-risk practices toward preventing COVID-19, with an average score of 81.1% and 84.3%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds (69.1%) of the students showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19 seriousness, concern of contracting the virus, and the appropriate prevention measures, and low-risk practices (67.6%) toward preventing COVID-19 including implementation of social distancing and good hygiene. Female, older, medical, or postgraduate students practiced significantly more (P &#8804; 0.05) appropriate hygiene and social distancing behaviors toward COVID-19 than their counterparts of each group. More than two-thirds (69.2%) of the students were anxious that they might become infected with COVID-19. These results are important for health authorities to develop appropriate educational programs and protective health measures including good respiratory etiquette and handwashing practices, to enhance safer lifestyles and prevent COVID-19 transmission.","Olaimat, Amin N; Aolymat, Iman; Elsahoryi, Nour; Shahbaz, Hafiz M; Holley, Richard A","https://dx.doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0418",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Trop Med Hyg;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Am J Trop Med Hyg;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Anxiety and depression and its correlates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan","OBJECTIVES: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke-out in Wuhan China in December 2019, and spread throughout the entire country within a short time. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Female patients were associated with higher risk of depression. Patients with family members diagnosed as COVID-19 or died from this disease were associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.","Nie, Xue-Dan; Wang, Qin; Wang, Min-Nan; Zhao, Shuai; Liu, Lei; Zhu, Yu-Lan; Chen, Hong","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2020.1791345",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract;: 1-6, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract;: 1-6, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Addressing the Problem of Severe Underinvestment in Mental Health and Well-Being from a Human Rights Perspective","Throughout the world, mental health remains a neglected priority, low on the agenda of policy makers and funders at the national and international levels. While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions-which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience-there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to ""scale up"" mental health and to reduce ""treatment gaps"" are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed, Faraaz","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+the+Problem+of+Severe+Underinvestment+in+Mental+Health+and+Well-Being+from+a+Human+Rights+Perspective.",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Hum Rights;22(1): 35-49, 2020 Jun.; Publication details: Health Hum Rights;22(1): 35-49, 2020 Jun.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Modeling Spatiotemporal Pattern of Depressive Symptoms Caused by COVID-19 Using Social Media Data Mining","By 29 May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had spread to 188 countries, infecting more than 5.9 million people, and causing 361,249 deaths. Governments issued travel restrictions, gatherings of institutions were cancelled, and citizens were ordered to socially distance themselves in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Fear of being infected by the virus and panic over job losses and missed education opportunities have increased people's stress levels. Psychological studies using traditional surveys are time-consuming and contain cognitive and sampling biases, and therefore cannot be used to build large datasets for a real-time depression analysis. In this article, we propose a CorExQ9 algorithm that integrates a Correlation Explanation (CorEx) learning algorithm and clinical Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) lexicon to detect COVID-19 related stress symptoms at a spatiotemporal scale in the United States. The proposed algorithm overcomes the common limitations of traditional topic detection models and minimizes the ambiguity that is caused by human interventions in social media data mining. The results show a strong correlation between stress symptoms and the number of increased COVID-19 cases for major U.S. cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Miami. The results also show that people's risk perception is sensitive to the release of COVID-19 related public news and media messages. Between January and March, fear of infection and unpredictability of the virus caused widespread panic and people began stockpiling supplies, but later in April, concerns shifted as financial worries in western and eastern coastal areas of the U.S. left people uncertain of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives.","Li, Diya; Chaudhary, Harshita; Zhang, Zhe","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144988",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 10.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 10.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Data Mining; Depression/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Social Media; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Humans; Pandemics; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uncertainty; United States; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This study examines youth mental health and substance use during the pandemic period. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 622 youth participants across existing clinical and community cohorts. Using the National Institute of Mental Health-developed CRISIS tool and other measures, participants reported on the impacts of COVID-19 on their mental health, substance use, and other constructs. RESULTS: Reports of prepandemic mental health compared to intrapandemic mental health show a statistically significant deterioration of mental health across clinical and community samples (P < 0.001), with greater deterioration in the community sample. A total of 68.4% of youth in the clinical sample and 39.9% in the community sample met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder. Substance use declined in both clinical and community samples (P < 0.001), although 23.2% of youth in the clinical sample and 3.0% in the community sample met screening criteria for a substance use disorder. Participants across samples report substantial mental health service disruptions (48.7% and 10.8%) and unmet support needs (44.1% and 16.2%). Participants report some positive impacts, are using a variety of coping strategies to manage their wellness, and shared a variety of ideas of strategies to support youth during the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Among youth with histories of mental health concerns, the pandemic context poses a significant risk for exacerbation of need. In addition, youth may experience the onset of new difficulties. We call on service planners to attend to youth mental health during COVID-19 by bolstering the accessibility of services. Moreover, there is an urgent need to engage young people as coresearchers to understand and address the impacts of the pandemic and the short, medium, and long terms.","Hawke, Lisa D; Barbic, Skye Pamela; Voineskos, Aristotle; Szatmari, Peter; Cleverley, Kristin; Hayes, Em; Relihan, Jacqueline; Daley, Mardi; Courtney, Darren; Cheung, Amy; Darnay, Karleigh; Henderson, Joanna L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0706743720940562",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720940562, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720940562, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Commentary: An integrated blueprint for digital mental health services amidst COVID-19","UNSTRUCTURED: In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing difficulties amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Recent social distancing has revamped the attention on non-traditional mental health care delivery to overcome the difficult access to services and fill the void. Tele-health has been established for several decades but has only been able to fill a small gap in services. Mental health mobile and tele-digital health complements are well poised to respond to the upsurge of COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first aid resources and targeting interventions. Of concern is the rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained unlicensed professionals whom may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members to adjust to stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking of mental health (with real-time automation and machine learning) in general populations as well as consideration and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, Luke; De Leo, Diego","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21718",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This study aimed to compare prevalence rates of anxiety disorder and depressive disorder in national samples in the U.S. before and during the pandemic. METHODS: Participants (n = 336,525) were from U.S. Census Bureau-administered nationally representative probability samples, one from the first half of 2019 and four during the pandemic in April and May 2020. All participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 screening for depressive disorder and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 screening for anxiety disorders. RESULTS: Compared to U.S. adults in 2019, U.S. adults in April and May 2020 were more than three times as likely to screen positive for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, or one or both, with more than one out of three screening positive for one or both. The prevalence of anxiety decreased slightly between the April 23-May 4, 2020 and the May 21-26, 2020 administrations, while the prevalence of depression increased slightly.

"Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project","BACKGROUND: Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. METHOD: We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1st 2020. RESULTS: Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. LIMITATIONS: Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified.

"Living in the midst of fear: Depressive symptomatology among US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The current study examines interrelationships between social vulnerability, individual stressors, social and psychological resources, and depressive symptomatology among US adults during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (n = 10,368 adults) is used in the analysis. RESULTS: On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one-third of respondents had CES-D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID-19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction. CONCLUSIONS: In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis. Results highlight the significance of vulnerability and individual stressors in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the analysis affirms the importance of access to social and psychological resources to combat heightened fear and anxiety that persons report during the current pandemic.","Fitzpatrick, Kevin M; Harris, Casey; Drawve, Grant","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/da.23080",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Depress Anxiety;2020 Jul 15.; Publication details: Depress Anxiety;2020 Jul 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A health care workers mental health crisis line in the age of COVID-19","INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a health care crisis of unparalleled devastation. A mental health crisis as a second wave has begun to emerge in our front-line health care workers. OBJECTIVE: To address these needs, The Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, based on crisis intervention principles, was developed and launched in 2 weeks. METHODS: Upon reflection of why this worked, we decided it might be useful to describe what we now recognize as 13-steps which led to our success. The process included the following: (1) anticipate mental health needs; (2) use leadership capable of mobilizing the systems and resources; (3) convene a multidisciplinary team; (4) delegate tasks and set timelines; (5) choose a clinical service model; (6) motivate staff as a workforce of volunteers; (7) develop training and educational materials; (8) develop personal, local, and national resources; (9) develop marketing plans; (10) deliver the training; (11) launch a 24 hr/7days per week Healthcare Worker Mental Health COVID-19 Hotline, and launch follow-up sessions for staff; (12) structure data collection to determine effectiveness and outcomes; and (13) obtain funding (not required). DISCUSSION: We believe the process we used is specifically useful for others who may want to develop a COVID-19 hotline services for health care workers and generally useful for the development of other mental health services. CONCLUSION: We hope that this process may serve as a guide for other heath care systems.","Feinstein, Robert E; Kotara, Sussann; Jones, Barbara; Shanor, Donna; Nemeroff, Charles B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/da.23073",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Depress Anxiety;2020 Jul 15.; Publication details: Depress Anxiety;2020 Jul 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Significant resources have been dedicated to it. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, when compared to the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable rise in covid infections with its gradual relaxation continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on the same especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operation theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice all over the country. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. RESULTS: A total of 176 responses were received from all over the Indian Sub-Continent. The median age of respondents was 39years (range 32-70 yrs) and the post-residency experience was 7years (range 0-34 yrs). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. 46% of the respondents were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (p=0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services(26% vs 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N-95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practised precautionary measures in outpatient services(>60%). While private practitioners were continuing elective cases(40%), public institutes were more cautious with only emergencies being operated(29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to the family (75%). Social media was helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats upon social media platforms(37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. CONCLUSION: The survey highlights the perception of the neurosurgeons towards the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of the regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal OPD/OR practices and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by PPE usage and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Though telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, yet online education has been favourably received.","Deora, Harsh; Mishra, Shashwat; Tripathi, Manjul; Garg, Kanwaljeet; Tandon, Vivek; Borkar, Sachin; Varshney, Nagesh; Raut, Rupesh; Chaurasia, Bipin; Chandra, P Sarat; Kale, S S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: World Neurosurg;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: World Neurosurg;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: Early outpatient experiences and implications for the future","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U S  healthcare landscape  Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact  In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19  We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual  Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers  Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future","Chen, Justin A.; Chung, Wei-Jean; Young, Sarah K.; Tuttle, Margaret C.; Collins, Michelle B.; Darghouth, Sarah L.; Longley, Regina; Levy, Raymond; Razafsha, Mahdi; Kerner, Jeffrey C.; Wozniak, Janet; Huffman, Jeff C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2020.; Publication details: General Hospital Psychiatry;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"PSYCOVID-19, psychological support device in the fields of mental health, somatic and medico-social; PSYCOVID-19, dispositif de soutien psychologique dans les champs de la santé mentale, du somatique et du médico-social","In December 2019 the World Health Organization (WHO) recorded the first cases of an infectious disease that appeared in China in November of the same year. Generated by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV2, it is quickly named COVID-19 for COronaVirus Infectious Disease 2019. The spread of this unknown disease will soon have worldwide consequences: the contagiousness of the virus is extremely high and potentially lethal. In France, the population initially reacted with disbelief until the disease reached Europe and the first cases appeared on French territory, at the end of January. A few weeks later, on 16 March 2020, President Macron declared the country “at war” against COVID-19. The next day the population was placed in lockdown. At the present time, the country's activity is at a standstill. Schools, businesses and shops are closed. The French citizens are astounded. They suddenly have to face fear: fear of falling ill or that a close relative may fall ill, fear of being locked up and experiencing restrictions of liberties, fear of economic precariousness. And, above all, fear of uncertainty. In order to prevent the mental consequences of this crisis, psychological support units have been created with urgency at national scale. These units are intended to support the healthcare professionals as well as the patients and more broadly, the general population. The unit responsible for the department of Gironde has been set up quickly, over the weekend of March 21, 2020. The COVIDPSY33 listening unit has thus been created in Bordeaux by the Charles Perrens Hospital with support from the Agence Régionale de Santé Nouvelle-Aquitaine (ARS). Simultaneously, the PSYCOVID-19 unit was created. This additional unit works in collaboration with the COVIDPSY33 platform and offers psychological assistance to the general population and caregivers in the sectors of Bordeaux Rive Droite, Bordeaux Gare, Rives de Garonne, Rives d'Arcins and Sud Gironde. It thus covers an area equivalent to approximately half of Gironde, the largest department in metropolitan France.

"The Well-Being Index (WBI) for schools: A brief measure of adolescents' mental health","Schools are increasingly concerned with the well-being of the whole child - likely, more so since the COVID-19 pandemic - and goals here were to document the psychometric properties of a brief new measure of adolescent mental health, the Well-Being Index (WBI). The measure assesses 4 symptom areas, 2 each of internalizing and externalizing symptoms-Depression, Anxiety, Rule-Breaking, and Substance Use-and an optional scale on Isolation at School. A total of 2,444 students from 2 high schools completed the WBI, the Youth Self-Report (YSR), and other related measures. Alpha coefficients showed acceptable internal consistency, with values for the 5 WBI subscales at .83, .84, .78, .79, and .74, respectively. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated consistent factorial validity. Correlations with corresponding YSR subscales indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

"Tobacco smoking cessation in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Tobacco smoking is more prevalent among people who experience mental illness. It is therefore a prominent issue for psychiatric inpatient units. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many psychiatric inpatient units are no longer granting leave and outdoor smoking breaks, prompting the question of whether to allow tobacco smoking or enforce smoking bans in mental health services. There is currently mixed evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 cases, potentially due to current small sample sizes. Considering the benefits of smoking cessation in this vulnerable population, the current pandemic should be used as an opportunity to further enforce smoking cessation in mental health facilities and encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside cessation counseling.","Seiler, Natalie Kim; Swamy, Rajeev; Xiao, Junhua; Yun, Yang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1791379",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Addict Dis;: 1-3, 2020 Jul 12.; Publication details: J Addict Dis;: 1-3, 2020 Jul 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In March 2020, CoViD-19 was declared a pandemic, having spread all over the word. The psychological impact of CoViD-19 disease must be recognized alongside the physical symptoms for all those affected. Furhermore quarantine for coronavirus has serious psychological side effects, such as depression and anxiety that are more likely to occur and worsen. Furhermore quarantine reduces the availability of psychiatric and psychological interventions. The evidence base for telepsychiatry is growing in adults and adolescents.

"Responding to Health Care Professionals' Mental Health Needs During COVID-19 Through the Rapid Implementation of Project ECHO","OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic can cause significant mental health distress amongst health care professionals (HCPs). We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project ECHO Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs' manage COVID-19 distress. METHODS: We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. RESULTS: 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean=4.26). CONCLUSION: HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Clarkin, Chantalle; Serhal, Eva; Pereira, Cheryl; Crawford, Allison","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000311",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Contin Educ Health Prof;2020 Jul 09.; Publication details: J Contin Educ Health Prof;2020 Jul 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychosocial burden of healthcare professionals in times of COVID-19 - a survey conducted at the University Hospital Augsburg","Objective: The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Studies from China, where the virus first spread, have reported increased psychological strain in healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. Methods: Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. Results: Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that especially nurses working in COVID-19 wards are affected psychologically by the consequences of the pandemic. This might be due to a higher workload and longer time in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, compared to physicians.","Zerbini, Giulia; Ebigbo, Alanna; Reicherts, Philipp; Kunz, Miriam; Messman, Helmut","https://dx.doi.org/10.3205/000281",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ger Med Sci;18: Doc05, 2020.; Publication details: Ger Med Sci;18: Doc05, 2020.; Burnout, Professional/psychology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/therapy; Health Personnel/psychology; Occupational Stress/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/therapy; Workload/psychology; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Female; Germany; Hospitals, University; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses/psychology; Occupational Health; Occupational Stress/psychology; Pandemics/statistics & numerical data; Patient Care Team; Physicians/psychology; Psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; World Health Organization; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Objectives: This commentary highlights three plausible biological mechanisms for potentially worsened outcomes in patients with OUD who contract COVID-19. Results: Opioid-related respiratory depression may amplify risks of hypoxemia from COVID-19 viral pneumonia. Complex opioid immune modulation may impact host response to COVID-19, though the effect direction and clinical significance are unclear. Drug-drug interactions may affect individuals with OUD who are co-administered medications for OUD and medications for COVID-19, particularly due to cardiac adverse effects.

"Mental Health and Cancer: Why It Is Time to Innovate and Integrate-A Call to Action","Surgical, radio-oncological, and medical anti-cancer therapies have developed at pace and scale in recent years, yet there remains a huge unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Recent experience in the COVID-19 pandemic has added to recognition of this unmet need. There needs to be more effective clinical integration of relevant services, which must be informed by patient choice and clinical need, and accessible throughout the patient's whole cancer journey. This needs to be accompanied by training and research integration as well as more effective and creative use of technology such as virtual reality and simulation, quality assuring apps, and mobile technologies. Finally, as a clinical community we need to drive a shift in culture towards measurement of patient quality of life as a marker of treatment effectiveness. We also need to support our own clinical workforce with their own mental health needs so that we prevent the alarming rates of burnout prevalent among clinicians treating cancer. The call to action for innovation and staff support has been amplified by experience in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: This report highlights the unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Patients need effective access to psychological support and mental health services throughout their cancer journey, including better use of technology. There is also a need to support the psychological wellbeing of cancer clinicians.","Fernando, Asanga","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.06.025",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Urol Focus;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Eur Urol Focus;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

METHOD: Participants (Nâ<U+0080><U+008A>=â<U+0080><U+008A>474 employed U.S. individuals) completed an online survey from April 6-12, 2020. Linear regressions were used to examine factors associated with mental health. RESULTS: After accounting for demographic characteristics, health status, other COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety symptoms, greater job insecurity due to COVID-19 was related to greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Jenna M; Lee, Jerin; Fitzgerald, Holly N; Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Sevi, Baris; Shook, Natalie J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001962",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Occup Environ Med;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: J Occup Environ Med;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We describe families, students, professionals, promotoras (community links) and IT support staff joining together in solidarity as the creative problem solvers of new possibilities when families do not have access to Wifi, smart phones or computers, or suffer overcrowding and lack of privacy. We describe many anxieties related to economic insecurity or fear of facing death alone, but also how to visualize expanding possibilities in styles of parenting or types of emotional support among family members as elements of hope that may endure beyond these unprecedented tragic times of loss and uncertainty.","Falicov, Celia; Niño, Alba; D'Urso, Maria Sol","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/famp.12578",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Fam Process;2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Fam Process;2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: an evidence-based guidance for clinicians","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 presents unique challenges in healthcare, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face to face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to produce an open access, easy-to-consult and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and also other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarised the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. RESULTS: Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and a detailed table with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary tables are also available on an open access webpage (https://oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/our-work/oxppl/table-5-digital-technologies-and-telepsychiatry/) which is regularly updated. These findings reflect the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and include guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focussed on practical implementation, and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combination with other digital technologies such as apps, for example from the FDA, NHS Apps Library and NICE are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Whilst some special populations such as child and adolescent, older adult and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organisations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organisational change in the short and longer term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step, but will need cultural change to implement, as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement, but as a parallel and complimentary form of delivering therapy, with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19 and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and also its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Katharine; Ostinelli, Edoardo; Macdonald, Orla; Cipriani, Andrea","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21108",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;2020 Jul 10.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;2020 Jul 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Can social isolation caused by physical distance in people with psychosis be overcome through a Phone Pal?","The current pandemic has forced many people into self-isolation and to practice social distancing. When people are physically isolated and distant from each other, technology may play a fundamental role by enabling social connection and reducing feelings of loneliness caused by this prolonged social isolation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services worldwide have had to shift their routine face-to-face outpatient appointments to remote telepsychiatry encounters. The increased pressure on mental health services highlights the importance of community-led health-promotion interventions, which can contribute to preventing mental illness or their relapses, and to reduce the burden on health services. Patients with psychosis are particularly socially isolated, have sedentary lifestyles, and commonly face stigma and discrimination from the general population. At the same time, patients with psychosis value technology, are interested in, use and own smart-phones to digitally connect, and are satisfied with their use. Thus, among psychosocial interventions, a helpful resource may be ""Phone Pal,"" a complex intervention which facilitates remote communication between volunteers and socially isolated patients with psychosis through different smart-phone tools. While ""Phone Pal"" has been originally developed for people with psychosis, it may also be useful to the wider population, helping to overcome the social isolation caused by physical distancing, particularly in these times of widespread isolation. ""Phone Pal"" may be a potential public health resource for society, providing important support to those that may need it the most, and possibly benefit most from it.","Pinto da Costa, Mariana","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.53",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;63(1): e61, 2020 05 22.; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;63(1): e61, 2020 05 22.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Loneliness/psychology; Mental Health Services; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Psychotic Disorders/psychology; Smartphone; Social Isolation/psychology; Telemedicine/methods; Communication; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Pandemics; Social Stigma; Telemedicine/instrumentation; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Belief in Conspiracy Theory about COVID-19 Predicts Mental Health and Well-being: A Study of Healthcare Staff in Ecuador","BACKGROUND: Social media are becoming hotbeds of conspiracy theories, which aim to give resolute explanations on the cause of COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, no research has investigated whether individuals' belief in conspiracy theory about COVID-19 is associated with mental health and well-being issues. This association enables an assessable channel to identify and reach people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide the first evidence of belief in conspiracy theory regarding the COVID-19 virus as a predictor of the mental health and well-being of healthcare workers. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 252 healthcare workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data of distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and life and job satisfaction with linear regression. RESULTS: Among the sampled healthcare workers in Ecuador, 24.2% believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 32.54% experienced distress disorder, and 28.17% had anxiety disorder. Compared to healthcare workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to have distress disorder and anxiety disorder and had lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies belief in a COVID-19 conspiracy theory as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction of healthcare workers. It enables mental health services to better target and help mentally vulnerable healthcare workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Xi; Zhang, Stephen X; Jahanshahi, Asghar Afshar; Alvarez-Risco, Aldo; Dai, Huiyang; Li, Jizhen; Ibarra, Verónica García","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20737",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;2020 Jul 10.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;2020 Jul 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

To explore suicide risk, sleep, psychological status and influencing factors of coronavirus disease 2019 patients so as to provide corresponding countermeasures  Methods Subject were collected from January 2, 2020 to March 10, 2020 Infection group: 376 (95 males and 281 females) came from COVID-19 inpatients  Control group: 501 (110 men, 391 women) from non-COVID-19 population based on WeChat, public platform, circle of friends, etc  All of them were evaluated online and offline, self-evaluation and psychiatrist evaluation  The Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk scale (NGASR), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating depression scale (SDS) were applied  T test was conducted for age, the total score of suicide risk, PSQI, SAS, SDS and the factor score of PSQI of the two groups  Chi-square test was performed to sex, history of physical illness, provenance , abnormal incidence and severe incidence of suicide risk, sleep problem, anxiety, and depression of the two groups  Correlation analysis was carried out for age, the total score of suicide risk, SAS, SDS, PSQI and the factor score of PSQI in the infected group  Independent variables (gender, age, physical disease history, the total score of SDS, SAS and PSQI and the factor score of PSQI) and the dependent variable (The total score of suicide risk) of the infection group were assessed for multiple linear regression analysis (stepwise method)  SPSS 22 0 was used to complete data statistics  Results The incidence of moderate and above suicide risk, poor sleep quality, anxiety and depression were respectively 27 39%, 63 03%, 31 91%, 54 26% in the infected group and 7 98%, 33 53%, 9 18% and 21 36% in the control group, which was significantly different from the control group (p&lt;0 01)  The rates of high and high suicide risk, poor sleep quality, severe and severe anxiety, and severe and severe depression were respectively 9 57%, 12 23%, 4 79% and 7 98% in the infected group and 3 79%, 1 80%, 0 80% and 1 80% in the control group, which was significantly different from the control group (p&lt;0 01) The total score of suicide risk, PSQI, SAS, SDS and factor points of PSQI in the infected group were all higher than those in the control group, which was significantly different from the control group (p&lt;0 01) The total score of suicide risk, SAS, SDS, PSQI and factor points of PSQI in the infected group were positively correlated  The total score of suicide risk was also positively correlated with age  Age, anxiety, depression and poor sleep are major risk factors for suicide, among which poor sleep is the most important  Conclusions Patients with COVID-19 had severe sleep problems and psychological problems and a high risk of suicide;

"Risk factors for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel: Loneliness, age, gender, and health status play an important role","OBJECTIVE: Research on the psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being conducted in various countries. This study aimed to examine risk factors for mental health problems among Israeli adults during this crisis. METHODS: A total of 204 participants took part in the study. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and various questions related to quarantine, pre-existing health issues, and worries related to the virus. The study took place during the last two weeks of March 2020. RESULTS: The majority of participants reported relatively high levels of perceived stress and corona-related worries, but low levels of anxiety. Female gender, younger age, corona-related loneliness, and pre-existing chronic illness were all related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: While considering the preliminary nature of these results, the current study highlights risk factors for psychological distress in light of the corona pandemic. Attention should be given to sociodemographic variables that were identified as related to psychological distress, as well as to the important role of loneliness, when screening and treating people during this crisis. More research is needed in order to fully understand the scope and correlates of psychological difficulties during these challenging times.","Horesh, Danny; Kapel Lev-Ari, Rony; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12455",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Br J Health Psychol;2020 Jul 13.; Publication details: Br J Health Psychol;2020 Jul 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter","OBJECTIVE: We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. METHODS: During the period of May 1-4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.","Croll, Leah; Kurzweil, Arielle; Hasanaj, Lisena; Serrano, Liliana; Balcer, Laura J; Galetta, Steven L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Neurol Sci;416: 117034, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: J Neurol Sci;416: 117034, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Lessons from dermatology about inflammatory responses in Covid-19","The SARS-Cov-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus composed of 16 non-structural proteins (NSP 1-16) with specific roles in the replication of coronaviruses. NSP3 has the property to block host innate immune response and to promote cytokine expression. NSP5 can inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and NSP16 prevents MAD5 recognition, depressing the innate immunity. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a 'cytokine storm'. These systemic conditions share polymorphous cutaneous lesions where innate immune system is involved in the histopathological findings with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hyperferritinemia, increased serum levels of D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, reactive-C-protein and serum A amyloid. It is described that several polymorphous cutaneous lesions similar to erythema pernio, urticarial rashes, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicles lesions, and purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema. This review describes the complexity of Covid-19, its pathophysiological and clinical aspects.","Criado, Paulo Ricardo; Pagliari, Carla; Carneiro, Francisca Regina Oliveira; Quaresma, Juarez Antonio Simões","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2130",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Med Virol;: e2130, 2020 Jul 12.; Publication details: Rev Med Virol;: e2130, 2020 Jul 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Is the mental health of young students and their family members affected during the quarantine period? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Albania","INTRODUCTION: The use of quarantine method has a significant impact on mental health status. AIM: This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members' during the quarantine period of COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used. Institutional e-mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. RESULTS: In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ-9 score was 6.220 (SD=5.803) and 6.280 (SD=5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID-19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members.

"Increased generalized anxiety, depression and distress during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study in Germany","BACKGROUND: Since the first cases of the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 were reported in December 2019 in China, the virus has spread in most countries. The aim of the present study was to assess initial data on the mental health burden of the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany and collected complete datasets from 15 704 German residents aged 18 years and over. Besides demographics, generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2) and psychological distress (DT) were assessed. Furthermore, COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were covered. RESULTS: Significantly increased symptoms were highly prevalent in all dimensions: generalized anxiety (44.9%), depression (14.3%), psychological distress (65.2%) and COVID-19-related fear (59%). Females and younger people reported higher mental burden. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 are negatively associated with mental health burden. However, the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 is positively associated with increased COVID-19-related fear. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of appropriate psychological interventions for those in need and the provision of transparency and comprehensible information are crucial during the current pandemic.","Bäuerle, Alexander; Teufel, Martin; Musche, Venja; Weismüller, Benjamin; Kohler, Hannah; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Dörrie, Nora; Schweda, Adam; Skoda, Eva-Maria","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa106",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Public Health (Oxf);2020 Jul 13.; Publication details: J Public Health (Oxf);2020 Jul 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Gaucher Disease patients in Spain: Time to reconsider home-based therapies?","OBJECTIVE: An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here. PATIENTS & METHODS: The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent. RESULTS: 110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were &#8805; 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients treated at hospitals reported dose interruptions. Home-based therapy may need to be considered in order to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Andrade-Campos, Marcio; Escuder-Azuara, Beatriz; de Frutos, Laura López; Serrano-Gonzalo, Irene; Giraldo, Pilar","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcmd.2020.102478",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Blood Cells Mol Dis;85: 102478, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication details: Blood Cells Mol Dis;85: 102478, 2020 Jul 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"When altruists cannot help: the influence of altruism on the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The positive predictive effect of altruism on physical and psychological well-being has been extensively demonstrated in previous studies, but few studies have examined the effect of altruism on negative mental health outcomes when altruists cannot perform altruistic behaviours. This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. METHOD: University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. RESULTS: The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mage = 19.76 ± 2.23 years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (ß = 0.16, p < .001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (ß = 0.134, p < .001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (t = 7.68, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings enrich theories of altruism and provide valuable insight into the influence of altruism on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Feng, Yi; Zong, Min; Yang, Zhizun; Gu, Wen; Dong, Dan; Qiao, Zhihong","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00587-y",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 61, 2020 07 10.; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 61, 2020 07 10.; Affect; Altruism; Anxiety/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Depression/epidemiology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Students/psychology; Adolescent; China/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Self Report; Students/statistics & numerical data; Universities; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Understanding the Perceived Mental Health of Canadians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: While the physical health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are regularly publicly available, the mental health toll on Canadians is unknown. This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. DATA: The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. METHODS: Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. RESULTS: Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health. DISCUSSION: These findings point to particular risks for lower perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight various concerns of Canadians which may be associated with mental health, in particular, family stress in the home.","Findlay, Leanne C; Arim, Rubab; Kohen, Dafna","https://dx.doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000400003-eng",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Health Rep;31(4): 22-27, 2020 06 24.; Publication details: Health Rep;31(4): 22-27, 2020 06 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Psychological Impact of Epidemic and Pandemic Outbreaks on Healthcare Workers: Rapid Review of the Evidence","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: We aim to provide quantitative evidence on the psychological impact of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks (i.e., SARS, MERS, COVID-19, ebola, and influenza A) on healthcare workers (HCWs). RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3 years in 10-40%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.","Preti, Emanuele; Di Mattei, Valentina; Perego, Gaia; Ferrari, Federica; Mazzetti, Martina; Taranto, Paola; Di Pierro, Rossella; Madeddu, Fabio; Calati, Raffaella","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01166-z",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Psychiatry Rep;22(8): 43, 2020 07 10.; Publication details: Curr Psychiatry Rep;22(8): 43, 2020 07 10.; Anxiety/psychology; Depression/psychology; Health Personnel/psychology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Psychological Distress; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/psychology; Anxiety/etiology; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Depression/etiology; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola/epidemiology; Humans; Influenza, Human/epidemiology; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/etiology; Stress, Psychological/etiology; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). CONCLUSION: Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A; Alrashed, Saleh A; Alzunaydi, Ali A; Almohimeed, Ahmed S; Aljohani, Moath S","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152192",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Compr Psychiatry;102: 152192, 2020 Jul 12.; Publication details: Compr Psychiatry;102: 152192, 2020 Jul 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological health, sleep quality, and coping styles to stress facing the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To understand Wuhan residents' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 epidemic and offer a reference point for interventions, an online questionnaire survey was conducted. It included the Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), Athens Insomnia Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Categorical data were reported as numbers and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between demographic factors and anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style. A total of 1242 Wuhan residents investigated, 27.5% had anxiety, 29.3% had depression, 30.0% had a sleep disorder, and 29.8% had a passive response to COVID-19. Being female was the risk factor for anxiety (OR = 1.62) and sleep disorder (OR = 1.36); being married was associated with anxiety (OR = 1.75); having a monthly income between 1000 and 5000 CNY (OR = 1.44, OR = 1.83, OR = 2.61) or >5000 CNY (OR = 1.47, OR = 1.45, OR = 2.14) was a risk factor for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder; not exercising (OR = 1.45, OR = 1.71, OR = 1. 85, OR = 1.71) was a common risk factor for anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style; and having a higher education level (bachelor's degree and above) (OR = 1.40) was associated with having a sleep disorder. Wuhan residents' psychological status and sleep quality were relatively poorer than they were before the COVID-19 epidemic; however, the rate of passive coping to stress was relatively higher.","Fu, Wenning; Wang, Chao; Zou, Li; Guo, Yingying; Lu, Zuxun; Yan, Shijiao; Mao, Jing","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00913-3",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 225, 2020 07 09.; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 225, 2020 07 09.; Adaptation, Psychological; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Epidemics; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology; Stress, Psychological/etiology; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety/etiology; China/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/epidemiology; Depression/etiology; Epidemics/statistics & numerical data; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sleep Wake Disorders/epidemiology; Sleep Wake Disorders/psychology; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Stress, Psychological/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological and Ocular Surface State of Ophthalmologists and Ophthalmic Nurses Working With Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019","Importance: The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. Objective: To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Main Outcomes and Measures: Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Results: Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70â<U+0080>¯000) and 0.07% (21 of 30â<U+0080>¯000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70â<U+0080>¯000; 21 of 35â<U+0080>¯000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90 (2.30), 7.38 (2.19), 24.52 (5.86), and 43.90 (3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67 (3.04), 9.38 (2.64), 21.48 (6.15), and 40.05 (6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67 (2.89), 4.90 (3.15), 12.76 (7.27), and 38.79 (7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67 (3.20), 4.33 (3.23), 10.10 (7.62), and 41.52 (5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Yi; Zhang, Wei","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.2289",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Ophthalmol;2020 Jul 09.; Publication details: JAMA Ophthalmol;2020 Jul 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Compliance with Precautionary Measures: Age and Sex Matter","Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18-29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (p < 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (p < 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors. Furthermore, it has implications for policy makers demonstrating the need for effective mental health programs and guidance for the implementation of PM as a public health strategy.","Solomou, Ioulia; Constantinidou, Fofi","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144924",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 08.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(14)2020 07 08.; Anxiety/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Depression/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Universal Precautions/statistics & numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/prevention & control; Cyprus/epidemiology; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics/prevention & control; Patient Compliance; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention & control; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Physical health among people with serious mental illness in the face of COVID-19: Concerns and mitigation strategies","COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed ""non-urgent"" and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.","Melamed, Osnat C; Hahn, Margaret K; Agarwal, Sri Mahavir; Taylor, Valerie H; Mulsant, Benoit H; Selby, Peter","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.013",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Gen Hosp Psychiatry;66: 30-33, 2020 Jun 30.; Publication details: Gen Hosp Psychiatry;66: 30-33, 2020 Jun 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mentality and behavior in COVID-19 emergency status in Japan: Influence of personality, morality and ideology","The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 and severely influenced society. In response, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on 7th April in seven prefectures. The study conducted an immediate survey on 8th April to record the response of the general public to the first emergency status due to epidemics. The study hypothesized that personality traits, moral foundation, and political ideology can influence people's mentality, cognition, and behavior toward COVID-19. Based on a nationwide dataset of 1856 respondents (male = 56.3%, Mage = 46.7, emergency regions = 49.9%), the study found that personality, morality, and ideology altered mental health status and motivated behaviors toward COVID-19. Neuroticism and avoiding harm involved cognition and behavior through various means. The study also found significant differences among demographic groups.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice in India: Results of an Anonymized National Survey","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for medical professionals throughout the world to tackle the rapidly changing scenario. The objective of this survey was to analyze the change in neurosurgical practice in India following the COVID-19 outbreak and assess its impact on practising neurosurgeons. Materials and Methods: Between May 7th and 23rd, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated amongst practising neurosurgeons across the country by social media and e-mails, regarding changes in the patterns of patients seen, adaptations made in their practice, effect on surgeries performed, financial burden, and impact on their personal lives. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for correlations between the changes observed and independent factors such as hospital affiliations, teaching professions, and neurosurgical experience. Results: Our survey showed a drastic fall in the number of neurosurgical patients seen in the outpatient department (OPD) as well as the number of surgeries performed. A drop of 76.25% was seen in OPD patients (P = 0.000) and that of 70.59% in surgeries performed (P = 0.000). There was no uniformity among the neurosurgeons in the number of COVID-19 tests being done before elective/emergency surgery and in the use of protective gear while examining patients. Private practitioners were more affected financially as compared to those in the government sector. The pandemic has affected the research work of 53.23% of all respondents, with those in the teaching profession (70.96%) more affected than those in the non-teaching profession (24.67%). Conclusions: Evidence-based policies, screening COVID-19 tests with better sensitivity, and better-quality personal protective equipment kits in adequate numbers are required to protect our medical professionals from COVID-19. Mental health issues among neurosurgeons may also be an issue, this being a high risk speciality and should be closely watched for.","Venkataram, Tejas; Goyal, Nishant; Dash, Chinmaya; Chandra, Prarthana P; Chaturvedi, Jitender; Raheja, Amol; Singla, Raghav; Sardhara, Jayesh; Singh, Bhoopendra; Gupta, Ravi","https://dx.doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.289004",NA,"Country: IN; ÍNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neurol India;68(3): 595-602, 2020.; Publication details: Neurol India;68(3): 595-602, 2020.; Ambulatory Care/statistics & numerical data; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Elective Surgical Procedures/statistics & numerical data; Neurosurgery/statistics & numerical data; Neurosurgical Procedures/statistics & numerical data; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data; Telemedicine/statistics & numerical data; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections/diagnosis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; India/epidemiology; Male; Mass Screening; Neurosurgeons/economics; Neurosurgeons/psychology; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment/supply & distribution; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on socioeconomic and mental health aspects in Nepal","BACKGROUND: Public health concern is increasing with recent rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Nepal. To curb this pandemic, Nepal is facing some forms of lockdown, encouraging people to implement social distancing so as to reduce interactions between people which could eventually reduce the possibilities of new infection; however, it has affected the overall physical, mental, social and spiritual health of the people. METHODS: Published articles related to psychosocial effects due to COVID-19 and other outbreaks were searched and reviewed. CONCLUSION: While many countries are supporting their citizens with sophisticated health safety-nets and various relief funds, some developing countries have unique challenges with vulnerable populations and limited resources to respond to the pandemic.

"Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on sleep quality in university students and administration staff","INTRODUCTION: In Italy, lockdown due to COVID-19 health emergency started on March 10 and partially ended on May 3rd, 2020. There was a significant increase of psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness, and worsening of quality of sleep in the general population. METHODS: Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84 ± 2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02 ± 12.46). RESULTS: we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students. In workers, we observed a prevalence of maintenance insomnia before COVID-19 of 24% that significantly increase during COVID-19 reaching 40%, while workers with difficulties in sleep initiation were only 15% that increased to 42%. In our sample, 27.8% showed depressive symptoms, while 34.3% showed anxious symptoms, in particular in students. CONCLUSION: The impact of lockdown was greater in students than in workers, and in females than in males. Concerning the psycho-emotional aspects, about one-third of our sample showed depressive or anxious symptoms.

"How do Funeral Practices impact Bereaved Relatives' Mental Health, Grief and Bereavement? A Mixed Methods Review with Implications for COVID-19","Those who are bereaved during the current COVID-19 pandemic are subject to restrictions on funeral sizes and practices. We conducted a rapid review synthesising the quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, KSR Evidence, and COVID-related resources were conducted. 805 records were screened; 17 studies of variable quality were included. Current evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes is inconclusive. Five observational studies found benefits from funeral participation while six did not. However, qualitative research provides additional insight: the benefit of after-death rituals including funerals depends on the ability of the bereaved to shape those rituals and say goodbye in a way which is meaningful for them. Findings highlight the important role of funeral officiants during the pandemic. Research is needed to better understand the experiences and sequalae of grief and bereavement during COVID-19.","Burrell, Alexander; Selman, Lucy E","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0030222820941296",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Omega (Westport);: 30222820941296, 2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Omega (Westport);: 30222820941296, 2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Hospital suicide due to non-treatment by healthcare staff fearing COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh?","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to individuals fearing COVID-19 infection alongside conditions such anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress. For a small minority, such mental health factors can contribute to suicide. Here we report a novel reason for suicide and seemingly COVID-19-related - negligence in getting treatment by Bangladeshi healthcare providers. It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested.","Mamun, Mohammed A; Bodrud-Doza, Md; Griffiths, Mark D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102295",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Asian J Psychiatr;54: 102295, 2020 Jul 11.; Publication details: Asian J Psychiatr;54: 102295, 2020 Jul 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Emergency medicine physician burnout and wellness in Canada before COVID19: A national survey","INTRODUCTION: Emergency medicine (EM) is a high-risk specialty for burnout. COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. RESULTS: A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. CONCLUSION: Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty. This important baseline information can be used to monitor the physical and mental risks to EM physicians during and after COVID-19, and evaluate support for mental health and wellness, which is urgently needed now and post pandemic.","Lim, Rodrick; Aarsen, Kristine Van; Gray, Sara; Rang, Louise; Fitzpatrick, Jada; Fischer, Lisa","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/cem.2020.431",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: CJEM;: 1-5, 2020 Jun 24.; Publication details: CJEM;: 1-5, 2020 Jun 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Economic, Mental Health, HIV Prevention and HIV Treatment Impacts of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 Response on a Global Sample of Cisgender Gay Men and Other Men Who Have Sex with Men","There is an urgent need to measure the impacts of COVID-19 among gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM). We conducted a cross-sectional survey with a global sample of gay men and other MSM (n = 2732) from April 16, 2020 to May 4, 2020, through a social networking app. We characterized the economic, mental health, HIV prevention and HIV treatment impacts of COVID-19 and the COVID-19 response, and examined whether sub-groups of our study population are disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Many gay men and other MSM not only reported economic and mental health consequences, but also interruptions to HIV prevention and testing, and HIV care and treatment services. These consequences were significantly greater among people living with HIV, racial/ethnic minorities, immigrants, sex workers, and socio-economically disadvantaged groups. These findings highlight the urgent need to mitigate the negative impacts of COVID-19 among gay men and other MSM.","Santos, Glenn-Milo; Ackerman, Benjamin; Rao, Amrita; Wallach, Sara; Ayala, George; Lamontage, Erik; Garner, Alex; Holloway, Ian W; Arreola, Sonya; Silenzio, Vince; Strömdahl, Susanne; Yu, Louis; Strong, Carol; Adamson, Tyler; Yakusik, Anna; Doan, Tran Thu; Huang, Poyao; Cerasuolo, Damiano; Bishop, Amie; Noori, Teymur; Pharris, Anastasia; Aung, Max; Dara, Masoud; Chung, Ssu Yu; Hanley, Marguerite; Baral, Stefan; Beyrer, Chris; Howell, Sean","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-02969-0",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: AIDS Behav;2020 Jul 11.; Publication details: AIDS Behav;2020 Jul 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Differences in Sense of Belonging, Pride, and Mental Health in the Daegu Metropolitan Region due to COVID-19: Comparison between the Presence and Absence of National Disaster Relief Fund","Korea's Daegu Metropolitan City once had the second highest rate of COVID-19 infection after Wuhan in China. Following the outbreak, the government provided the first national disaster relief fund to citizens as financial aid. This study investigated whether the sense of regional belonging, pride, and mental health among 550 citizens of Daegu differed between the times before and after COVID-19, based on the presence or absence of the disaster relief fund. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and t-tests were conducted using the SPSS 25.0 program. Results showed that the sense of belonging was higher after COVID-19 than before, while pride was lower. Individuals who received the disaster relief fund showed higher levels of regional belonging and pride with statistical significance. The prevalence of melancholy and depression increased after COVID-19, but the presence or absence of the fund did not lead to a significant difference. Thus, in case of a future national disaster level, provision of the disaster relief fund can raise the sense of regional belonging and pride, in order to elicit communication among local residents toward overcoming difficulties. Furthermore, during challenging disaster situations, central and local governments should provide diverse programs for the citizens' mental health care.","Kim, Young-Jae; Cho, Jeong-Hyung; Kim, E-Sack","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134910",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 07.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 07.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Disasters/economics; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Sociological Factors; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections/economics; Emotions; Female; Financial Management; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics/economics; Pneumonia, Viral/economics; Republic of Korea; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Debate: #Together despite the distance","The pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a major global impact on the healthcare systems worldwide as they deal with the surge of critically ill persons. Additionally, the preventative measure of stay-at-home orders and closure of nonessential businesses has caused the disruption of entire communities. The child/youth mental health workforce bears the additional burden of the disruption of the systems-based practice crucial to the successful provision of mental health services. Major sources of stress for the workforce include: (a) a threat to the worker's personal/family health and life (traumatic injury), (b) a loss of colleagues or threat to professional mastery and identity (grief injury), (c) an inner conflict between ones' values and aspirations and what they are able to accomplish in their work (moral injury), and (d) fatigue, simply feeling worn out by the relentless work and need, without time for rest and recovery (fatigue injury). The rapid transformation of the in-person to virtual practice by the implementation of telehealth/telephonic sessions has eroded the boundary between personal/professional life and created a new Zoom fatigue.","Chrisman, Allan K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/camh.12406",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Jul 12.; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Jul 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 pandemic and psychological fatigue in Turkey","AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological fatigue as a mental health issue among the population of Istanbul, Turkey. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (p < .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (p < .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (p = .008) and isolation (p = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that level of education, avoiding going to crowded places, eye, nose and mouth organs are sensitive organs to the virus, keeping physical distance due to epidemic affect by COVID-19 virus, isolation and treatment of people reduce the spread of COVID-19 virus and 14-days period of time, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected person, occupational status, health education programme needed and antibody treatment variables were significantly associated with fatigue after adjusting for age, gender and income variables.

"Changes in Weight and Nutritional Habits in Adults with Obesity during the ""Lockdown"" Period Caused by the COVID-19 Virus Emergency","Our aim is evaluating the changes in weight and dietary habits in a sample of outpatients with obesity after 1 month of enforced lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. In this observational retrospective study, the patients of our Obesity Unit were invited to answer to a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire relative to weight changes, working activity, exercise, dietary habits, and conditions potentially impacting on nutritional choices. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations among weight/BMI changes and the analyzed variables. A total of 150 subjects (91.5%) completed the questionnaire. Mean self-reported weight gain was &#8776;1.5 kg (p < 0.001). Lower exercise, self-reported boredom/solitude, anxiety/depression, enhanced eating, consumption of snacks, unhealthy foods, cereals, and sweets were correlated with a significantly higher weight gain. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased education (inversely, ß = -1.15; 95%CI -2.13, -0.17, p = 0.022), self-reported anxiety/depression (ß = 1.61; 0.53, 2.69, p = 0.004), and not consuming healthy foods (ß = 1.48; 0.19, 2.77, p = 0.026) were significantly associated with increased weight gain. The estimated direct effect of self-reported anxiety/depression on weight was 2.07 kg (1.07, 3.07, p < 0.001). Individuals with obesity significantly gained weight 1 month after the beginning of the quarantine.

"Association between social support and anxiety among pregnant women in the third trimester during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Qingdao, China: The mediating effect of risk perception","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a threat to the mental health of pregnant women. AIM: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support and anxiety, and the mediating effect of risk perception during the COVID-19 epidemic in the third trimester pregnant women in Qingdao, China. METHODS: From 16 to 21 February 2020, an online survey was conducted, which collected the information on demographic data, anxiety, social support and risk perception to COVID-19 of women with established medical records in the ambulatory of the Department of Obstetrics at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Anxiety was assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), social support was assessed by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and risk perception was assessed by a self-designed questionnaire. RESULTS: This study had 308 participants with an average of 31.02 ± 3.91 years. During the period of prevention and control of the epidemic, most pregnant women adopted protective measures, such as wearing masks (97.4%), washing hands frequently (88.3%) and staying at home (76.3%). The average SAS, SSRS and risk perception scores of the participants were 42.45 ± 6.98, 44.60 ± 7.00 and 21.60 ± 5.74, respectively. The total effect of maternal social support on anxiety was -2.63 (95% confidence interval (CI): -4.40 ~ -1.44, p < .001), the direct effect was -1.44 (95% CI: -2.74 ~ -0.35, p < .05) and the indirect effect was -1.19 (95% CI: -2.49 ~ -0.51, p < .001). CONCLUSION: The third trimester pregnant women had a high level of social support, a medium level of risk perception to COVID-19 and were susceptible to anxiety. Risk perception played a mediating role between social support and anxiety.","Yue, Chongyu; Liu, Cuiping; Wang, Jing; Zhang, Meng; Wu, Hongjing; Li, Chunrong; Yang, Xiuling","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020941567",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020941567, 2020 Jul 09.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020941567, 2020 Jul 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Anxiety and Depression of Nurses in a North West Province in China During the Period of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Outbreak","PURPOSE: To investigate the anxiety and depression levels of frontline clinical nurses working in 14 hospitals in Gansu Province, China, during this period. DESIGN: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online between February 7 and 10, 2020, with a convenience sample of 22,034 nurses working in 14 prefecture and city hospitals in Gansu Province, located in northwest China. METHODS: A self-reported questionnaire with four parts (demographic characteristics, general questions related to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, self-rating anxiety scale, and self-rating depression scale) was administered. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and SDs were computed. The associations between anxiety and depression with sociodemographic characteristics, work-related concerns, and impacts were analyzed, followed by multivariable logistic regression to identify factors that best predicted the nurses' anxiety and depression levels. FINDINGS: A total of 21,199 questionnaires were checked to be valid, with an effective recovery rate of 96.21%. The mean ± SD age of the respondents was 31.89 ± 7.084 years, and the mean ± SD length of service was 9.40 ± 7.638 years. The majority of the respondents were female (98.6%) and married (73.1%). Some demographic characteristics, related concerns, and impacts of COVID-19 were found to be significantly associated with both anxiety (p < .001) and depression (p < .001). Nurses who needed to take care of children or elderly relatives, took leave from work because they were worried about COVID-19, avoided contact with family and friends, and wanted to obtain more COVID-19-related knowledge had higher levels of both anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that nurses faced with the COVID-19 outbreak are at risk for experiencing anxiety and depression. Demographic background, psychosocial factors, and work-related factors predicted the psychological responses. The family responsibilities and burdens of women may explain the higher levels of anxiety and depression among nurses with these obligations as compared to those without. On the other hand, nurses who chose not to take leave from work or who did not avoid going to work during this period were less anxious and depressed. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Professional commitment might be a protective factor for adverse psychological responses. It is pertinent to provide emotional support for nurses and recognize their professional commitment in providing service to people in need.","Han, Lin; Wong, Frances Kam Yuet; She, Dong Li M; Li, Si Yan; Yang, Yun Fang; Jiang, Meng Yao; Ruan, Yue; Su, Qian; Ma, Yuxia; Chung, Loretta Yuet Foon","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12590",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Nurs Scholarsh;2020 Jul 11.; Publication details: J Nurs Scholarsh;2020 Jul 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Another invisible enemy indoors: COVID-19, human health, the home, and United States indoor air policy","After the emergence of the respiratory virus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), many exposure and environmental health scientists promptly recognized the potentially catastrophic public health ramifications of concurrent infectious and air pollution-mediated disease. Nevertheless, much of this attention has been focused on outdoor interactions. Each year, 3.8 million people worldwide prematurely die from illnesses attributable to indoor air. Hence, poor household indoor air quality is a long-standing public health issue with even greater relevance now that many individuals are spending more time at home. At present, the Environmental Protection Agency does not regulate indoor air, and state-level legislation has resulted in a patchwork of national coverage. Here, we describe common sources of indoor air pollution, the health impacts of indoor pollutants, and populations disparately impacted by COVID-19 and poor indoor air quality.

"Prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 in a Los Angeles Health System","With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with phased reopening, it is critical to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility and severity of disease in a diverse population to help shape government policies, guide clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research  In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation)  Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3 7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient)  Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission  Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities  Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility  Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5 2 [3 2-8 3], p=2 6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2 1 [1 6-2 8], p=1 1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1 8 [1 4-2 2], p=5 7 x 10-6)  Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission  Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9 7 [2 8-39], p=3 2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6 0 [2 3, 16], p=2 7x10-4)  Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0 61 [0 45, 0 81], p=4 3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4 5 [2 3, 8 9], p=1 8x10-5)  We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome  This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission  Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research","Chang, Timothy S.; Ding, Yi; Freund, Malika K.; Johnson, Ruth; Schwarz, Tommer; Yabu, Julie M.; Hazlett, Chad; Chiang, Jeffrey N.; Wulf, Ami; Geschwind, Daniel H.; Butte, Manish J.; Pasaniuc, Bogdan","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145581",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Threatening increase in alcohol consumption in physicians quarantined due to coronavirus outbreak in Poland: the ALCOVID survey","BACKGROUND: The potential risks of increased alcohol use and of the development of alcohol dependence during COVID-19 pandemic were identified. So far there have been no studies concerning pandemic influence on alcohol consumption in medical professionals in quarantine or isolation. METHODS: The 12 point 'online' ALCOVID survey with a cover letter was designed and addressed to physicians, recruited online via accessible networks, who underwent isolation or quarantine during recent pandemic. The AUDIT-3 scale was included. RESULTS: A representative trial of 113 physicians participated in the study. Over 53% of screened doctors revealed that the amounts of the consumed alcohol have escalated; almost 20% of subjects binged over seven standard drinks for one occasion. Close to every second used six or more drinks on one occasion. Over 40% used alcohol more than four times per week. Female used alcohol more often and more standard drinks per occasion. Male binged more. Anxiety and hopelessness were the most common motives to drink. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol consumption in physicians in quarantine has threateningly increased. It is important to identify the group of people at the risk of problem drinking and dependence development, especially when it concerns key professional branches in the fight against the current crisis.","Silczuk, Andrzej","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa110",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Public Health (Oxf);2020 Jul 09.; Publication details: J Public Health (Oxf);2020 Jul 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Survey on Knowledge and Psychological Crisis Related to COVID-19 among Nursing Staff: A Cross-sectional Study","BACKGROUND: Background: Since December 2019, the prevalence of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in the world. Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of infection by coronavirus. Therefore, there is a urging need to assess their mental health condition and set up appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and psychological crisis related to COVID-19 among nursing staff, and to provide evidence for targeted training and psychological intervention. METHODS: This cross-sectional online survey study was performed in a class three grade A general hospital from a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire of COVID-19 related prevention and control knowledge and the Triages Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological crisis. SPSS 23.0 was applied to compute the collected data. RESULTS: A total of 979 nursing staff completed the questionnaire. The results showed that nursing staff have lower number of correct answers of continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (38.7%), debarment criteria (55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (72.8%). The overall score of the TAF was 7.0 (5.0-12.0), and there were statistical significance in scores between different types of personnel, years of work experience and department (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, despite the psychological damage of nursing staff is slight, nurse manager must continue to monitor their mental health and take timely interventions.","Huang, Hua-Ping; Zhao, Wen-Jun; Li, Gui-Rong","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20606",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths in China. Prior research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (Mage = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the ""perceived severity of COVID-19-mental health problems"" association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Jian-Bin; Yang, An; Dou, Kai; Cheung, Rebecca Y M","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134820",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 04.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 04.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Mental Health; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Self-Control/psychology; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; China/epidemiology; Coronavirus; Disease Outbreaks; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Secondary Traumatization Outcomes and Associated Factors Among the Health Care Workers Exposed to the COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Secondary traumatization exposure and mental health conditions of health care workers gained importance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic period. AIMS: In our study, we aim to research the secondary traumatization and associated factors among health care workers. METHOD: This cross-sectional study was applied through an online questionnaire using the snowball sampling method. Two hundred fifty-one health care workers from different units/services and 312 non-medical worker adults attended to the research. Health care workers were divided into two groups based on working with COVID-19 patients at the frontline or not. The data were collected via Introductory Information Form, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) between 22 May and 30 May 2020. RESULTS: Among the 563 participants, 251 (44.6%) were health care workers and 312 (55.4%) were non-medical workers. The anxiety, depression and secondary traumatization scores of the frontline health care workers for the COVID-19 were found to be significantly higher than those of the other health workers or non-medical workers (p < .001). Also, we found that being a woman, being in the first years of the work, living with a parent, having a chronic disease, having a trauma history and increased social media use are related to having higher scores from the secondary traumatization scale. CONCLUSION: The secondary traumatization exposure and the mental health conditions of the health care workers directly working with the COVID-19 patients should be taken into consideration. It is important to provide social support, examine and control riskier groups for mental health regularly during the pandemic.","Arpacioglu, Selim; Gurler, Meltem; Cakiroglu, Suleyman","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940742",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020940742, 2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020940742, 2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Provision of Psychotherapy during the COVID-19 Pandemic among Czech, German and Slovak Psychotherapists","Psychotherapists around the world are facing an unprecedented situation with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To combat the rapid spread of the virus, direct contact with others has to be avoided when possible. Therefore, remote psychotherapy provides a valuable option to continue mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study investigated the fear of psychotherapists to become infected with COVID-19 during psychotherapy in personal contact and assessed how the provision of psychotherapy changed due to the COVID-19 situation and whether there were differences with regard to country and gender. Psychotherapists from three European countries: Czech Republic (CZ, n = 112), Germany (DE, n = 130) and Slovakia (SK, n = 96), with on average 77.8% female participants, completed an online survey. Participants rated the fear of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face psychotherapy and reported the number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via internet) during the COVID-19 situation as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. Fear of COVID-19 infection was highest in SK and lowest in DE (p < 0.001) and was higher in female compared to male psychotherapists (p = 0.021). In all countries, the number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (p < 0.001) and remote psychotherapies increased (p < 0.001), with more patients being treated via internet than via telephone during the COVID-19 situation (p < 0.001). Furthermore, female psychotherapists treated less patients in personal contact (p = 0.036), while they treated more patients via telephone than their male colleagues (p = 0.015). Overall, the total number of patients treated did not differ during COVID-19 from the months before (p = 0.133) and psychotherapy in personal contact remained the most common treatment modality. Results imply that the supply of mental health care could be maintained during COVID-19 and that changes in the provision of psychotherapy vary among countries and gender.","Humer, Elke; Pieh, Christoph; Kuska, Martin; Barke, Antonia; Doering, Bettina K; Gossmann, Katharina; Trnka, Radek; Meier, Zdenek; Kascakova, Natalia; Tavel, Peter; Probst, Thomas","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134811",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 04.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 04.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Psychotherapy/statistics & numerical data; Telemedicine/statistics & numerical data; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Czech Republic; Fear; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Psychotherapy/methods; Slovakia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The mental health of health care workers in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 disease is one of the most destructive events that humanity has witnessed in the 21st century. It has impacted all aspects of life and all segments of populations, including already vulnerable health care providers. AIMS: This study sought to detect the prevalence of mental health issues in sample of physicians and nurses working in several health facilities in Oman. METHOD: We gauged the mental health conditions of 509 physicians (38.1%) and nurses (61.9 %) using the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and World Health Organization Well-Being Index. RESULTS: The study revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety and poor psychological well-being, especially among females, young health care workers and those who interacted with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of this study support the handful of studies published during this global health crisis that have found that the mental health of health care workers has been harshly affected and predicted that it will continue, to various degrees, to be affected in the foreseeable future. The results of this study highlight the urgency of providing administrative and psychological support as well as current and accurate information on COVID-19 to health care workers.","Badahdah, Abdallah; Khamis, Faryal; Al Mahyijari, Nawal; Al Balushi, Marwa; Al Hatmi, Hashil; Al Salmi, Issa; Albulushi, Zakariya; Al Noomani, Jaleela","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020939596",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020939596, 2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020939596, 2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Implementation of Home-Based Telemental Health in a Large Child Psychiatry Department During the COVID-19 Crisis","Objective: Telemental health (TMH) is not well described for mental health service delivery during crises. Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. Results: The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges. Our experience provides a roadmap for establishing a HB-TMH service with focus on rapid implementation. It also demonstrates a role for TMH during (rather than after) future crises when usual community resources are not available.","Sharma, Aditi; Sasser, Tyler; Schoenfelder Gonzalez, Erin; Vander Stoep, Ann; Myers, Kathleen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cap.2020.0062",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: J Child Adolesc Psychopharmacol;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. In-vitro data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence of clinical efficacy. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 umol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration >150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality in chloroquine self-poisoning. Pharmacokinetic modelling predicts that most high dose regimens trialled in COVID-19 are unlikely to cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.","Watson, James A; Tarning, Joel; Hoglund, Richard M; Baud, Frederic J; Megarbane, Bruno; Clemessy, Jean-Luc; White, Nicholas J","https://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58631",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Elife;92020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Elife;92020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Challenges and recommendations for mental health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the experience of China's First University-based mental health team","Coronavirus Disease is impacting the entire world. As the first country that has needed to confront this disease, China has responded with unprecedented and hugely successful public health initiatives. Almost simultaneous with the awareness of the potential for widespread loss of life, the first Chinese university recognizing the likely psychological impacts of COVID-19, assembled the first university-based professional team to offer pandemic-related mental health services to the Chinese public. This paper describes the work that we provided and the challenges encountered. The challenges are described in four contexts: the organizational/systemic level, the technical perspective, the therapeutic process, and the ethical aspects. We also provide recommendations on what we can do in the short term, and future improvements that can be made.","Chen, Shitao; Li, Feihan; Lin, Chaihua; Han, Yuge; Nie, Xilun; Portnoy, Robert N; Qiao, Zhihong","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00591-2",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 59, 2020 07 09.; Publication details: Global Health;16(1): 59, 2020 07 09.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Mental Health Services/organization & administration; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; China/epidemiology; Health Services Research; Humans; Universities; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of COVID-19: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","ABSTRACT Background Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the COVID-19  With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs’ neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications  Methods Literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950-2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine  Review First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels  Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents  Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible, and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of “psychosis following chloroquine ” Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports  It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications, however, overdose on these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality  Conclusion The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for COVID-19 treatment is not known  Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine  However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for COVID-19, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Hamm, Brandon S.; Rosenthal, Lisa J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020.; Publication details: Psychosomatics;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"“I feel like death on legs”: COVID-19 isolation and mental health","This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies  Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic  None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements  This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse  Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories  The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war  In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on  Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies  I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month  The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015)  The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others  The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19","Herat, Manel","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Social Sciences & Humanities Open;2020.; Publication details: Social Sciences & Humanities Open;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

(Infektionsschutzgesetz)?overriding other elements of the legal order  They also limited the government?s use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government?s crisis measures  Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition?namely public willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health?that is absent in the German case","Michael Dostal, Jörg","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-923X.12865",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: The Political Quarterly;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication details: The Political Quarterly;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from patients, caregivers and potential living donors-a qualitative study","BACKGROUND: Many countries have suspended kidney transplantation programs during the COVID-19 pandemic because of concerns for patient safety and the shortage of healthcare resources. This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs due to COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (n=22), caregivers (n=4) and potential donors (n=5). Transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from healthcare, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). CONCLUSIONS: During the suspension of kidney transplantation programs, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programs.","Guha, Chandana; Tong, Allison; Baumgart, Amanda; Scholes-Robertson, Nicole; Isbel, Nicole; Kanellis, John; Campbell, Scott; Coates, Toby; Chadban, Steven","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/tri.13697",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transpl Int;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Transpl Int;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Risk, resilience, psychological distress, and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic comes with multiple psychological stressors due to health-related, social, economic, and individual consequences and may cause psychological distress. The aim of this study was to screen the population in Germany for negative impact on mental health in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. METHODS: A total of 6,509 people took part in an online survey in Germany from 27 March to 6 April. The questionnaire included demographic information and ascertained psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk and protective factors. RESULTS: In our sample, over 50% expressed suffering from anxiety and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID-19 (M = 4.45). Psychological and social determinants showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID-19 than experiences with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The current COVID-19 pandemic does cause psychological distress, anxiety, and depression for large proportions of the general population. Strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, acceptance of anxiety and negative emotions, fostering self-efficacy, and information on where to get medical treatment if needed, seem of help, while substance abuse and suppression of anxiety and negative emotions seem to be associated with more psychological burden.","Petzold, Moritz Bruno; Bendau, Antonia; Plag, Jens; Pyrkosch, Lena; Mascarell Maricic, Lea; Betzler, Felix; Rogoll, Janina; Große, Julia; Ströhle, Andreas","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1745",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Brain Behav;: e01745, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: Brain Behav;: e01745, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Pediatric mental and behavioral health in the period of quarantine and social distancing (COVID-19)","UNSTRUCTURED: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and has generated a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and also caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Pediatrics are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause pediatrics to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity and exhaustion, and even raising the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for pediatrics and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the bio-psycho-social model, some pediatrics may have catastrophic thoughts and are prone to experience despair, numbness, flashback and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or post-traumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for pediatric populations. Based on the psychological development characteristics of pediatrics, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on pediatrics. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on pediatrics. Healthcare delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and pediatric health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term become a new reality. Future research on pediatric mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, health informatics and among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to pediatrics' growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for pediatric health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor pediatrics' mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligences could be utilized to support decision-making on whether pediatrics should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened, etc. Implications to clinical practice, psychological therapeutic practices and future research directions to address current efforts gaps have been highlighted.","Ye, Jiancheng","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19867",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Pediatr Parent;2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: JMIR Pediatr Parent;2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A nation-wide survey on emotional and psychological impacts of COVID-19 social distancing","OBJECTIVE: Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. RESULTS: The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. CONCLUSIONS: The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, L; Ciancimino, G; Crescimbene, M; La Longa, F; Parsi, M R; Tintori, A; Palomba, R","https://dx.doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202006_21711",NA,"Country: IT; ITÁLIA; ITALY; ITALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci;24(12): 7155-7163, 2020 06.; Publication details: Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci;24(12): 7155-7163, 2020 06.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Emotions; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Social Behavior; Social Isolation/psychology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/prevention & control; Female; Humans; Internet; Italy; Male; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention & control; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Tisler, Anna","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Med Hypotheses;143: 110069, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: Med Hypotheses;143: 110069, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health During the Covid-19 Outbreak in China: a Meta-Analysis","BACKGROUND: Covid-19 has started to spread within China since the end of December 2019. Despite government's immediate actions and strict control, more and more people were infected every day. As such a contagious virus can spread easily and rapidly between people, the whole country was put into lockdown and people were forced into isolation. In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. RESULTS: A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data. The results showed that the incidence of anxiety was 25% (95% CI: 0.19-0.32), and the incidence of depression was 28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.38). Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these incidence estimates. Subgroup analysis included the study population and assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the significant heterogeneity detected in studies regarding this pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, we must interpret the results with caution. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system, which integrating epidemiological monitoring, screening and psychological crisis prevention and interventions.","Ren, Xin; Huang, Wanli; Pan, Huiping; Huang, Tingting; Wang, Xinwei; Ma, Yongchun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09796-5",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatr Q;2020 Jul 08.; Publication details: Psychiatr Q;2020 Jul 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of COVID-19 on gaming disorder: Monitoring and prevention","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has necessitated physical distancing, lockdown, contact tracing, and self-quarantine so as to prevent the spread of the disease. Amid the outbreak, gaming data usage has reportedly increased in the United States, and game download volume has reached a record high in Europe. Because gaming can be used to cope with the psychological stress from the outbreak, therefore mental health professionals should be aware of how increased gaming during the pandemic may contribute to risk of gaming disorder, especially if the pandemic persists. Mental health professionals should thus formulate safe social interaction alternatives for people, particularly adolescents, who have gaming disorder risk.","Ko, Chih-Hung; Yen, Ju-Yu","https://dx.doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00040",NA,"Country: HU; HUNGRIA; HUNGARY; HUNGRIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Behav Addict;2020 Jul 02.; Publication details: J Behav Addict;2020 Jul 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How to Defend COVID-19 in Taiwan? Talk about People's Disease Awareness, Attitudes, Behaviors and the Impact of Physical and Mental Health","This study explored awareness, attitudes, and behavior in relation to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention among Taiwanese citizens and their physical and mental health statuses. Through collection of 2132 questionnaire responses in field research, the present researchers analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and various approaches. In conclusion, the public's high level of willingness to share information, sufficient knowledge of and consensus on epidemic prevention between individuals and families, strict compliance with relevant regulations, effective preventive measures, and adequate public facilities have contributed to control of COVID-19. However, vigilance and awareness of the pandemic in some individuals, epidemic-prevention campaigns, and community-based preventive measures were insufficient. Some citizens subsequently suffered from headaches, anxiety, and mood instability. Furthermore, demographic variables (place of residence, sex, age, and occupation) and physical and mental health status produced various effects on citizens' awareness, attitude, and behavior regarding epidemic prevention as well as the perceived effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health.","Hsu, Chin-Hsien; Lin, Hsiao-Hsien; Wang, Chun-Chih; Jhang, Shangwun","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134694",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 06 30.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 06 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The experience of women infected by the COVID-19 during pregnancy in Brazil: a qualitative study protocol","BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly infectious, with the recent World Health Organization decree confirming a global public health emergency. The outcomes related to maternal and fetal health among pregnant women infected with the virus are still poorly understood. The world population has been waiting for answers and remains constantly alert about the pandemic's progress. It is not yet known what impact this pandemic experience will have on the population's mental health, especially pregnant women. METHOD: We aim to understand and discuss the experiences of women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, in relation to the illness process, community relations, and social media influences. This is a qualitative study in which we will interview women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy and received medical care from a tertiary university hospital specializing in women's health in Brazil. We will use the techniques of Semi-Directed Interviews of Open and In-depth Questions, socio-demographic and health data sheets, and Field Diaries. We will use purposive sampling and the criterion of theoretical saturation for its construction. The interviews will be conducted by phone or video call, with audio recorded for later transcription. The treatment of the data will be completed through Thematic Analysis and discussed in light of the Health Psychology framework, with the production of categories that answer the proposed research questions. DISCUSSION: It is expected that the results contribute to the understanding about the demands that come to the health professional of women infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy in a pandemic situation. INTRODUçãO: A doença causada pelo coronavírus (COVID-19) é altamente infecciosa, com a recente declaração da Organização Mundial de Saúde confirmando emergência global de saúde pública.

"Effects of Covid-19 Lockdown on Mental Health and Sleep Disturbances in Italy","Italy was the first European country that entered a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet.","Gualano, Maria Rosaria; Lo Moro, Giuseppina; Voglino, Gianluca; Bert, Fabrizio; Siliquini, Roberta","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134779",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 02.; Publication details: Int J Environ Res Public Health;17(13)2020 07 02.; Anxiety/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Depression/epidemiology; Mental Health; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders/epidemiology; Adult; Anxiety Disorders/epidemiology; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections/prevention & control; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Italy/epidemiology; Male; Pandemics/prevention & control; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention & control; Prevalence; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Do pre-existing anxiety-related and mood disorders differentially impact COVID-19 stress responses and coping?","BACKGROUND: People with pre-existing mental health conditions may be more susceptible to stressors associated with COVID-19 relative to the general population; however, no studies have assessed whether susceptibility differs between classes of mental health disorders. We assessed COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stressors, and coping in those with a primary anxiety-related disorder diagnosis, a primary mood disorder diagnosis, and no mental health disorder. METHODS: Adults from a population-representative sample from the United States and Canada who reported current (past year) anxiety-related (n = 700) or mood (n = 368) disorders were compared to a random sample of respondents who did not report a current mental health diagnosis (n = 500) on COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stress, and coping. RESULTS: The anxiety-related disorders group exhibited higher COVID Stress Scales total scores and higher scores on its fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms scales than the other groups. The mood disorders group had higher scores on the traumatic stress symptoms and socioeconomic consequences scales than those with no current mental disorder. Those with current anxiety-related or mood disorders were more likely to voluntarily self-isolate and were more likely to report greater self-isolation stressors and distress than those without a mental health disorder. Yet, there were no major differences in perceived effectiveness of coping strategies across groups. CONCLUSION: People with anxiety-related or mood disorders were more negatively affected by COVID-19 compared to those with no mental health disorder; however, adding to psychological burden, those with anxiety-related disorders reported greater fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms than the other groups. These findings suggest the need for tailoring COVID-19-related mental health interventions to meet the specific needs of people with pre-existing mental health conditions.","Asmundson, Gordon J G; Paluszek, Michelle M; Landry, Caeleigh A; Rachor, Geoffrey S; McKay, Dean; Taylor, Steven","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102271",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Anxiety Disord;74: 102271, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: J Anxiety Disord;74: 102271, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Challenges in the Practice of Sexual Medicine in the Time of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom","BACKGROUND: On 23rd March 2020, the UK government released self-isolation/social distancing guidance to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: ""On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?"" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

"Psychological Symptoms During the Two Stages of Lockdown in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Investigation in a Sample of Citizens in Northern Spain","Spain has been in a state of emergency since 14th March due to the COVID-19 crisis. This state of emergency means that the population must comply with strict rules such as lockdown (confinement to their homes except for essential trips) and social distancing. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological state of the general population in a sample recruited in Northern Spain. Sociodemographic and psychological data were gathered, assessing variables such as stress, anxiety, and depression. A questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the lockdown and three weeks later. The sample was recruited using an online questionnaire by means of a non-probabilistic snowball sampling methodology. A total of 1,933 people participated in this study. The results reveal that more than a quarter of the participants have reported symptoms of depression (27.5%), anxiety (26.9%) and stress (26.5%) and as the time spent in lockdown has progressed, psychological symptoms have risen. In relation to gender, data indicate that men have higher levels of depression than women, and similar levels of anxiety and stress. Greater symptomatology has also been found among the younger population and in people with chronic diseases. We discuss the need to continue carrying out these types of studies to prevent and treat psychological problems that could emerge amidst this pandemic.","Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Idoiaga Mondragon, Nahia; Dosil Santamaría, María; Picaza Gorrotxategi, Maitane","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01491",NA,"Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: Front.

"Assurer les soins aux patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant l'épidémie à SARS-CoV-2; [Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review]","OBJECTIVE: The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. METHODS: Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. RESULTS: We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. DISCUSSION: French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, A; Gourion, D; Hoertel, N; Llorca, P-M; Thomas, P; Bocher, R; Moro, M-R; Laprévote, V; Benyamina, A; Fossati, P; Masson, M; Leaune, E; Leboyer, M; Gaillard, R","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001",NA,"Country: FR; FRANÇA; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Encephale;46(3S): S3-S13, 2020 Jun.; Publication details: Encephale;46(3S): S3-S13, 2020 Jun.; Betacoronavirus; Continuity of Patient Care/organization & administration; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Mental Disorders/therapy; Mental Health Services/organization & administration; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Aftercare; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents/pharmacokinetics; Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use; Child; Cognition Disorders/epidemiology; Cognition Disorders/therapy; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Drug Interactions; France/epidemiology; Hospital Units/organization & administration; Hospitals, Psychiatric/organization & administration; Humans; Infection Control/methods; Mental Disorders/epidemiology; Mental Disorders/etiology; Mental Health Services/supply & distribution; Patient Care Team; Patient Compliance; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Prisoners/psychology; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/etiology; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/therapy; Stress, Psychological/etiology; Stress, Psychological/therapy; Substance-Related Disorders/epidemiology; Substance-Related Disorders/therapy; Suicide/prevention & control; Vulnerable Populations; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impacto psicológico de la COVID-19 en una muestra de profesionales sanitarios españoles; Impacto psicológico de la COVID-19 en una muestra de profesionales sanitarios españoles; Psychological impact of COVID-19 on a sample of Spanish health professionals","INTRODUCTION: After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. RESULTS: The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil Santamaría, María; Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Naiara; Redondo Rodríguez, Iratxe; Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Joana; Picaza Gorrotxategi, Maitane","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004",NA,"Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÑA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2020 Jun 02.; Publication details: Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment;2020 Jun 02.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: An emotional health perspective of Indians on Twitter","BACKGROUND: Novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) has spread in the world since its first human infection in December 2019. India has also witnessed a rising number of infections since March 2020. The Indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus. Tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind. AIM: Through this article, an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of Indian people using Python and R statistical software, during the recent lockdown 2.0 (15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020) and lockdown 3.0 (4 May 2020 to 17 May 2020) through their tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Also, opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed. METHOD: Analysis has been performed using Python and R statistical software. Also, recent articles related to COVID-19 have been considered and reviewed. RESULT: Although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness, disgust and others, the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0. CONCLUSION: This analysis can help the health specialists to understand people's mind-set, the authorities to take further corresponding measures in washing out the virus and the e-commerce stakeholders to adapt to the changing attitudes by adjusting demand and supply plans accordingly.","Chehal, Dimple; Gupta, Parul; Gulati, Payal","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940741",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020940741, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020940741, 2020 Jul 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID stress syndrome: Concept, structure, and correlates","BACKGROUND: Research shows that the COVID Stress Scales have a robust multifactorial structure, representing five correlated facets of COVID-19-related distress: (a) Fear of the dangerousness of COVID-19, which includes fear of coming into contact with fomites potentially contaminated with SARSCoV2, (b) worry about socioeconomic costs of COVID-19 (e.g., worry about personal finances and disruption in the supply chain), (c) xenophobic fears that foreigners are spreading SARSCoV2, (d) traumatic stress symptoms associated with direct or vicarious traumatic exposure to COVID-19 (nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or images related to COVID-19), and (e) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. METHODS: A population-representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self-report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID-19-related experiences, distress, and coping. RESULTS: Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID-19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi-dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID-19-related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self-isolation. CONCLUSION: The findings provide new information about the structure and correlates of COVID stress syndrome. Further research is needed to determine whether the syndrome will abate once the pandemic has passed or whether, for some individuals, it becomes a chronic condition.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh A; Paluszek, Michelle M; Fergus, Thomas A; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/da.23071",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Depress Anxiety;2020 Jul 05.; Publication details: Depress Anxiety;2020 Jul 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in Guangdong, China: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: During previous pandemic outbreaks, medical staff have reported high levels of psychological distress. The aim of the current study was to report a snapshot of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its correlated factors on medical staff in Guangdong, China. METHODS: On the 2nd and 3rd February 2020, soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed medical staff at four hospitals in Guangdong, China, to collect demographic characteristics, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. RESULTS: Complete responses were received from 1045 medical staff. Respondents were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to their working environment of contacting with potential or confirmed COVID-19 cases. The proportion of staff with anxiety (55.4% v. 43.0%, p < 0.001) or depression (43.6% v. 36.8%, p = 0.028) was significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group. The percentage of staff with severe anxiety was similar in the two groups. Doctors were more susceptible to moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. The high-risk group had higher levels of clinical insomnia (13.5% v. 8.5%, p = 0.011) and were more likely to be in the upper quartile for stress symptoms (24.7% v. 19.3%, p = 0.037) than the low-risk group. Additionally, work experience negatively correlated with insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: It is important for hospitals and authorities to protect both the physical and psychological health of medical staff during times of pandemic, even those with a low exposure risk.","Wang, Huajun; Huang, Daozheng; Huang, Huigen; Zhang, Jihui; Guo, Lan; Liu, Yuting; Ma, Huan; Geng, Qingshan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720002561",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-9, 2020 Jul 06.; Publication details: Psychol Med;: 1-9, 2020 Jul 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p&lt;0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p&lt;0.05). There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients.

"The relationship between resilience, anxiety, and depression among patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19 in China: A cross-sectional study","To explore the role of resilience in anxiety and depression and to clarify their relationships among patients with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. The outbreak of COVID-19 has negatively affected some individuals but resilience plays a decisive role in the response of individuals under pressure and can help them deal with pressure more effectively. The cross-sectional descriptive correlational survey was reported in line with the STROBE guidelines. In total, 296 patients from FangCang Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei, China with mild symptoms of COVID-19 were recruited. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling. The data collected included their demographic information, the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. A small number of the patients in this study had above threshold anxiety (subthreshold anxiety and major anxiety) and depression (subthreshold depression and major depression). The mean total resilience score of the participants was slightly below the normal level of ordinary Chinese adults. Resilience was inversely associated with and was a protective factor for both anxiety and depression in our samples. Risk factors for anxiety include being female and having colleagues with COVID-19, while a risk factor for depression was having family members with COVID-19. This study shows that after taking the general demographics into consideration, higher levels of resilience was associated with lower anxiety and depression among mild COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Health professionals, especially clinical nurses, need to be aware of the psychological status of COVID-19 patients and promote resilience in order to improve their mental health.","Zhang, Yang, Wang, Li, Dong, Wang, Li, Wei, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15425","20200723","Anxiety; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Depression; Resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Students under lockdown: Comparisons of students' social networks and mental health before and during the COVID-19 crisis in Switzerland","This study investigates students' social networks and mental health before and at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020, using longitudinal data collected since 2018. We analyze change on multiple dimensions of social networks (interaction, friendship, social support, co-studying) and mental health indicators (depression, anxiety, stress, loneliness) within two cohorts of Swiss undergraduate students experiencing the crisis (N = 212), and make additional comparisons to an earlier cohort which did not experience the crisis (N = 54). In within-person comparisons we find that interaction and co-studying networks had become sparser, and more students were studying alone. Furthermore, students' levels of stress, anxiety, loneliness, and depressive symptoms got worse, compared to measures before the crisis. Stressors shifted from fears of missing out on social life to worries about health, family, friends, and their future. Exploratory analyses suggest that COVID-19 specific worries, isolation in social networks, lack of interaction and emotional support, and physical isolation were associated with negative mental health trajectories. Female students appeared to have worse mental health trajectories when controlling for different levels of social integration and COVID-19 related stressors. As universities and researchers discuss future strategies on how to combine on-site teaching with online courses, our results indicate the importance of considering social contacts in students' mental health and offer starting points to identify and support students at higher risk of social isolation and negative psychological effects during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elmer, Mepham, Stadtfeld","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236337","20200723",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 lockdown impact on lifestyle habits of Italian adults","In March 2020, when the Government imposed nation-wide lockdown measures to contrast the COVID-19 outbreak, the life of Italians suddenly changed. In order to evaluate the impact of lockdown on lifestyle habits and behavioral risk factors of the general adult population in Italy, we set up the Lost in Italy (LOckdown and lifeSTyles IN ITALY) project. Within this project, the online panel of Doxa was used to conduct a web-based cross-sectional study during the first phase of the lockdown, on a large representative sample of adults aged 18-74 years (N=6003). The self-administered questionnaire included information on lifestyle habits and perceived physical and mental health, through the use of validated scales. As we are working within the Lost in Italy project, we got two additional grants to further research on the medium-term impact of lockdown, a topic of great interest and with anticipated large socio-economic and public health implications. In details: we obtained by the AXA Research Fund support to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on physical, mental, and social wellbeing of elderly and fragile populations in the Lombardy region, the area most heavily hit by the pandemic in the country. Moreover, as a fruitful integration, we obtained support by the Directorate General for Welfare of the region to assess health services delivery and access to healthcare in the same study population, combining an analysis of administrative databases with an economic analysis. We are confident that the solid background of our partners, the multi-disciplinary competencies they bring, together with appropriate funding and access to rich data sources will allow us to fulfill our research objectives.","Odone, Lugo, Amerio, Borroni, Bosetti, Carreras, Cavalieri d'Oro, Colombo, Fanucchi, Ghislandi, Gorini, Iacoviello, Pacifici, Santucci, Serafini, Signorelli, Stival, Stuckler, Tersalvi, Gallus","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i9-S.10122","20200723",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic: depicting chronicity of a new disease","The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak is posing considerable challenges to healthcare systems and societies worldwide. While the knowledge on the acute phase of the disease has rapidly expanded, little is known on the consequences of COVID-19 following clinical remission. We set up a multidisciplinary COVID-19 follow-up outpatient clinic to identify and address the clinical needs of COVID-19 survivors. Here we describe the features of our follow-up programme. The multidisciplinary assessment comprises a complete physical examination, respiratory evaluation (peripheral oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, dyspnoea assessment, lung ultrasound and pulmonary function), cardiovascular assessment (electrocardiography, echocardiography), nutritional assessment (anthropometrics, mini Nutritional Assessment screening tool), neurological examination including cognitive tests, and mental health assessment. All data are prospectively collected, and blood is sampled for biobanking. Since 7 April to 5 June, 2020, 453 out of the 1388 COVID-19 survivors managed at our University Hospital have been evaluated at the Outpatient COVID-19 Follow-up Clinic. The characteristics of the follow-up cohort are similar to those of the whole cohort of COVID-19 in terms of demographics, comorbidities, and COVID-19 severity upon ED presentation, indicating that the follow-up cohort is representative of the whole cohort. Continuous patient monitoring might give an answer to the numerous unsolved questions about what comes next in this pandemic and beyond. This will help physicians and researchers establish strategies to face future pandemics and develop preventative and therapeutic strategies for similar hyperinflammatory conditions.","Rovere Querini, De Lorenzo, Conte, Brioni, Lanzani, Yacoub, Chionna, Martinenghi, Vitali, Tresoldi, Ciceri","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i9-S.10146","20200723",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"What Media Helps, What Media Hurts: A Mixed Methods Survey Study of Coping with COVID-19 Using the Media Repertoire Framework and the Appraisal Theory of Stress","Social and physical distancing in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has made screen-mediated information and communication technologies (media) indispensable. Whether increase in screen usage is a source of or a relief for stress is to be seen. In the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 lockdowns we investigated the relation between subjective stress and changes in the pattern of media usage. Based on Lazarus's transactional model of appraisal and coping, and building on an earlier similar survey, we hypothesized that individual differences in the appraisal of media predicted variations in approach or avoidance of media for coping with COVID-19 stress. Between March 20 - April 20, 2020, a brief snow-ball survey entitled: &quot;What media helps, what media hurts: coping with COVID19 through screens.&quot; was distributed via Concordia University's mailing lists and social media (PERFORM Centre, EngAGE Centre, and Media Health Lab). Using a media-repertoires method, we asked questions about preferences, changes in usage, and personal appraisal of media experiences (approach, avoid, ignore) as a result of the COVID10 pandemic and investigated interindividual differences in media usage, by factors such as subjective stress, age, gender and self-reported mental health. More than 90% of the survey respondents were in Canada and the east coast of the US. From N=685 completed responses, 169 respondents were 'very stressed', and 452 were 'slightly worried' about COVID-19. COVID-19 stress led to increased use of Facebook (Ï‡2df=3. = 11.76, P=.008), Television (Ï‡2df=3. = 12.40, P=.006), YouTube (Ï‡ 2df=3. = 8.577, P=.035) and Netflix (Ï‡2df=3. = 10.71, P=.013). Respondents who considered their mental health &quot;not good&quot; were twice more likely to prefer streaming services as a coping tool for self-isolation. Women and none-binary respondents were twice more likely that men, to pick Social Media. Individuals &lt;35 years of age were 3 times more likely to pick Computer Games, and individuals older than 55 were more likely to pick Network Television/Print media. Gender affected the appraisal of media (Men &lt;others) in terms of Avoid (F(1,637)=5.84, P=.016) and Approach scores(F(1,637)=14.31, P&lt;.001). Subjective Mental Health affected Ignore score (Good &lt; Others) (F(1, 637) = 13.88, P&lt;.001). Appraisal score and usage increase explained variations in worrying about physical and mental health stress due to increased screen-time. A qualitative analysis of open-ended questions revealed that media (especially social networks) was important for coping, if they provided support and connection through dissemination of factual and positive information, while avoiding the overflow of sensational and false news. The relationship between appraisal of media's positive and negative facets vary with demographic differences in mental health resiliency. Media-repertoires approach is an important tool in studies that focus on assessing the benefits and harms of screen overuse in different populations, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Pahayahay, Khalili-Mahani","https://doi.org/10.2196/20186","20200723",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Puppy love in the time of Corona: Dog ownership protects against loneliness for those living alone during the COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in many countries enforcing a 'lockdown', whereby people are instructed to stay at home. The aim of this study was to capture the experience of such a lockdown in Australians living alone, with and without a dog or a cat. Three hundred and eighty-four participants completed an online survey evaluating their levels of loneliness, mindfulness and mood. For participants who owned a dog or a cat, a measure of dog/cat interactions was also administered as well as two open-ended questions about how being a pet owner affected their experience of COVID-19 and how COVID-19 affected their pet. Contrary to expectations, cat owners were found to be less mindful than non-owners and pet interactions did not account for levels of loneliness or levels of mindfulness. In line with our expectations, however, stress and depression positively predicted loneliness, while mindfulness and being a dog owner were protective against it. Insights from qualitative responses suggest that this might be due to the fact that dogs encourage a routine which involves getting out of the house and walking, which itself offers opportunities to socialise with other people doing the same thing. These findings add to the emerging literature on mental well-being during a lockdown and the unique role that pets play in their owners' experiences.","Oliva, Johnston","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020944195","20200723","COVID-19; cat; dog; loneliness; mindfulness; pet","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably impacted many people's lives. This study examined changes in subjective wellbeing between December 2019 and May 2020 and how stress appraisals and coping strategies relate to individual differences and changes in subjective wellbeing during the early stages of the pandemic. Data were collected at 4 time points from 979 individuals in Germany. Results showed that, on average, life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect did not change significantly between December 2019 and March 2020 but decreased between March and May 2020. Across the latter timespan, individual differences in life satisfaction were positively related to controllability appraisals, active coping, and positive reframing, and negatively related to threat and centrality appraisals and planning. Positive affect was positively related to challenge and controllable-by-self appraisals, active coping, using emotional support, and religion, and negatively related to threat appraisal and humor. Negative affect was positively related to threat and centrality appraisals, denial, substance use, and self-blame, and negatively related to controllability appraisals and emotional support. Contrary to expectations, the effects of stress appraisals and coping strategies on changes in subjective wellbeing were small and mostly nonsignificant. These findings imply that the COVID-19 pandemic represents not only a major medical and economic crisis, but also has a psychological dimension, as it can be associated with declines in key facets of people's subjective wellbeing. Psychological practitioners should address potential declines in subjective wellbeing with their clients and attempt to enhance clients' general capability to use functional stress appraisals and effective coping strategies.

"Applying relationship science to evaluate how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact couples' relationships","The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has profoundly altered people's daily lives and created multiple societal challenges. One important challenge of this unique stressor is maintaining well-functioning intimate relationships, which are inextricably tied to emotional and physical health. Yet research on romantic relationships shows that external stressors such as economic hardship, demanding jobs, and disasters can threaten the quality and stability of couples' relationships. Research within relationship science investigating how external stressors and existing vulnerabilities shape couple functioning can inform predictions about how the current pandemic will impact couples' relationships and which couples in which contexts may be most at risk for adverse relationship consequences. Drawing on theory and research from relationship science, the presented conceptual framework, adapted from the vulnerability-stress-adaptation model (Karney &amp; Bradbury, 1995), suggests that facing COVID-19-related external stress is likely to increase harmful dyadic processes (e.g., hostility, withdrawal, less responsive support), which will undermine couples' relationship quality. These harmful effects are likely to be exacerbated by the broader preexisting context in which couples' relationships are situated (e.g., social class, minority status, age), and their individual vulnerabilities (e.g., attachment insecurity, depression). The framework presented identifies the essential factors that need to be addressed in order to mitigate the potential adverse effects of the current crisis on relationships, and offers key directions for future research.

However, there has been no substantive discussion of potential long-term effects of COVID-19 on patient health or their financial and policy implications. After recovery, patients remain at risk for lung disease, heart disease, frailty, and mental health disorders. There may also be long-term sequelae of adverse events that develop in the course of COVID-19 and its treatment. These complications are likely to place additional medical, psychological, and economic burdens on all patients, with lower-income individuals, the uninsured and underinsured, and individuals experiencing homelessness being most vulnerable. Thus, there needs to be a comprehensive plan for preventing and managing post-COVID-19 complications to quell their clinical, economic, and public health consequences and to support patients experiencing delayed morbidity and disability as a result.","Jiang, McCoy","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-06042-3","20200725","COVID-19; access to care; cost-sharing; underinsured; uninsured","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Debunking Cannabidiol as a Treatment for COVID-19: Time for the FDA to Adopt a Focused Deterrence Model?","Many cannabidiol (CBD) retailers make unsupported medical claims about their product. In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has sent warning letters to CBD retailers who promoted CBD to treat Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes, and other serious conditions for which there is no evidence of its efficacy as a treatment or preventive. Compliance with these warning letters has been low. During the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the FDA has begun sending more strongly worded warning letters that appear to have better compliance in that most of these companies have removed COVID-19-related claims. However, many continue to present other unsupported medical claims on other serious medical conditions like cancer, depression, addiction, and bone fractures, among many others. We argue that adopting a strategy of focused deterrence where the FDA prioritizes enforcement related to COVID-19 claims - but when COVID-19-related claims are found, pursues all other violations by that company - would present an opportunity to efficiently cut down on harmful claims overstating CBD's benefits.","Shover, Humphreys","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.8671","20200724","cannabidiol; cannabis; covid-19; food and drug administration; health policy; regulation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Going digital: how technology use may influence human brains and behaviorâ€©","The digital revolution has changed, and continues to change, our world and our lives. Currently, major aspects of our lives have moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic, and social distancing has necessitated virtual togetherness. In a synopsis of 10 articles we present ample evidence that the use of digital technology may influence human brains and behavior in both negative and positive ways. For instance, brain imaging techniques show concrete morphological alterations in early childhood and during adolescence that are associated with intensive digital media use. Technology use apparently affects brain functions, for example visual perception, language, and cognition. Extensive studies could not confirm common concerns that excessive screen time is linked to mental health problems, or the deterioration of well-being. Nevertheless, it is important to use digital technology consciously, creatively, and sensibly to improve personal and professional relationships. Digital technology has great potential for mental health assessment and treatment, and the improvement of personal mental performance.â€©. La revoluciÃ³n digital ha cambiado y continÃºa cambiando nuestro mundo y nuestras vidas. Actualmente, los principales aspectos de nuestras vidas han migrado hacia el funcionamiento â€œonlineâ€ debido a la pandemia del coronavirus, y el distanciamiento social ha requerido de cercanÃ­as virtuales. En una sinopsis de 10 artÃ­culos, se presenta una amplia evidencia de que el empleo de la tecnologÃ­a digital puede influir en el cerebro y en el comportamiento humano de manera negativa y positiva. Por ejemplo, las tÃ©cnicas de imÃ¡genes cerebrales muestran alteraciones morfolÃ³gicas concretas en la primera infancia y durante la adolescencia, las cuales estÃ¡n asociadas con el empleo intenso de medios digitales. En apariencia, la utilizaciÃ³n de la tecnologÃ­a afecta las funciones cerebrales, como la percepciÃ³n visual, el lenguaje y la cogniciÃ³n. Numerosos estudios no pudieron confirmar las preocupaciones comunes en cuanto a que el tiempo excesivo de pantalla estÃ© relacionado con problemas de salud mental o el deterioro del bienestar. Sin embargo, es importante emplear la tecnologÃ­a digital de manera consciente, creativa y sensata para mejorar las relaciones personales y profesionales. La tecnologÃ­a digital tiene un gran potencial para la evaluaciÃ³n y el tratamiento de la salud mental, y el aumento del rendimiento mental personal. La rÃ©volution numÃ©rique a modifiÃ© et continue Ã modifier notre monde et nos vies. La pandÃ©mie actuelle due au coronavirus a fait basculer en ligne de nombreux pans de notre existence et la distanciation sociale a imposÃ© la virtualitÃ© des rassemblements.

"[Impact of SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) on the mental health of healthcare professionals: a systematic review]","In times of this global pandemic situation, population's mental health is compromised, especially in those groups that are at the forefront of defence against the virus such as healthcare professionals. The objective of this study was to analyze the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak on healthcare professionals' mental health. A systematic review was carried out following the PRISMA format in Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect electronic databases between January and May 2020. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for non-randomized studies. A total of 13 studies were included in this review. Professionals' mental health and mental functions were compromised, being especially affected those professionals on the front line of battle against the virus. However, these stats were below the general population data. Although there is wide variability of results, medium-high levels of anxiety (26,5%-44,6%), depression (8,1%-25%), concern and insomnia are detected (23,6%-38%). Paradoxically, stress levels were below expectations (3,8%-68,3%). The mental well-being of health professionals working on the front line is compromised in times of pandemic by presenting medium-high levels of anxiety, depression, nervousness and insomnia, and, to a lesser extent, stress.

"No clear association emerges between intergenerational relationships and COVID-19 fatality rates from macro-level analyses","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 originated in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 and rapidly spread in more than 100 countries. Researchers in different fields have been working on finding explanations for the unequal impact of the virus and deaths from the associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) across geographical areas. Demographers and other social scientists have hinted at the importance of demographic factors, such as age structure and intergenerational relationships. Our aim is to reflect on the possible link between intergenerational relationships and spread and lethality of COVID-19 in a critical way. We show that with available aggregate data it is not possible to draw robust evidence to support these links. In fact, despite a higher prevalence of intergenerational coresidence and contacts that is broadly positively associated with COVID-19 case fatality rates at the country level, the opposite is generally true at the subnational level. While this inconsistent evidence demonstrates neither the existence nor the absence of a causal link between intergenerational relationships and the severity of COVID-19, we warn against simplistic interpretations of the available data, which suffer from many shortcomings. We conclude by arguing that intergenerational relationships are not only about physical contacts between family members. Theoretically, different forms of intergenerational relationships may have causal effects of opposite sign on the diffusion of COVID-19. Policies should also take into account that intergenerational ties are a source of instrumental and emotional support, which may favor compliance to the lockdown and &quot;phase-2&quot; restrictions and may buffer their negative consequences on mental health.","Arpino, Bordone, Pasqualini","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2008581117","20200723","COVID-19; coresidence; coronavirus; intergenerational contacts; intergenerational relationships","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Consensus on Recommendations for Safe Sexual Activity during the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic","Sexual activity offers numerous advantages for physical and mental health but maintains inherent risks in a pandemic situation, such as the current one caused by SARS-CoV-2. A group of experts from the Spanish Association of Sexuality and Mental Health (AESexSAME) has reached a consensus on recommendations to maintain lower-risk sexual activity, depending on one's clinical and partner situations, based on the current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2. Different situations are included in the recommendations: a sexual partner passing quarantine without any symptoms, a sexual partner that has not passed quarantine, a sexual partner with some suspicious symptoms of COVID-19, a positive sexual partner with COVID-19, a pregnant sexual partner, a health professional partner in contact with COVID-19 patients, and people without a sexual partner. The main recommendations include returning to engaging in safe sex after quarantine is over (28 days based on the duration one can carry SARS-CoV-2, or 33 days for those who are &gt;60 years old) and all parties are asymptomatic. In all other cases (for those under quarantine, those with some clinical symptoms, health professionals in contact with COVID-19 patients, and during pregnancy), abstaining from coital/oral/anal sex, substituting it with masturbatory or virtual sexual activity to provide maximum protection from the contagion, and increasing the benefits inherent to sexual activity are recommended. For persons without a partner, not initiating sexual activity with a sporadic partner is strongly recommended.","Cabello, SÃ¡nchez, FarrÃ©, Montejo","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072297","20200723","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; consensus; recommendations; sexual activity; sexual risk","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Symptoms in Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Epidemic A Cross-Sectional Survey","In March-April 2020, the Corona Virus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic suddenly hit Italian healthcare facilities and in some of them many staff members became infected. In this work 595 health care workers from a public company were tested for Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (82 positive) and asked to complete a questionnaire on early COVID-19 symptoms. Respiratory symptoms were present in 56.1% of cases. Anosmia and dysgeusia in COVID-19 cases were found to have an odds ratio (OR) = 100.7 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 26.5-382.6) and an OR = 51.8 (95%CI 16.6-161.9), respectively. About one in three of the cases (29.3%) never manifested symptoms. Anxiety was reported by 16.6% of COVID-19 cases and depression by 20.3%, with a significant increase in the estimated risk (OR = 4.3; 95%CI = 2.4-7.4 for anxiety, OR = 3.5; 95%CI = 2.0-6.0 for depression). In cases, sleep was a significant moderating factor in the relationship between occupational stress, or organizational justice, and anxiety. The early diagnosis of COVID-19 in health care workers, must consider, in addition to respiratory disorders and fever, anosmia, dysgeusia, exhaustion, myalgias and enteric disorders. The frequency of anxiety and depression disorders in the population examined was not higher than that commonly recorded in the same company during periodic checks in the years preceding the epidemic. In COVID-19 cases there was a significant risk of anxiety, especially in those who had low sleep quality. Mental health support and improvement interventions must mainly concern workers with positive tests and should also tend to improve sleep quality.","Magnavita, Tripepi, Di Prinzio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145218","20200724","anosmia; anxiety; depression; dysgeusia; effort/reward imbalance; occupational disease; occupational epidemiology; occupational stress; organizational justice; sleep quality","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Panic and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people: An online pilot survey early in the outbreak","Precisely how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health worldwide is currently poorly understood. The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a joint family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Islam, Ferdous, Potenza","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.049","20200724","Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; General population; Panic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Electroconvulsive therapy protocol adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, electroconvulsive therapy units have had to confront challenges such as the infectious hazard due to aerosol-generating ventilation, or the lack of staff and material resources. Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital ClÃ­nic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations' guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. The protocol includes the following main areas: (1) ECT unit's structural and functional considerations; (2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; (3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); (4) management of COVID-19 cases; and (5) protocol assessment. The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol. This proposal may be used as a reference.","Gil-Badenes, Valero, ValentÃ­, Macau, Bertran, Claver, Bioque, Baeza, Bastidas SalvadÃ³, LombraÃ±a Mencia, Pacchiarotti, Bernardo, Vieta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.051","20200724","COVID-19; Coronavirus; ECT; Electroconvulsive therapy; Protocol; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"An analysis on the panic during COVID-19 pandemic through an online form","With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (pÂ =Â 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (pÂ =Â 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent regardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients.

"The impact of COVID-19 on the cancer care of adolescents and young adults and their well-being: Results from an online survey conducted in the early stages of the pandemic","Because of the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), oncology departments across the world have rapidly adapted their cancer care protocols to balance the risk of delaying cancer treatments and the risk of COVID-19 exposure. COVID-19 and associated changes may have an impact on the psychosocial functioning of patients with cancer and survivors. This study was designed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young people living with and beyond cancer. In this cross-sectional study, 177 individuals, aged 18 to 39 years, were surveyed about the impact of COVID-19 on their cancer care and psychological well-being. Participants also reported their information needs with respect to COVID-19. Responses were summarized with a content analysis approach. This was the first study to examine the psychological functioning of young patients and survivors during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. A third of the respondents reported increased levels of psychological distress, and as many as 60% reported feeling more anxious than they did before COVID-19. More than half also wanted more information tailored to them as young patients with cancer. The COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving and changing the landscape of cancer care. Young people living with cancer are a unique population and might be more vulnerable during this time in comparison with their healthy peers. There is a need to screen for psychological distress and attend to young people whose cancer care has been delayed. As the lockdown begins to ease, the guidelines about cancer care should be updated according to this population's needs.","KoÅ¡ir, Loades, Wild, Wiedemann, Krajnc, RoÅ¡kar, Bowes","https://doi.org/10.1002/cncr.33098","20200722","adolescent cancer; anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); depression; information needs; survey; young adult cancer","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Medication treatment for opioid use disorder and community pharmacy: Expanding care during a national epidemic and global pandemic","Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), such as methadone and buprenorphine, are effective strategies for treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) and reducing overdose risk. MOUD treatment rates continue to be low across the US, and currently, some evidence suggests access to evidence-based treatment is becoming increasingly difficult for those with OUD as a result of the 2019 novel corona virus (COVID-19). A major underutilized source to address these serious challenges in the US is community pharmacy given the specialized training of pharmacists, high levels of consumer trust, and general availability for accessing these service settings. Canadian, Australian, and European pharmacists have made important contributions to the treatment and care of those with OUD over the past decades. Unfortunately, US pharmacists are not permitted to prescribe MOUD and are only currently allowed to dispense methadone for the treatment of pain, not OUD. US policymakers, regulators, and practitioners must work to facilitate this advancement of community pharmacy-based through research, education, practice, and industry. Advancing community pharmacy-based MOUD for leading clinical management of OUD and dispensation of treatment medications will afford the US a critical innovation for addressing the opioid epidemic, fallout from COVID-19, and getting individuals the care they need.","Cochran, Bruneau, Cox, Gordon","https://doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1787300","20200724","COVID-19; Community pharmacy; Medication for opioid use disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Reckoning With the Relation Between Stressors and Suicide Attempts in a Time of Covid-19","The Covid-19 pandemic presents a unique set of risk exposures to populations, which may lead to an increase in suicide. While large-scale traumatic events are known to increase psychological disorders, thus far the science has not shown a clear link between these events and suicide. In their paper in this issue, Elbogen and colleagues (Am J Epidemiol. 2020;(XX):XXXX-XXXX) use representative data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) to show that four dimensions of financial strain-financial debt/crisis, unemployment, past homelessness, lower income-are associated with subsequent suicide attempts. There are three main learnings we may take from Elbogen et al: first, with populations facing record-breaking unemployment, economic recession, and reduced wages, we can anticipate an increase in suicide in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, these data show the centrality of financial stressors, marking the current moment as distinct from other disasters or large-scale trauma. Third, the data teach us that financial stressors are linked, and cumulative. In this way, the paper is a sobering harbinger of the potential effects on suicide of the collective stressors borne by the Covid-19 pandemic and other mass traumatic events that are accompanied by substantial financial stressors.","Ettman, Gradus, Galea","https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa147","20200722","economic recession; financial stressors; mental health; suicide; trauma; unemployment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"HIV and SARS-CoV-2: Intersecting Epidemics with Many Unknowns","As of July 2020, approximately 6 months into the pandemic of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), whether people living with HIV (PLWH) are disproportionately affected remains an unanswered question. Thus far, risk of COVID-19 in people with and without HIV appears similar but data are sometimes contradictory. Some uncertainty is due to the recency of the emergence of COVID-19 and sparsity of data; some is due to imprecision about what it means for HIV to be a &quot;risk factor&quot; for COVID-19. Forthcoming studies on the risk of COVID-19 to PLWH should differentiate between 1) the unadjusted, excess burden of disease among PLWH to inform surveillance efforts; and 2) any excess risk of COVID-19 among PLWH due to biological effects of HIV, independent of comorbidities that confound rather than mediate this effect. PLWH bear a disproportionate burden of alcohol, other drug use, mental health disorders, and other structural vulnerabilities, which may increase their risk of COVID-19. In addition to any direct effects of COVID-19 on the health of PLWH, we need to understand how physical distancing restrictions impact secondary health outcomes, and the need for, accessibility of, and impact of alternative modalities of providing ongoing medical, mental health, and substance use treatment that comply with physical distancing restrictions (e.g., telemedicine).","Lesko, Bengtson","https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwaa158","20200722","COVID-19; Engagement in care; HIV; Mental health; Substance use; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Chronic Neurology in COVID-19 Era: Clinical Considerations and Recommendations From the REPROGRAM Consortium","With the rapid pace and scale of the emerging coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, a growing body of evidence has shown a strong association of COVID-19 with pre- and post- neurological complications. This has necessitated the need to incorporate targeted neurological care for this subgroup of patients which warrants further reorganization of services, healthcare workforce, and ongoing management of chronic neurological cases. The social distancing and the shutdown imposed by several nations in the midst of COVID-19 have severely impacted the ongoing care, access and support of patients with chronic neurological conditions such as Multiple Sclerosis, Epilepsy, Neuromuscular Disorders, Migraine, Dementia, and Parkinson disease. There is a pressing need for governing bodies including national and international professional associations, health ministries and health institutions to harmonize policies, guidelines, and recommendations relating to the management of chronic neurological conditions. These harmonized guidelines should ensure patient continuity across the spectrum of hospital and community care including the well-being, safety, and mental health of the patients, their care partners and the health professionals involved.

"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Canadian adolescents (nÂ = 1,054, M<sub>age</sub>Â = 16.68, standard deviationÂ = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3Â weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","Dumas, Ellis, Litt","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200724","Adolescent; Alcohol; COVID-19; Cannabis; Substance use; Vaping","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Clinical characteristics and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei","In December, 2019, a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. We aimed to clarify the epidemiology, laboratory examinations, imaging findings, and treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 in Hebei province, China. In this retrospective study, the demographic, laboratory and imaging, and treatment data of patients with severe COVID-19 treated in 13 designated hospitals in Hebei were collected and analyzed. A total of 319 severe COVID-19 patients were treated at the 13 designated hospitals between 22 January, 2020 and 25 March, 2020. Eventually, 51 critically ill (31 severe cases and 20 critically severe cases) patients were included in the analysis. The patients had an average age of 58.9Â±13.7 years, and 27 (52.9%) were men. Twenty-one (41.2%) were familial cluster, and 33 (64.7%) had chronic illnesses. The patients in critically severe group had longer duration from symptom to confirmation, more severe infections, more severe lung injury, and a lower percentage of lymphocytes. All 51 patients received antiviral drugs, 47 (92.2%) received antibacterial agents, 49 (96.1%) received traditional Chinese drugs, and 46 (90.2%) received methylprednisolone.

"Associations between COVID-19 related media consumption and symptoms of anxiety, depression and COVID-19 related fear in the general population in Germany","In context of the current COVID-19 pandemic the consumption of pandemic-related media coverage may be an important factor that is associated with anxiety and psychological distress. Aim of the study was to examine those associations in the general population in Germany. 6233 participants took part in an online-survey (March 27th-April 6th, 2020), which included demographic information and media exploitation in terms of duration, frequency and types of media. Symptoms of depression, unspecific anxiety and COVID-19 related anxiety were ascertained with standardized questionnaires. Frequency, duration and diversity of media exposure were positively associated with more symptoms of depression and unspecific and COVID-19 specific anxiety. We obtained the critical threshold of seven times per day and 2.5Â h of media exposure to mark the difference between mild and moderate symptoms of (un)specific anxiety and depression. Particularly the usage of social media was associated with more pronounced psychological strain. Participants with pre-existing fears seem to be particularly vulnerable for mental distress related to more immoderate media consumption. Our findings provide some evidence for problematical associations of COVID-19 related media exposure with psychological strain and could serve as an orientation for recommendations-especially with regard to the thresholds of critical media usage.","Bendau, Petzold, Pyrkosch, Mascarell Maricic, Betzler, Rogoll, GroÃŸe, StrÃ¶hle, Plag","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01171-6","20200724","Corona; Media coverage; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: a UK-based focus group study","This study explored UK public perceptions and experiences of social distancing and social isolation related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This qualitative study comprised five focus groups, carried out online during the early stages of the UK's stay at home order ('lockdown'), and analysed using a thematic approach. Focus groups took place via online videoconferencing. Participants (n=27) were all UK residents aged 18 years and older, representing a range of gender, ethnic, age and occupational backgrounds. Qualitative analysis revealed four main themes: (1) loss-participants' loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine led to psychological and emotional 'losses' such as loss of motivation, loss of meaning and loss of self-worth; (2) criticisms of government communication-participants reported a lack of trust in government and a lack of clarity in the guidelines around social distancing and isolation; (3) adherence-participants reported high self-adherence to social distancing guidelines but reported seeing or hearing of non-adherence in others; (4) uncertainty around social reintegration and the future-some participants felt they would have lingering concerns over social contact while others were eager to return to high levels of social activity.Most participants, and particularly those in low-paid or precarious employment, reported feeling that the social distancing and isolation associated with COVID-19 policy has had negative impacts on their mental health and well-being during the early stages of the UK's 'lockdown'. A rapid response is necessary in terms of public health programming to mitigate the mental health impacts of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Social distancing and isolation 'exit strategies' must account for the fact that, although some individuals will voluntarily or habitually continue to socially distance, others will seek high levels of social engagement as soon as possible.","Williams, Armitage, Tampe, Dienes","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-039334","20200722","mental health; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 on healthcare workers: a scoping review","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has spread to 198 countries, with approximately 2.4 million confirmed cases and 150,000 deaths globally as of April 18. Frontline healthcare workers (HCWs) face a substantially higher risk of infection and death due to excessive COVID-19 exposure. This review aimed at summarizing the evidence of the physical and mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on health-care workers (HCWs). We used the Arksey O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. A systematic literature search was conducted using two databases: PubMed and Google Scholar. We found 154 studies, and out of which 10 met our criteria. We collected information on the date of publication, first author's country, the title of the article, study design, study population, intervention and outcome, and key findings, and divided all research articles into two domains: physical and mental health impact. We reviewed a total of 154 articles from PubMed (126) and Google Scholar (28), of which 58 were found to be duplicate articles and were excluded. Of the remaining 96 articles, 82 were excluded after screening for eligibility, and 4 articles did not have available full texts. Ten full-text articles were reviewed and included in this study. Our findings identified the following risk factors for COVID-19-related health impact: working in a high-risk department, diagnosed family member, inadequate hand hygiene, suboptimal hand hygiene before and after contact with patients, improper PPE use, close contact with patients (â‰¥ 12 times/day), long daily contact hours (â‰¥ 15 h), and unprotected exposure. The most common symptoms identified amongst HCWs were fever (85%), cough (70%), and weakness (70%). Prolonged PPE usage led to cutaneous manifestations and skin damage (97%), with the nasal bridge (83%) most commonly affected site. HCWs experienced high levels of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. Female HCWs and nurses were disproportionately affected. The frontline healthcare workers are at risk of physical and mental consequences directly as the result of providing care to patients with COVID-19. Even though there are few intervention studies, early data suggest implementation strategies to reduce the chances of infections, shorter shift lengths, and mechanisms for mental health support could reduce the morbidity and mortality amongst HCWs.","Shaukat, Ali, Razzak","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12245-020-00299-5","20200724","COVID-19; Health impacts; Healthcare workers; Occupational health; Risk factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Adjustment Disorder, Depression, Stress Symptoms, Corona Related Anxieties and Coping Strategies during the Corona Pandemic (COVID-19) in Swiss Medical Staff]","International studies point to increased mental health problems of medical staff during the Corona pandemic (COVID-19). This is the first study to investigate mental health, i.â€‰e. adjustment disorder, depression, stress symptoms, Corona related fears as well as coping mechanisms in this group in a German-speaking country. In April 2020, N=100 subjects were recruited that currently are engaged in a hospital. A series of standardized assessments were included: adjustment disorder (ADNM-20), depression (PHQ-9), stress symptoms and coping strategies (SCI). Currently, cross-sectional data are analyzed, because the study is still going on and longitudinal data is not yet assessed. Frequencies of adjustment disorder and depression are 8 and 15%, respectively. Two hierarchical regression models were run to predict adjustment disorder and depression; predictive power was higher for the first (41 vs. 35%). Fear of infection was reported to be higher regarding one's family than oneself. Nursing staff, those with preloads, and women were found to report more mental health problems. Those with direct contact to people that fell ill with COVID-19 did not differ from those with no direct contact. Currently, medical staff has a high risk for being mentally stressed. China, being epidemically experienced, has published principles for psychiatric interventions in January 2020. This might be relevant for Switzerland, too. Specific psychotherapeutic interventions, targeting at cognitive restructuring and sensitizing regarding dealing with alcohol and cigarettes, may be needed in order to protect this vulnerable group of person during and after the Corona pandemic.

"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5Â years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Tisler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","20200723","COVID-19; Cancer; Cardiovascular diseases; Global health; Health burden; Infectious diseases; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (pÂ &lt;Â .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(pÂ &lt;Â .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Alrashed, Alzunaydi, Almohimeed, Aljohani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152192","20200723","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Depression; IES; Knowledge; Pandemic; Precaution; Psychological impact; Saudi Arabia; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We estimated associations between pre-existing diagnoses and hospitalized COVID-19 alone or with mortality, in a large community cohort. UK Biobank (England) participants with baseline assessment 2006 to 2010, followed in hospital discharge records to 2017 and death records to 2020. Demographic and pre-existing common diagnoses association tested with hospitalized laboratory confirmed COVID-19 (16th March to 26th April 2020), alone or with mortality, in logistic models. Of 269,070 participants aged 65+, 507 (0.2%) became COVID-19 hospital inpatients, of which 141 (27.8%) died. Common co-morbidities in hospitalized inpatients were hypertension (59.6%), history of fall or fragility fractures (29.4%), coronary heart disease (CHD, 21.5%), type 2 diabetes (type 2, 19. 9%) and asthma (17.6%). However, in models adjusted for comorbidities, age-group, sex, ethnicity and education, pre-existing diagnoses of dementia, type 2 diabetes, COPD, pneumonia, depression, atrial fibrillation and hypertension emerged as independent risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization, the first five remaining statistically significant for related mortality. Chronic Kidney Disease and asthma were risk factors for COVID-19 hospitalization in women but not men. There are specific high risk pre-existing co-morbidities for COVID-19 hospitalization and related deaths in community based older men and women.

"Debate: Exposing the most serious infirmity-racism's impact on health in the era of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic retells a story that other diseases like HIV, diabetes, and cancer have clearly internationally illustrated. Minorities in developed countries across the globe - especially those of African, Hispanic, and Native American descent - suffer a greater burden of disease than whites. The evidence of the cause and effect relationship of racism on mental and minority health outcomes is staggering. Racism and its influence on policy and important structural systems allow health inequities across racial and ethnic groups to persist. What's more troubling is how systemic racism impacts children from all races and has been perpetuated across many generations dating back hundreds of years. The impact of racial oppression is seen through intergenerational trauma which impacts youth in varying ways. For this article, we offer three areas in which racism causes healthcare disparities, intergenerational trauma, social determinants, and cultural mistrust. Effective policy change and a greater level of accountability must be placed on major systems including health care, to most fully counter racism's varied role in sustaining mental health inequities.","Farquharson, Thornton","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12407","20200720",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker.

"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","Noorbhai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200721","Coronavirus; Economy; Health; Lockdown; Model; Norms","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The analysis of the cross-sectional studies showed that the risk bias was higher in the identification, control and accuracy of the confounding factors, and the description of the reliability and validity of the outcome indicators was unclear. The analysis of the case series studies showed that the overall risk bias was small, but there was a lack of a comprehensive description of the assessment when selecting patients. A total of 33 TCM syndromes of COVID-19 were sorted out by combining the TCM syndromes with the same disease position and pathogenic syndrome in the included 18 literatures, and there were 10 types of TCM syndromes of which the number of occurrences was â‰¥ 50, the incidence rate was â‰¥ 10%, and had statistical significance [indicated that 95% confidence interval (95%CI) didn't cross the meaningless line 0], including cold dampness syndrome (469 cases, incidence rate was 28.2%, 95%CI was 5.9%-50.6%), damp heat syndrome (247 cases, incidence rate was 32.1%, 95%CI was 10.7%-53.6%), epidemic closed lung syndrome (228 cases, incidence rate was 28.9%, 95%CI was 12.5%-45.2%), pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (202 cases, incidence rate was 22.1%, 95%CI was 9.5%-34.7%), dampness stagnation lung syndrome (180 cases, incidence rate was 41.2%, 95%CI was 18.4%-64.1%), dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome (81 cases, incidence rate was 56.3%, 95%CI was 48.1%-64.4%), evil heat syndrome lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%), dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome (70 cases, incidence rate was 13.4%, 95%CI was 10.4%-16.3%), heat poisoning lung closure syndrome (55 cases, incidence rate was 16.9%, 95%CI was 8.3%-25.5%), and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). Subgroup analysis showed that there were 6 types of TCM syndromes that met the above conditions in cross-sectional studies, namely cold and damp lung syndrome (200 cases, incidence rate was 20.9%, 95%CI was 12.6%-29.2%), damp heat syndrome (221 cases, incidence rate was 41.8%, 95%CI was 9.4%-74.2%), dampness-disease lung syndrome (120 cases, incidence rate was 41.4%, 95%CI was 8.6%-74.3%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (115 cases, incidence rate was 19.2%, 95%CI was 6.8%-31.7%), heat-fever lung syndrome (76 cases, incidence rate was 31.1%, 95%CI was 25.3%-36.9%) and Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome (53 cases, incidence rate was 13.7%, 95%CI was 2.7%-24.8%). There were 3 kinds of TCM syndromes in case series studies, which were virus closed lung syndrome (133 cases, incidence rate was 44.0%, 95%CI was 24.5%-63.4%), lung and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome (87 cases, incidence rate was 38.7%, 95%CI was 32.3%-45.0%), and dampness and depression lung syndrome (60 cases, incidence rate was 40.6%, 95%CI was 29.3%-52.0%). The TCM syndromes of COVID-19 syndrome were widely distributed and complex. The main TCM syndromes were cold dampness syndrome, damp heat syndrome, epidemic closed lung syndrome, pulmonary and spleen Qi deficiency syndrome, dampness stagnation lung syndrome, dampness obstructing lung and spleen syndrome, evil heat syndrome lung syndrome, dampness-blocking lung and stomach syndrome, heat poisoning lung closure syndrome, Qi-Yin deficiency syndrome, which can provide reference for the standard of TCM syndrome differentiation of COVID-19.","Li, Liu, He, Xie, Li","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn121430-202000509-00372","20200722","Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Reproducibility of Results; Syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: A call to action for psychological science","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic represents the greatest international biopsychosocial emergency the world has faced for a century, and psychological science has an integral role to offer in helping societies recover. The aim of this paper is to set out the shorter- and longer-term priorities for research in psychological science that will (a) frame the breadth and scope of potential contributions from across the discipline; (b) enable researchers to focus their resources on gaps in knowledge; and (c) help funders and policymakers make informed decisions about future research priorities in order to best meet the needs of societies as they emerge from the acute phase of the pandemic. The research priorities were informed by an expert panel convened by the British Psychological Society that reflects the breadth of the discipline; a wider advisory panel with international input; and a survey of 539 psychological scientists conducted early in May 2020. The most pressing need is to research the negative biopsychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to facilitate immediate and longer-term recovery, not only in relation to mental health, but also in relation to behaviour change and adherence, work, education, children and families, physical health and the brain, and social cohesion and connectedness. We call on psychological scientists to work collaboratively with other scientists and stakeholders, establish consortia, and develop innovative research methods while maintaining high-quality, open, and rigorous research standards.","O'Connor, Aggleton, Chakrabarti, Cooper, Creswell, Dunsmuir, Fiske, Gathercole, Gough, Ireland, Jones, Jowett, Kagan, Karanika-Murray, Kaye, Kumari, Lewandowsky, Lightman, Malpass, Meins, Morgan, Morrison Coulthard, Reicher, Schacter, Sherman, Simms, Williams, Wykes, Armitage","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12468","20200719","COVID-19; behaviour change; children; education; families; health; human development; mental health; neuroscience; pandemic; psychological science; psychology; school; stress; trauma; work","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter","We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. During the period of May 1-4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.","Croll, Kurzweil, Hasanaj, Serrano, Balcer, Galetta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034","20200724","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Residency; Resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Brown, Karp, Lenard, Cameron, Dawdani, Lavretsky, Miller, Mulsant, Pham, Reynolds, Roose, Lenze","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013","20200722","Covid-19 Pandemic; anxiety; depression; resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The unpredictability and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic; the associated lockdowns, physical distancing, and other containment strategies; and the resulting economic breakdown could increase the risk of mental health problems and exacerbate health inequalities. Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services.","Moreno, Wykes, Galderisi, Nordentoft, Crossley, Jones, Cannon, Correll, Byrne, Carr, Chen, Gorwood, Johnson, KÃ¤rkkÃ¤inen, Krystal, Lee, Lieberman, LÃ³pez-Jaramillo, MÃ¤nnikkÃ¶, Phillips, Uchida, Vieta, Vita, Arango","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2215-0366(20)30307-2","20200722",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Hospital suicide due to non-treatment by healthcare staff fearing COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh?","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to individuals fearing COVID-19 infection alongside conditions such anxiety, depression, trauma, and stress. For a small minority, such mental health factors can contribute to suicide. Here we report a novel reason for suicide and seemingly COVID-19-related - negligence in getting treatment by Bangladeshi healthcare providers. It was alleged that a woman committed suicide at a hospital because she was not treated and because doctors and nurses suspected she was infected with COVID-19 and did not want to get infected themselves. To help allay the fears among HCPs and the patients they are treating with COVID-19, a number of initiatives are suggested.","Mamun, Bodrud-Doza, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102295","20200722","COVID-19 fear; COVID-19 suicide; COVID-19 treatment issues; Healthcare professionals; Treatment negligence","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity on mental health during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in Austria","The impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported for different countries. This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. An online survey was performed through QualtricsÂ® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). In total, NÂ =Â 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off â‰¥10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off â‰¥10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off â‰¥15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35Â years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values &lt;.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia.

"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants' demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients' self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients' mental health. Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9Â â‰¥Â 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7Â â‰¥Â 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISIÂ â‰¥Â 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1Î² and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients' self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (Î²Â =Â 0.313, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (Î²Â =Â 0.411, PÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (Î²Â =Â 0.358, PÂ =Â 0.002) had direct effects on patients' mental health. The disease duration (Î²Â =Â 0.163, PÂ =Â 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (Î²Â =Â 0.101, PÂ =Â 0.016) also indirectly affected patients' mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients' mental symptoms.","Hu, Chen, Zheng, You, Tan, Hu, Zhang, Ding","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20200724","COVID-19; Hospitalization; Inflammatory markers; Mental health; Patients","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Implementing COVID-19 Mitigation in the Community Mental Health Setting: March 2020 and Lessons Learned","In March 2020, at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, state-funded community mental health service programs (CMHSP) in Michigan, organized into 10 regions known as a &quot;Prepaid Inpatient Health Plan&quot; (PIHP), grappled with the task of developing a modified plan of operations, while complying with mitigation and social distancing guidelines. With the premise that psychiatric care is essential healthcare, a panel of physician and non-physician leaders representing Region 5, met and developed recommendations, and feedback iteratively, using an adaptive modified Delphi methodology. This facilitated the development of a service and patient prioritization document to triage and to deliver behavioral health services in 21 counties which comprised Region 5 PIHP. Our procedures were organized around the principles of mitigation and contingency management, like physical health service delivery paradigms. The purpose of this manuscript is to share region 5 PIHP's response; a process which has allowed continuity of care during these unprecedented times.","Alavi, Haque, Felzer-Kim, Lewicki, Haque, Mormann","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00677-6","20200721","Behavioral health; COVID; COVID-19; Community mental health; Community mental health and covid-19; Coronavirus; Mental and physical comorbidities and covid-19; Mental health; Psychiatry; Telehealth guidelines","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Identifying Moral Injury in Healthcare Professionals: The Moral Injury Symptom Scale-HP","ThisÂ study aims to develop and assess the psychometric properties of a measure of moral injury (MI) symptoms for identifying clinically significant MI in health professionals (HPs), one that might be useful in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. A total of 181 HPs (71% physicians) were recruited from Duke University Health Systems in Durham, North Carolina. Internal reliability of the Moral Injury Symptom Scale-Healthcare Professionals version (MISS-HP) was examined, along with factor analytic, discriminant, and convergent validity. A cutoff score was identified from a receiver operator curve (ROC) that best identified individuals with significant impairment in social or occupational functioning. The 10-item MISS-HP measuresÂ 10 theoretically grounded dimensions of MI assessing betrayal, guilt, shame, moral concerns, religious struggle, loss of religious/spiritual faith, loss of meaning/purpose, difficulty forgiving, loss of trust, and self-condemnation (score range 10-100). Internal reliability of the MISS-HP was 0.75. PCA identified three factors, which was confirmed by CFA, explaining 56.8% of the variance. Discriminant validity was demonstrated by modest correlations (r'sâ€‰=â€‰0.25-0.37) with low religiosity, depression, and anxiety symptoms, whereas convergent validity was evident by strong correlations with clinician burnout (râ€‰=â€‰0.57) and with another multi-item measure of MI symptoms (râ€‰=â€‰0.65). ROC characteristics indicated that a score of 36 or higher was 84% sensitive and 93% specific for identifying MI symptoms causing moderate to extreme problems with family, social, and occupational functioning. The MISS-HP is a reliable and valid measure of moral injury symptoms in health professionals that can be used in clinical practice to screen for MI and monitor response to treatment, as well as when conducting researchÂ that evaluates interventions to treat MI in HPs.","Mantri, Lawson, Wang, Koenig","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01065-w","20200721","Burnout; Depression; Health professionals; Internal conflict; Moral injury; Religiosity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A projection for psychiatry in the post-COVID-19 era: potential trends, challenges, and directions","The COVID-19 pandemic has transformed the face of psychiatry over a very short time period. Given the detrimental impact of the pandemic on mental health and the economy, more difficult days are ahead for psychiatry. The rising public health burden of mental illnesses will inevitably exceed the capacity of psychiatric services in the United States and worldwide. The pandemic has also profoundly affected psychiatric research due to safety concerns and containment efforts. Intermediate and long-term ramifications may even be more serious. In addition to the effects of the economic downturn on available research funding, existing research tools and protocols may not meet the emerging needs in the post-COVID-19 era. This paper discusses potential trends and challenges that psychiatric practice and research may encounter in this period from the viewpoint of workers in the field. We outline some measures that clinicians and researchers can implement to adapt to the emerging changes in psychiatry and to mitigate the forthcoming effects of the crisis.","TÃ¼rkÃ¶zer, Ã–ngÃ¼r","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-020-0841-2","20200721",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health and Cancer: Why It Is Time to Innovate and Integrate-A Call to Action","Surgical, radio-oncological, and medical anti-cancer therapies have developed at pace and scale in recent years, yet there remains a huge unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Recent experience in the COVID-19 pandemic has added to recognition of this unmet need. There needs to be more effective clinical integration of relevant services, which must be informed by patient choice and clinical need, and accessible throughout the patient's whole cancer journey. This needs to be accompanied by training and research integration as well as more effective and creative use of technology such as virtual reality and simulation, quality assuring apps, and mobile technologies. Finally, as a clinical community we need to drive a shift in culture towards measurement of patient quality of life as a marker of treatment effectiveness. We also need to support our own clinical workforce with their own mental health needs so that we prevent the alarming rates of burnout prevalent among clinicians treating cancer. The call to action for innovation and staff support has been amplified by experience in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENT SUMMARY: This report highlights the unmet need for mental health in cancer care. Patients need effective access to psychological support and mental health services throughout their cancer journey, including better use of technology. There is also a need to support the psychological wellbeing of cancer clinicians.","Fernando","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euf.2020.06.025","20200720","Burnout; COVID-19; Cancer; Innovation; Integration; Mental health; Psychiatry; Quality of life; Simulation; Technology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health status among family members of health care workers in Ningbo, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak: a cross-sectional study","To date, the psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic among family members of health care workers (HCWs) in China has been neglected. This cross-sectional study investigates the mental health status and related factors in families of HCWs employed in designated hospitals in Ningbo, China. Family members of HCWs in five designated hospitals in Ningbo, China, were recruited in February, 2020 for this study. Demographic variables, COVID-19-related events in the lives of the participants, knowledge of COVID-19, and the working status of family members (that is, HCWs) were collected using online self-administered questionnaires. Mental health status was assessed using the Chinese versions of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the main factors associated with the mental health conditions. In total, 845 participants completed the questionnaires correctly (95.80% response rate). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms were respectively 33.73% (95% CI: 30.53-36.92%) and 29.35% (95% CI: 26.27-32.43%) when a cut-off score of 5 was used for GAD-7 and PHQ-9. Risk factors for anxiety symptoms included more time (hours) spent thinking about the COVID-19, and whether or not family members (that is, HCWs) had direct contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients while high participants' self-reported safety scores for HCW's protective equipment was a protective factor. More time (hours) spent thinking about COVID-19, longer average working time per week worked by family members (that is, HCWs), and being parents and other next of kin of HCWs were risk factors for depressive symptoms. Compared to participants who were HCWs, participants who were private sector workers were more likely to develop depressive symptoms, while government or institutional employees were less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms. Psychological responses to COVID-19 have been dramatic among family members of HCWs during the rising phase of the outbreak. Our findings provide strong evidence to examine and attend to the mental health of this population during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Ying, Ruan, Kong, Zhu, Ji, Lou","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02784-w","20200721","Anxiety symptoms; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Depressive symptoms; Family members of health care workers; Mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The Early Food Insecurity Impacts of COVID-19","COVID-19 has disrupted food access and impacted food insecurity, which is associated with numerous adverse individual and public health outcomes. To assess these challenges and understand their impact on food security, we conducted a statewide population-level survey using a convenience sample in Vermont from March 29 to April 12, 2020, during the beginning of a statewide stay-at-home order. We utilized the United States Department of Agriculture six-item validated food security module to measure food insecurity before COVID-19 and since COVID-19. We assessed food insecurity prevalence and reported food access challenges, coping strategies, and perceived helpful interventions among food secure, consistently food insecure (pre-and post-COVID-19), and newly food insecure (post COVID-19) respondents. Among 3219 respondents, there was nearly a one-third increase (32.3%) in household food insecurity since COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with 35.5% of food insecure households classified as newly food insecure. Respondents experiencing a job loss were at higher odds of experiencing food insecurity (OR 3.06; 95% CI, 2.114-0.46). We report multiple physical and economic barriers, as well as concerns related to food access during COVID-19. Respondents experiencing household food insecurity had higher odds of facing access challenges and utilizing coping strategies, including two-thirds of households eating less since COVID-19 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Significant differences in coping strategies were documented between respondents in newly food insecure vs. consistently insecure households. These findings have important potential impacts on individual health, including mental health and malnutrition, as well as on future healthcare costs. We suggest proactive strategies to address food insecurity during this crisis.","Niles, Bertmann, Belarmino, Wentworth, Biehl, Neff","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12072096","20200720","COVID-19; coronavirus; employment; food access; food security; malnutrition","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Perceived Threat of COVID-19 Contagion and Frontline Paramedics' Agonistic Behaviour: Employing a Stressor-Strain-Outcome Perspective","Historically, infectious diseases have been the leading cause of human psychosomatic strain and death tolls. This research investigated the recent threat of COVID-19 contagion, especially its impact among frontline paramedics treating patients with COVID-19, and their perception of self-infection, which ultimately increases their agonistic behaviour. Based on the stressor-strain-outcome paradigm, a research model was proposed and investigated using survey-based data through a structured questionnaire. The results found that the perceived threat of COVID-19 contagion (emotional and cognitive threat) was positively correlated with physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion, which led toward agonistic behaviour. Further, perceived social support was a key moderator that negatively affected the relationships between agonistic behaviour and physiological anxiety, depression, and emotional exhaustion.

"Changes in alcohol use as a function of psychological distress and social support following COVID-19 related University closings","Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30Â days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.","Lechner, Laurene, Patel, Anderson, Grega, Kenne","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527","20200722","Alcohol use; Anxiety symptoms; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Social support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During The Covid-19 Pandemic In The Indian Subcontinent","The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to it. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, when compared to the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable rise in covid infections with its gradual relaxation continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on the same especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operation theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice all over the country. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. A total of 176 responses were received from all over the Indian Sub-Continent. The median age of respondents was 39years (range 32-70 yrs) and the post-residency experience was 7years (range 0-34 yrs). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. 46% of the respondents were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (p=0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services(26% vs 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N-95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practised precautionary measures in outpatient services(&gt;60%). While private practitioners were continuing elective cases(40%), public institutes were more cautious with only emergencies being operated(29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to the family (75%). Social media was helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats upon social media platforms(37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. The survey highlights the perception of the neurosurgeons towards the pandemic and the difference in public-private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of the regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal OPD/OR practices and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by PPE usage and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Though telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, yet online education has been favourably received.","Deora, Mishra, Tripathi, Garg, Tandon, Borkar, Varshney, Raut, Chaurasia, Chandra, Kale","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038","20200719","CORONAVIRUS; COVID-19; NEUROSURGERY; SOCIAL MEDIA","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

To determine the psychological status and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSD) among general population (except confirmed and suspected cases, and close contacts) and their association with the coping strategy types during the COVID-19 outbreak. A cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited from the community through snowball sampling with anonymous online questionnaires, using 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and 28-item Brief Coping Inventory (COPE) to measure their psychiatric disorders, PTSD level, and coping strategies. Of the total 1109 participants, 42.65% and 67.09% self-reported psychiatric disorders and high PTSD level, respectively. Age, occupation, and education level were significantly association with psychological status. The status of psychiatric disorders was also significantly related to high PTSD level. Using both emotion and problem coping was better for psychiatric status (aOR=0.72, 95% CI: 0.54-0.98) and problem-focused coping was significantly associated with high PTSD level (aOR=2.09, 95%CI: 1.25-3.51).

"A Mixed-method Study of Individual, Couple and Parental Functioning During the State-regulated COVID-19 Lockdown in Spain","During the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Spain we explored the individual and relational wellbeing of people confined together with their partners and/or children during the first three weeks of state-regulated lockdown. Adults 18 years or older (N=407) completed an online survey that included demographic, household, and employment information along with standardized measures of psychological distress (State-Trait Anxiety, Beck Depression) and relationship functioning - either the Dyadic Adjustment Scale if there were no children in the household or a Basic Family Relations Evaluation Questionnaire (CERFB) measuring conjugal, parental, and co-parental functions. Qualitative analyses of responses to an open-ended question about perceived changes in couple or family dynamics during lockdown revealed 9 specific themes comprising two overarching categories: relational improvement and deterioration. The overall prevalence of improvement themes (61.7%) exceeded deterioration themes (41.0%), with increased (re)connection and conflict atmosphere cited most often. Quantitative analyses found elevated levels of state anxiety but not trait anxiety or depression during lockdown. Consistent with the qualitative results, couples having no children at home reported high levels of dyadic adjustment, but with children present CERFB parental functioning exceeded conjugal functioning, a pattern sometimes associated with child triangulation into adult conflicts. Although correlates of psychological distress (e.g., unemployment, perceived economic risk) were relatively stable across sub-groups, predictors of relationship functioning varied substantially with household/parental status (e.g., telecommuting and employment facilitated conjugal functioning only for couples with children).","GÃ¼nther-Bel, Vilaregut, Carratala, Torras-Garat, PÃ©rez-Testor","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12585","20200717",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health of orthopaedic trauma patients during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic","The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has been associated with reports of increased anxiety, depression and fear among the general population. People with underlying psychiatric disorders are more susceptible to stress than the general population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of concomitant psychiatric conditions in the orthopaedic trauma population during the COVID-19 pandemic. This retrospective cohort study evaluated orthopaedic trauma patients who received care at our institution between February through April of 2019 and February through April of 2020. Patient sex, age, mechanism of injury, associated injuries, fracture location, tobacco use, employment status, mental health diagnosis and presence of interpersonal violence were documented. Mental health diagnoses were defined based on International Classification of Diseases-10 classification. The study included 553 orthopaedic patients evaluated at our institution during the defined time period. Patients in the 2020 cohort had a higher prevalence of mental health diagnoses (26% vs. 43%, pÂ &lt;â€‰0.0001) compared with the 2019 group. The odds ratio for mental health disorder in the 2020 patients was 2.21 (95% CI 1.54, 3.18) compared with the 2019 cohort. The 2020 cohort had a higher percentage of patients who reported interpersonal violence (20% vs. 11%, pÂ =â€‰0.005). Our study showed a higher prevalence of psychiatric disease among orthopaedic trauma patients during the COVID-19 pandemic when compared with those seen during the same time of the year in 2019. Stress induced by the coronavirus pandemic can place patients with mental illness at a higher risk for perilous behaviours and subsequent fractures.","Ohliger, Umpierrez, Buehler, Ohliger, Magister, Vallier, Hirschfeld","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04711-w","20200720","COVID-19; Interpersonal violence; Mental health; Orthopaedic trauma","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychosocial and Socio-Economic Crisis in Bangladesh Due to COVID-19 Pandemic: A Perception-Based Assessment","<b>Background:</b> The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the partial lockdown, the disease intensity, weak governance in the healthcare system, insufficient medical facilities, unawareness, and the sharing of misinformation in the mass media has led to people experiencing fear and anxiety. The present study intended to conduct a perception-based analysis to get an idea of people's psychosocial and socio-economic crisis, and the possible environmental crisis, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A perception-based questionnaire was put online for Bangladeshi citizens of 18 years and/or older. The sample size was 1,066 respondents. Datasets were analyzed through a set of statistical techniques including principal component and hierarchical cluster analysis. <b>Results:</b> There was a positive significant association between fear of the COVID-19 outbreak with the struggling healthcare system (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) of the country. Also, there was a negative association between the fragile health system of Bangladesh and the government's ability to deal with the pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), revealing the poor governance in the healthcare system. A positive association of shutdown and social distancing with the fear of losing one's own or a family members' life, influenced by a lack of healthcare treatment (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), reveals that, due to the decision of shutting down normal activities, people may be experiencing mental and economic stress. However, a positive association of the socio-economic impact of the shutdown with poor people's suffering, the price hike of basic essentials, the hindering of formal education (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), and the possibility of a severe socio-economic and health crisis will be aggravated. Moreover, there is a possibility of a climate change-induced disaster and infectious diseases like dengue during/after the COVID-19 situation, which will create severe food insecurity (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and a further healthcare crisis. <b>Conclusions:</b> The partial lockdown in Bangladesh due to the COVID-19 pandemic increased community transmission and worsened the healthcare crisis, economic burden, and loss of GDP despite the resuming of industrial operations. In society, it has created psychosocial and socio-economic insecurity among people due to the loss of lives and livelihoods. The government should take proper inclusive steps for risk assessment, communications, and financial stimulus toward the public to alleviate their fear and anxiety, and to take proper action to boost mental health and well-being.","Bodrud-Doza, Shammi, Bahlman, Islam, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00341","20200718","COVID-19; fear; linear regression model; perception-based questionnaire; principal component analysis (PCA); social conflict","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Exploring the challenges faced by frontline workers in health and social care amid the COVID-19 pandemic: experiences of frontline workers in the English Midlands region, UK","The first cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19) were reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. Globally millions of people have been diagnosed with the virus whilst thousands have died. As the virus kept spreading health and social care frontline workers (HSCFW) were faced with difficulties when discharging their duties. This paper was set out to explore the challenges faced by different frontline workers in health and social care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The research utilized an explorative qualitative approach. A total of forty (NÂ =Â 40) in-depth one-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with HSCFW who included support workers (nÂ =Â 15), nurses (nÂ =Â 15), and managers (NÂ =Â 10). Health and social care workers were drawn from domiciliary care and care homes (with and without nursing services). All the interviews were done online. The data were thematically analyzed, and the emergent themes were supported by quotes from the interviews held with participants. Following data analysis the research study found that lack of pandemic preparedness, <b>s</b>hortage of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), anxiety and fear amongst professionals, challenges in enforcing social distancing, challenges in fulfilling social shielding responsibility, anxiety and fear amongst residents and service users, delay in testing, evolving PPE guidance and shortage of staff were challenges faced by frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results of the current study point to a need for adequate pandemic preparedness within the health and social care sector to protect both frontline workers and the individuals they look after.","Nyashanu, Pfende, Ekpenyong","https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1792425","20200717","COVID-19; UK; front-line workers; mental health; pandemic; shortage","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A Mixed-Methods Pilot Study of Perinatal Risk and Resilience During COVID-19","<b>Introduction/Objectives:</b> National guidelines underscore the need for improvement in the detection and treatment of mood disorders in the perinatal period. Exposure to disasters can amplify perinatal mood disorders and even have intergenerational impacts. The primary aim of this pilot study was to use mixed-methods to better understand the mental health and well-being effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as sources of resilience, among women during the perinatal period. <b>Methods:</b> The study team used a simultaneous exploratory mixed-methods design to investigate the primary objective. Thirty-one pregnant and postpartum women participated in phone interviews and were invited to complete an online survey which included validated mental health and well-being measures. <b>Results:</b> Approximately 12% of the sample reported high depressive symptomatology and 60% reported moderate or severe anxiety. Forty percent of the sample reported being lonely. The primary themes related to stress were uncertainty surrounding perinatal care, exposure risk for both mother and baby, inconsistent messaging from information sources and lack of support networks. Participants identified various sources of resilience, including the use of virtual communication platforms, engaging in self-care behaviors (eg, adequate sleep, physical activity, and healthy eating), partner emotional support, being outdoors, gratitude, and adhering to structures and routines. <b>Conclusions:</b> Since the onset of COVID-19, many pregnant and postpartum women report struggling with stress, depression, and anxiety symptomatology. Findings from this pilot study begin to inform future intervention work to best support this highly vulnerable population.","Farewell, Jewell, Walls, Leiferman","https://doi.org/10.1177/2150132720944074","20200721","disasters; mood disorders; perinatal mental health; postpartum care; prenatal care; Adult; Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pilot Projects; Pneumonia, Viral; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Qualitative Research; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Assessment; Stress, Psychological; United States; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How to prevent in-hospital COVID-19 infection and reassure women about the safety of pregnancy: Experience from an obstetric center in China","This study aimed to describe the emergency responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) for pregnant patients at our hospital and their effect on hospital operations and patients' outcomes. We developed strategies to prevent hospital-associated transmission of COVID-19 in obstetric care. Infrastructure, including the fever clinic and wards, were modified. Outpatient volume was controlled and screening processes were strictly performed. Verification of the virus was compulsory for non-surgery and non-emergency patients. Emergency operations were performed in a negative pressure theater with surgeons fully protected. Outcomes were analyzed and the patients' characteristics were evaluated. The effect of intervention on depressed and anxious patients was assessed. Data from the first 2 months of 2019 and 2020 were compared. No in-hospital COVID-19 infections occurred in our unit. During the epidemic, patient volume significantly decreased. While major characteristics of patients were similar, a higher prevalence of gestational hypertension was found in 2020 than in 2019. Psychological interventions showed optimistic effects in ameliorating depression and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our strategies were effective in preventing in-hospital infection of COVID-19 and reassuring women about the safety of pregnancy. Monitoring and managing psychological issues were necessary during this critical period.","Gu, Chen, Yu, Liang, Chen, Shen","https://doi.org/10.1177/0300060520939337","20200717","Coronavirus disease 2019; depression; hospital-acquired infection; pregnancy outcome; psychological stability; telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Quality of sleep and health-related quality of life among health care professionals treating patients with coronavirus disease-19","Health care professionals exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are facing high levels of stress. The aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep (QoS) and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), among health care professionals treating patients with COVID-19, as well as quantifying the magnitude of symptoms of depression and levels of anxiety. We included 201 health care professionals in a cross-sectional, web-based study by applying 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale, Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, 36-item Health Survey of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF36), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and additional survey constructed for the purpose of the study. Health care workers who treated COVID-19 patients were more afraid of becoming infected or of transmitting the infection to a family member with a significantly low self-assessment of their mental status. Poor QoS and HRQoL correlated with high health anxiety and severe depressive symptoms and several demographic characteristics. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that higher scores on GAD-7 (betaâ€‰=â€‰.71, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01) and lower scores on mental health (MH) subscale on SF36 questionnaire (betaâ€‰=â€‰-.69; <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01) were independent predictors of the higher PSQI score (adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>â€‰=â€‰.61, <i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.01 for overall model).

"Mental Health and Work Attitudes among People Resuming Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in China","The unprecedented outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused an economic downturn and increased the unemployment rate in China. In this context, employees face health and social economic stressors. To assess their mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization) and work attitudes (i.e., work engagement, job satisfaction and turnover intention) as well as the associated factors, we conducted a cross-sectional study among people who resumed work after the Spring Festival holiday during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results show that the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and somatization among these people was 12.7%, 13.5%, 20.7% and 6.6%, respectively. The major risk factor for mental health was worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were psychological strengths (i.e., resilience and optimism). Regarding work attitudes, the percentage of people who felt more satisfied with their job (43.8%) was larger than that of those who felt less satisfied (26.9%), while the percentage of people who thought about quitting their job more frequently (15.7%) was smaller than that of those who considered it less frequently (63.2%). However, work engagement was lower than usual. Similar to the factors associated with mental health, the major risk factor for work attitudes was also worrying about unemployment, and the main protective factors were resilience and optimism. In addition, the nature of the organization, job status, age, position and income changes were also related to these work attitudes. Our findings shed light on the need for organization administrators to be aware of the status of and factors associated with employees' mental health and work attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policies or interventions could be developed based on our findings.","Song, Wang, Li, Yang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145059","20200720","COVID-19; employees; job satisfaction; mental health; resume work; turnover intention; work attitudes; work engagement","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Social Distancing among Medical Students during the 2019 Coronavirus Disease Pandemic in China: Disease Awareness, Anxiety Disorder, Depression, and Behavioral Activities","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, harsh social distancing measures were taken in China to contain viral spread. We examined their impact on the lives of medical students. A nation-wide cross-sectional survey of college students was conducted from 4-12 February 2020. We enrolled medical students studying public health in Beijing and Wuhan to assess their COVID-19 awareness and to evaluate their mental health status/behaviors using a self-administered questionnaire. We used the Patient Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Health Questionnaire-9 to measure anxiety disorders and depression. We used multivariable logistic regression and path analysis to assess the associations between covariates and anxiety disorder/depression. Of 933 students, 898 (96.2%) reported wearing masks frequently when going out, 723 (77.5%) reported daily handwashing with soap, 676 (72.5%) washed hands immediately after arriving home, and 914 (98.0%) reported staying home as much as possible. Prevalence of anxiety disorder was 17.1% and depression was 25.3%. Multivariable logistic regression showed anxiety to be associated with graduate student status (odds ratio (aOR) = 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-3.5), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.6; 95% CI: 1.4-1.7), and feeling depressed (aOR = 6.8; 95% CI: 4.0-11.7). Beijing students were significantly less likely to have anxiety than those in the Wuhan epicenter (aOR = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.8-1.0), but depression did not differ. Depression was associated with female students (aOR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2-3.3), negative thoughts or actions (aOR = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.5-1.9), and anxiety disorder (aOR = 5.8; 95% CI: 3.4-9.9). Path analysis validated these same predictors. Despite medical students' knowledge of disease control and prevention, their lives were greatly affected by social distancing, especially in the Wuhan epicenter. Even well-informed students needed psychological support during these extraordinarily stressful times.","Xiao, Shu, Li, Li, Tao, Wu, Yu, Meng, Vermund, Hu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17145047","20200720","COVID-19; China; anxiety disorder; depression; knowledge; medical students; personal protective measures; social distancing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mapping population mental health concerns related to COVID-19 and the consequences of physical distancing: a Google trends analysis","<b>Background:</b> The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Â Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown.Â <b>Methods:</b> We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - Â 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people's concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. <b>Results:</b> Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. <b>Conclusions:</b> Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Evans, Marchant, Gunnell, John","https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2","20200717","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Economic; Mental health; Pandemic; Suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The ups and downs of daily life during COVID-19: Age differences in affect, stress, and positive events","Past research has linked older age with greater emotional well-being and decreased reactivity to stressors, but it is unknown whether age-related advantages in emotional well-being are maintained in the wake of COVID-19. We examined age differences in exposure and affective reactivity to daily stressors and positive events in the first several weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak. In March and April 2020, 776 adults from Canada and the U.S. ages 18-91 (mean age 45) reported COVID-19 threats at baseline, then completed nightly surveys for one week about their daily stressors, positive events, and affect. Younger age predicted more concerns about the threat of COVID-19 across multiple domains, in addition to lower positive affect, higher negative affect, and less frequent positive events. Younger adults had more non-COVID-19 daily stressors and higher perceived control over stressors, but lower perceived coping efficacy than older adults. There were no age differences in the frequency of COVID-19 daily stressors nor perceived stressor severity. Younger adults had greater reductions in negative affect on days when more positive events occurred and greater increases in negative affect on days when non-COVID-19 stressors occurred. Age moderation was attenuated for negative affective reactivity to COVID-19 stressors. Age did not moderate positive affective reactivity to daily events. In the early weeks of the pandemic, older adults showed better emotional well-being and less reactivity to stressors but did not differ from younger adults in their exposure to COVID-19 stressors. Additionally, younger adults benefited more from positive events.","Klaiber, Wen, DeLongis, Sin","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa096","20200716","aging; coronavirus; daily stress; emotions; pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Do pre-existing anxiety-related and mood disorders differentially impact COVID-19 stress responses and coping?","People with pre-existing mental health conditions may be more susceptible to stressors associated with COVID-19 relative to the general population; however, no studies have assessed whether susceptibility differs between classes of mental health disorders. We assessed COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stressors, and coping in those with a primary anxiety-related disorder diagnosis, a primary mood disorder diagnosis, and no mental health disorder. Adults from a population-representative sample from the United States and Canada who reported current (past year) anxiety-related (n = 700) or mood (n = 368) disorders were compared to a random sample of respondents who did not report a current mental health diagnosis (n = 500) on COVID-19-related stress, self-isolation stress, and coping. The anxiety-related disorders group exhibited higher COVID Stress Scales total scores and higher scores on its fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms scales than the other groups. The mood disorders group had higher scores on the traumatic stress symptoms and socioeconomic consequences scales than those with no current mental disorder. Those with current anxiety-related or mood disorders were more likely to voluntarily self-isolate and were more likely to report greater self-isolation stressors and distress than those without a mental health disorder. Yet, there were no major differences in perceived effectiveness of coping strategies across groups. People with anxiety-related or mood disorders were more negatively affected by COVID-19 compared to those with no mental health disorder; however, adding to psychological burden, those with anxiety-related disorders reported greater fears about danger and contamination, socioeconomic consequences, xenophobia, and traumatic stress symptoms than the other groups. These findings suggest the need for tailoring COVID-19-related mental health interventions to meet the specific needs of people with pre-existing mental health conditions.","Asmundson, Paluszek, Landry, Rachor, McKay, Taylor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102271","20200720","Anxiety-related disorders; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Mental health; Mood disorders; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 severity, self-efficacy, knowledge, preventive behaviors, and mental health in Turkey","This study tested whether the levels of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) severity, self-efficacy, knowledge, and preventive behaviors predicted mental health. Participants were 3190 Turkish adults (50% women; <i>M</i> age = 38.76, SD = 10.43Â years) who completed online self-reported questionnaires. Most participants (55.11-64.42%) had inadequate knowledge about COVID-19 and were highly engaged in preventive behaviors. COVID-19-related severity, self-efficacy, and preventive behaviors correlated with mental health.

"Negative cognitive and psychological correlates of mandatory quarantine during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China","Quarantine plays a key role in controlling the pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study investigated (a) the associations between mandatory quarantine status and negative cognitions (perceived discrimination because of COVID-19 and perceived risk of COVID-19 infection)/mental health status (emotional distress because of COVID-19, probable depression, and self-harm/suicidal ideation), (b) the associations between the negative cognitions and mental health status, and (c) potential mediations between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 24,378 students of 26 universities in 16 Chinese cities (February 1-10, 2020). Correlation coefficients, odds ratios (OR), structural equation modeling, and other statistics were used for data analysis. Mandatory quarantined status was significantly and positively associated with perceived discrimination (Cohen's d = 0.62), perceived high/very high risk of infection (OR = 1.61), emotional distress (Cohen's d = 0.46), probable depression (OR = 2.54), and self-harm/suicidal ideation (OR = 4.98). Perceived discrimination was moderately and positively associated with emotional distress (Spearman correlation = 0.44). Associations between perceived risk of infection and mental health variables were significant but relatively weak. Cross-sectional mediation models showed good model fit, but the overall indirect paths via COVID-19-related negative cognitions/emotional distress only accounted for 12-15% of the total effects between quarantined status and probable depression and self-harm/suicidal ideation. In conclusion, quarantined participants were more likely than others to perceive discrimination and exhibit mental distress. It is important to integrate mental health care into the planning and implementation of quarantine measures. Future longitudinal studies to explore mechanisms underlying the mental health impact of quarantines are warranted.

"COVID-19 and ageism: How positive and negative responses impact older adults and society","The disproportionately high rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health complications and mortality among older adults prompted supportive public responses, such as special senior early shopping hours and penpal programs. Simultaneously, some older adults faced neglect and blatant displays of ageism (e.g., #BoomerRemover) and were considered the lowest priority to receive health care. This article examines positive and negative responses toward older adults in the United States during the pandemic and the consequences for older adults and society using data from the pandemic in the United States (and informed by data from other countries) as well as past theorizing and empirical research on views and treatment of older adults. Specifically, positive responses can reinforce the value of older adults, improve older adults' mental and physical health, reduce ageism, and improve intergenerational relations, whereas negative responses can have the opposite effects. However, positive responses (social distancing to protect older adults from COVID-19 infection) can inadvertently increase loneliness, depression, health problems, and negative stereotyping of older adults (e.g., helpless, weak). Pressing policy issues evident from the treatment of older adults during the pandemic include health care (triaging, elder abuse), employment (layoffs, retirement), and education about ageism, as well as the intersection of ageism with other forms of prejudice (e.g., racism) that cuts across these policies.

"Exercise and screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic","The objective of this paper is to describe the exercise and changes in screen time habits, and their relationship with health, among participants of the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (CPSS). Between March 29th and April 3rd 2020, CPSS participants (n = 4,524) reported whether they were exercising outdoors or indoors and whether they increased, decreased or maintained their TV, Internet and video game use. Participants also reported their self-perceived general and mental health. More women reported very good or excellent mental health if they were exercising outdoors (54%) compared with those who were not (41%). More women reported very good or excellent general health if they were exercising outdoors (75%) compared with those who were not (49%), with the same trend evident for those exercising indoors (69%) compared to those who were not (62%). More men (65%) and women (62%) rated their mental and general health as very good or excellent if they maintained or decreased TV time compared with those who increased TV time (57% and 43%, respectively), with the same evident for Internet use in women only (maintained/decreased: 61% versus increased: 44%). More men (63%) and women (52%) rated their mental health as very good or excellent if they maintained or decreased video game time compared with those who increased video game time (48% and 29%, respectively). More men and women reported very good or excellent mental and general health if they increased none or one type of screen and/or were exercising outdoors compared with those who increased 2 or 3 types of screens and who were not exercising outdoors, with the exception of general health among men. Maintaining opportunities for outdoor exercise and limiting screen time may promote better mental and general health during periods of confinement.","Colley, Bushnik, Langlois","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000600001-eng","20200723","coronavirus; mental health; physical activity; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Screen Time","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Factors contributing to the distress, concerns, and needs of UK Neuroscience health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 research from China suggests health care workers are at risk of distress, have specific concerns, and need support. It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: 'risk of infection', 'work challenges', and 'social change', and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID-19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID-19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a high incidence of psychological distress in UK health care staff. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued are influenced by individual staff characteristics. Stratified, one-to-one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches for stress reduction and resilience, are crucial.","Cipolotti, Chan, Murphy, van Harskamp, Foley","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12298","20200716","COVID-19; Pandemic; clinical neuropsychology; distress; health care workforce; psychological well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"How Have COVID-19 Isolation Policies Affected Young People's Mental Health? - Evidence From Chinese College Students","The breakout of COVID-19 has brought about huge influence on people's physic and mental health. This paper aims to investigate the mental health status of young people living in isolation due to the policy response to Coronavirus disease. Nine hundred ninety-two Chinese college students (<i>M</i>age = 19.45, <i>SD</i> = 1.41) were recruited to finish an online survey in the period of self-isolation. Seven dimensions of psychological well-being were measured, including mental status, knowledge of stress management, behavioral patterns, risk perception, academic stress, family relationships, and peer relationships. Results of cluster analysis indicated that young individuals' mental status can be divided into three groups: high-risk (<i>n</i> = 61, <i>M</i>age = 19.26, <i>SD</i> = 1.32), medium-risk (<i>n</i> = 627, <i>M</i>age = 19.43, <i>SD</i> = 1.38), and low-risk (<i>n</i> = 304, <i>M</i>age = 19.54, <i>SD</i> = 1.49). Moreover, results of multiple regression showed that the isolation policy has had a complex influence on the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 44.894, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], fear [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 30.776, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], hypochondria [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 22.530, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], depression [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 39.022, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001], and neurasthenia [<i>F</i>(12, 979) = 45.735, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001] via various factors.

"Psychological Support System for Hospital Workers During the Covid-19 Outbreak: Rapid Design and Implementation of the Covid-Psy Hotline","The worldwide coronavirus outbreak has put hospital workers under extreme stress with possible mental health problems. In this context, we decided to rapidly design and implement a psychological support system for all hospital workers in Paris during the Covid-19 outbreak. We built a hotline in 3 days using the following steps: 1) official mandate, 2) request for the creation of hotline numbers, 3) formulation of psychological intervention materials and policies, 4) call for volunteer certified psychologists, 5) call for volunteer certified psychiatrists in case of psychiatric cases, 6) creation of an anonymous and protected database, and 7) communication and regular reminders about the existence of the hotline for hospital workers. After the first 26 days, we received 149 calls with a mean of 5.73 calls/day (SD=3.22). The average call duration was 18.5 min (min=1; max=65min; SD=14.7), and mostly women (86%) called. The mean age was 32.7 years old (SD=11.0). Calls from hospital workers were from all professions; though mostly represented by frontline healthcare workers, non-frontline departments also called (total of 44 departments). Reasons for calling were anxiety symptoms (n=73, 49%), request for hotline information (n=31, 20.8%), worries about Covid-19 (n=23, 15.44%), exhaustion (n=17, 11.41%), trauma reactivation (n=10, 6.11%), insomnia (n=9, 6.0%), anger (n=8, 5.37%), depressive (n=6, 4.02%), and psychotic symptoms (n=3, 2.01%). Regarding referrals, 105 (70.47%) of them were referred to psychosocial, Covid, and general support. This psychological support system can be easily duplicated and seems to benefit all hospital professions that all appeared psychologically affected.","Geoffroy, Le Goanvic, Sabbagh, Richoux, Weinstein, Dufayet, Lejoyeux","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00511","20200717","healthcare workers; medical workers; mental health; psychiatry; psychological intervention; psychology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Addressing the Problem of Severe Underinvestment in Mental Health and Well-Being from a Human Rights Perspective","Throughout the world, mental health remains a neglected priority, low on the agenda of policy makers and funders at the national and international levels. While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions-which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience-there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to &quot;scale up&quot; mental health and to reduce &quot;treatment gaps&quot; are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed","https://www.google.com/search?q=Addressing+the+Problem+of+Severe+Underinvestment+in+Mental+Health+and+Well-Being+from+a+Human+Rights+Perspective.","20200717",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"An Integrated Blueprint for Digital Mental Health Services Amidst COVID-19","In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing difficulties amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. The recent implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, De Leo","https://doi.org/10.2196/21718","20200724","COVID-19; automation; digital mental health; machine learning; mental well-being online assessments; well-being services","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Using an online survey platform, a poststratified (by age, gender, race, income, and geography), representative sample (nâ€‰=â€‰10,368 adults) is used in the analysis. On average, sample respondents report Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale symptomatology nearly a point higher than the often used cutoff score for clinical caseness (16+); one-third of respondents had CES-D scores higher than 25. Multiple regression results show elevated levels of depressive symptomatology among the socially vulnerable (women, Hispanic, unmarried, not working). Those persons expressing heightened COVID-19 fear and moderate to high levels of food insecurity report more depressive symptoms than persons with less fear and low or no food insecurity. All three of the resource variables (mastery of fate, strength of ties, and optimism) are significant and in the negative direction. In a snapshot, the data provide an important point prevalence assessment of adult depressive symptoms during the current public health crisis.

"COVID-19 Outbreak and Management Approach for Families with Children on Long-Term Kidney Replacement Therapy","During the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, the treatment of families with children on long-term KRT is challenging. This study was conducted to identify the current difficulties, worries regarding the next 2 months, and mental distress experienced by families with children on long-term KRT during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak and to deliver possible management approaches to ensure uninterrupted treatment for children on long-term KRT. A multicenter online survey was conducted between February 10 and 15, 2020, among the families with children on long-term KRT from five major pediatric dialysis centers in mainland China. The primary caregivers of children currently on long-term KRT were eligible and included. Demographic information, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection status, current difficulties, and worries regarding the next 2 months were surveyed using a self-developed questionnaire. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the General Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 were used to screen for depressive symptoms and anxiety, respectively. Among the children in the 220 families included in data analysis, 113 (51%) children were on dialysis, and the other 107 (49%) had kidney transplants. No families reported confirmed or suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019. Overall, 135 (61%) and 173 (79%) caregivers reported having difficulties now and having worries regarding the next 2 months, respectively. Dialysis supply shortage (dialysis group) and hard to have blood tests (kidney transplantation group) were most commonly reported. A total of 29 (13%) caregivers had depressive symptoms, and 24 (11%) had anxiety. After the survey, we offered online and offline interventions to address their problems.

"Breath Regulation and yogic Exercise An online Therapy for calm and Happiness (BREATH) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial","Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions. HEP will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules with psychoeducation on healthy active living as well as interactive modules comprising of guided de-stressing exercises including music therapy, mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation. Weekly follow up sessions will be offered to all recruited participants for 30 minutes each for the subsequent 4 weeks in both study arms. The following feasibility outcomes will be measured at the end of the study: (1) rate of participant recruitment, (2) rate of retention, (3) completeness of data entry, (4) cost of interventions, and (5) unexpected costs. Such measures will be collected on a daily basis through-out the study and tabulated 5 weeks later at the end of the study. Participants will be randomized after they have electronically signed the consent form and the research staff have confirmed eligibility. We will use REDCap to perform randomization in a 1:1 ratio as well as allocation concealment. REDCap is widely used by health researchers worldwide to significantly reduce data entry and study management errors to improve data fidelity. All study participants will be blinded to the study hypotheses so as to prevent any expectation bias. Group allocation will be masked during analysis. This study will randomize a total of 60 participants in a 1:1 ratio to either SKY or HEP interventions. Protocol version number 2.0 (June 5, 2020). Recruitment is currently ongoing (starting June 25, 2020). We anticipate to complete recruitment by June 30, 2021 and complete the study by September 30, 2021.

"Modeling Spatiotemporal Pattern of Depressive Symptoms Caused by COVID-19 Using Social Media Data Mining","By 29 May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had spread to 188 countries, infecting more than 5.9 million people, and causing 361,249 deaths. Governments issued travel restrictions, gatherings of institutions were cancelled, and citizens were ordered to socially distance themselves in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Fear of being infected by the virus and panic over job losses and missed education opportunities have increased people's stress levels. Psychological studies using traditional surveys are time-consuming and contain cognitive and sampling biases, and therefore cannot be used to build large datasets for a real-time depression analysis. In this article, we propose a CorExQ9 algorithm that integrates a Correlation Explanation (CorEx) learning algorithm and clinical Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) lexicon to detect COVID-19 related stress symptoms at a spatiotemporal scale in the United States. The proposed algorithm overcomes the common limitations of traditional topic detection models and minimizes the ambiguity that is caused by human interventions in social media data mining. The results show a strong correlation between stress symptoms and the number of increased COVID-19 cases for major U.S. cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Miami. The results also show that people's risk perception is sensitive to the release of COVID-19 related public news and media messages. Between January and March, fear of infection and unpredictability of the virus caused widespread panic and people began stockpiling supplies, but later in April, concerns shifted as financial worries in western and eastern coastal areas of the U.S. left people uncertain of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives.","Li, Chaudhary, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144988","20200720","Basilisk algorithm; COVID-19 pandemic; Correlation Explanation (CorEx); Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ); mental health; social media data mining; Algorithms; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Depression; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uncertainty; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Treatment Delays in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) and its associated restrictions could affect ischemic times in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of the COVID-19 outbreak on ischemic times in consecutive all-comer STEMI patients. We included consecutive STEMI patients (<i>n</i> = 163, median age: 61 years, 27% women) who were referred to seven tertiary care hospitals across Austria for primary percutaneous coronary intervention between 24 February 2020 (calendar week 9) and 5 April 2020 (calendar week 14). The number of patients, total ischemic times and door-to-balloon times in temporal relation to COVID-19-related restrictions and infection rates were analyzed. While rates of STEMI admissions decreased (calendar week 9/10 (<i>n</i> = 69, 42%); calendar week 11/12 (<i>n</i> = 51, 31%); calendar week 13/14 (<i>n</i> = 43, 26%)), total ischemic times increased from 164 (interquartile range (IQR): 107-281) min (calendar week 9/10) to 237 (IQR: 141-560) min (calendar week 11/12) and to 275 (IQR: 170-590) min (calendar week 13/14) (<i>p</i> = 0.006). Door-to-balloon times were constant (<i>p</i> = 0.60). There was a significant difference in post-interventional Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 3 in patients treated during calendar week 9/10 (97%), 11/12 (84%) and 13/14 (81%; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Rates of in-hospital death and re-infarction were similar between groups (<i>p</i> = 0.48). Results were comparable when dichotomizing data on 10 March and 16 March 2020, when official restrictions were executed. In this cohort of all-comer STEMI patients, we observed a 1.7-fold increase in ischemic time during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Austria. Patient-related factors likely explain most of this increase. Counteractive steps are needed to prevent further cardiac collateral damage during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Reinstadler, Reindl, Lechner, Holzknecht, Tiller, Roithinger, Frick, Hoppe, Jirak, Berger, Delle-Karth, LaÃŸnig, Klug, Bauer, Binder, Metzler","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072183","20200715","Coronavirus disease 2019; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; total ischemic time","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.","Elhai, Yang, McKay, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.080","20200717","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemics; Smartphone addiction","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation","Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.","Xiao, Zhu, Fu, Hu, Li, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.081","20200717","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health care workers; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry","The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25-50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.","Anmella, Arbelo, Fico, Murru, Llach, Madero, Gomes-da-Costa, Imaz, LÃ³pez-Pelayo, Vieta, Pintor","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149","20200716","COVID-19; Consultation liaison psychiatry; Interactions; Psychiatry; Psychodrug; Psychopharmacology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Expanding Possibilities: Flexibility and Solidarity with Under Resourced Immigrant Families During the Covid-19 Pandemic","The novel coronavirus has added new anxieties and forms of grieving to the myriad practical and emotional burdens already present in the lives of underserved and uninsured immigrant families and communities. In this article, we relate our experiences since the Covid-19 crisis to the lessons we have learned over time as mental health professionals working with families in no-cost, student-managed community comprehensive health clinics in academic-community partnerships. We compare and contrast the learnings of flexibility of time, space, procedures or attendance we acquired in this clinical community setting during regular times, with the new challenges families and therapists face, and the adaptations needed to continue to work with our clients in culturally responsive and empowering ways during the Covid-19 pandemic. We describe families, students, professionals, promotoras (community links) and IT support staff joining together in solidarity as the creative problem solvers of new possibilities when families do not have access to Wifi, smart phones or computers, or suffer overcrowding and lack of privacy. We describe many anxieties related to economic insecurity or fear of facing death alone, but also how to visualize expanding possibilities in styles of parenting or types of emotional support among family members as elements of hope that may endure beyond these unprecedented tragic times of loss and uncertainty.","Falicov, NiÃ±o, D'Urso","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12578","20200714","Community Clinic; Covid-19 Impact; Health Disparities; Immigrants; Latinx; Telehealth; Under Resourced","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Anxiety and depression and its correlates in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 in Wuhan","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke-out in Wuhan China in December 2019, and spread throughout the entire country within a short time. This cross-sectional study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety and associated risk factors were analysed in patients with COVID-19. This single-center cross-sectional study focussed on measuring depression and anxiety using self-report scales. Linear regression was used to determine independent predictors for depression and anxiety. A total of 78 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 were enrolled in the study. Prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms were diagnosed in 35.9% and 38.5% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate linear regression analysis found female gender was an independent predictor for higher depression severity index. Having family members who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and family members who died from COVID-19 were independently associated with higher depression severity index and anxiety score. Patients with COVID-19 especially those who had family members diagnosed with COVID-19 or died from COVID-19 were more susceptible to depression and anxiety than were other patients. Effective strategies should be pursued to improve the mental health of this patient population. Key points Patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly high prevalence of depression and anxiety. Female patients were associated with higher risk of depression. Patients with family members diagnosed as COVID-19 or died from this disease were associated with higher risk of depression and anxiety.","Nie, Wang, Wang, Zhao, Liu, Zhu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/13651501.2020.1791345","20200714","COVID-19; Depression; anxiety","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This study examines youth mental health and substance use during the pandemic period. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 622 youth participants across existing clinical and community cohorts. Using the National Institute of Mental Health-developed CRISIS tool and other measures, participants reported on the impacts of COVID-19 on their mental health, substance use, and other constructs. Reports of prepandemic mental health compared to intrapandemic mental health show a statistically significant deterioration of mental health across clinical and community samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), with greater deterioration in the community sample. A total of 68.4% of youth in the clinical sample and 39.9% in the community sample met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder. Substance use declined in both clinical and community samples (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), although 23.2% of youth in the clinical sample and 3.0% in the community sample met screening criteria for a substance use disorder. Participants across samples report substantial mental health service disruptions (48.7% and 10.8%) and unmet support needs (44.1% and 16.2%). Participants report some positive impacts, are using a variety of coping strategies to manage their wellness, and shared a variety of ideas of strategies to support youth during the pandemic. Among youth with histories of mental health concerns, the pandemic context poses a significant risk for exacerbation of need. In addition, youth may experience the onset of new difficulties. We call on service planners to attend to youth mental health during COVID-19 by bolstering the accessibility of services.

"Support Groups and Individual Mental Health Care via Video Conferencing for Frontline Clinicians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has put an enormous stress on the mental health of frontline health care workers. Psychiatry departments in medical centers need to develop support systems to help our colleagues cope with this stress. We developed recurring peer support groups via videoconferencing and telephone for physicians, resident physicians, and nursing staff, focusing on issues and emotions related to their frontline clinical work with COVID patients in our medical center which was designated as a COVID-only hospital by the state. These groups are led by attending psychiatrists and psychiatry residents. In addition, we also deployed a system of telehealth individual counseling by attending psychiatrists. Anxiety was high in the beginning of our weekly groups, dealing with fear of contracting COVID or spreading COVID to family members and the stress of social distancing. Later, the focus was also on the impairment of the traditional clinician-patient relationship by the characteristics of this disease and the associated moral challenges and trauma. Clinicians were helped to cope with these issues through group processes such as ventilation of feelings, peer support, consensual validation, peer-learning, and interventions by group facilitators. People with severe anxiety or desiring confidentiality were helped through individual interventions. Our experience suggests that this method of offering telehealth peer support groups and individual counseling is a useful model for other centers to adapt to emotionally support frontline clinical workers in this ongoing worldwide crisis.","Viswanathan, Myers, Fanous","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.014","20200717","COVID; health care workers; mental health; support; telehealth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Belief in a COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory as a Predictor of Mental Health and Well-Being of Health Care Workers in Ecuador: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, social media platforms have become active sites for the dissemination of conspiracy theories that provide alternative explanations of the cause of the pandemic, such as secret plots by powerful and malicious groups. However, the association of individuals' beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. This paper identifies belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction among health care workers. This finding will enable mental health services to better target and provide help to mentally vulnerable health care workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Zhang, Jahanshahi, Alvarez-Risco, Dai, Li, Ibarra","https://doi.org/10.2196/20737","20200724","2019-nCoV; COVID-19; Latin America; conspiracy; coronavirus; health care worker; mental health; prediction; psychiatric identification; social media; well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: an evidence-based guidance for clinicians","COVID-19 presents unique challenges in healthcare, including mental health care provision. Telepsychiatry can provide an alternative to face to face assessment and can also be used creatively with other technologies to enhance care, but clinicians and patients may feel underconfident about embracing this new way of working. The aim was to produce an open access, easy-to-consult and reliable source of information and guidance about telepsychiatry and COVID-19 using an evidence-based approach. We systematically searched existing English language guidelines and websites for information on telepsychiatry in the context of COVID-19 up to and including May 2020. We used broad search criteria and included pre-COVID-19 guidelines and also other digital mental health topics where relevant. We summarised the data we extracted as answers to specific clinical questions. Findings from this study are presented as both a short practical checklist for clinicians and a detailed table with a full summary of all the guidelines. The summary tables are also available on an open access webpage (https://oxfordhealthbrc.nihr.ac.uk/our-work/oxppl/table-5-digital-technologies-and-telepsychiatry/) which is regularly updated. These findings reflect the strong evidence base for the use of telepsychiatry and include guidelines for many of the common concerns expressed by clinicians about practical implementation, technology, information governance and safety. Guidelines across countries differ significantly, with UK guidelines more conservative and focussed on practical implementation, and US guidelines more expansive and detailed. Guidelines on possible combination with other digital technologies such as apps, for example from the FDA, NHS Apps Library and NICE are less detailed. Several key areas were not represented. Whilst some special populations such as child and adolescent, older adult and cultural issues are specifically included, important populations such as learning disabilities, psychosis, personality disorder and eating disorders, which may present particular challenges for telepsychiatry, are not. In addition, initial consultation and follow-up sessions are not clearly distinguished. Finally, a hybrid model of care (combining telepsychiatry with other technologies and in-person care) is not explicitly covered by the existing guidelines. We produced a comprehensive synthesis of guidance answering a wide range of clinical questions in telepsychiatry. This meets the urgent need for practical information for both clinicians and health care organisations who are rapidly adapting to the pandemic and implementing remote consultation. It reflects variations across countries and can be used as a basis for organisational change in the short and longer term. Providing easily accessible guidance is a first step, but will need cultural change to implement, as clinicians start to view telepsychiatry not just as a replacement, but as a parallel and complimentary form of delivering therapy, with its own advantages and benefits as well as restrictions. A combination or hybrid approach can be the most successful approach in the new world of mental health post-COVID-19 and guidance will need to expand to encompass the use of telepsychiatry in conjunction with other in-person and digital technologies, and also its use across all psychiatric disorders, not just those who are the first to access and engage with remote treatment.","Smith, Ostinelli, Macdonald, Cipriani","https://doi.org/10.2196/21108","20200713",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms.

"Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project","Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1<sup>st</sup> 2020. Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified. Current psychological distress levels are elevated in individuals with mood disorder and are associated with maladaptive situational and lifestyle changes occurring in response to COVID-19.","Van Rheenen, Meyer, Neill, Phillipou, Tan, Toh, Rossell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.037","20200722","Alcohol use; Bipolar disorder; Coronavirus; Exercise; Major depressive disorder; sleep","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life in clinically stable patients with COVID-19","High risk of mental health problems is associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, Pâ€¯=â€¯0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P&lt;0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P&lt;0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19.

"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p&lt;0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p&lt;0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires. Our results suggest an elevated prevalence of depressive symptom in quarantined general individuals in Shenzhen. Some demographic and clinical variables were associated with depressive symptoms.","Peng, Mo, Liu, Xu, Song, Liu, Fang, Guo, Ye, Yu, Deng, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.035","20200722","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Post-traumatic stress symptoms; Quarantine; Sleep quality","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in china during the outbreak of COVID-19","The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87â€‚Â±â€‚15.79) and (29.27â€‚Â±â€‚19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099-1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209-2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252-7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609-0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923-0.951). Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.","Duan, Shao, Wang, Huang, Miao, Yang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029","20200722",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Well-Being Index (WBI) for schools: A brief measure of adolescents' mental health","Schools are increasingly concerned with the well-being of the whole child - likely, more so since the COVID-19 pandemic - and goals here were to document the psychometric properties of a brief new measure of adolescent mental health, the Well-Being Index (WBI). The measure assesses 4 symptom areas, 2 each of internalizing and externalizing symptoms-Depression, Anxiety, Rule-Breaking, and Substance Use-and an optional scale on Isolation at School. A total of 2,444 students from 2 high schools completed the WBI, the Youth Self-Report (YSR), and other related measures. Alpha coefficients showed acceptable internal consistency, with values for the 5 WBI subscales at .83, .84, .78, .79, and .74, respectively. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated consistent factorial validity. Correlations with corresponding YSR subscales indicated good convergent and discriminant validity. The WBI Substance Use and Isolation at School subscales, similarly, had high correlations with subscales from preexisting measures. Criterion-related validity was indicated in significant correlations between WBI subscales and conceptually related dimensions of close relationships. Also examined was the percentage of youth falling above clinical cutoffs on both the WBI and YSR, and findings demonstrated high concurrent validity. Collectively, results suggest the promise of the WBI as a brief, psychometrically sound measure to assess the adjustment of adolescents, along with perceptions of school climate that can be modified toward fostering their overall well-being.

After accounting for demographic characteristics, health status, other COVID-19 experiences, and anxiety symptoms, greater job insecurity due to COVID-19 was related to greater depressive symptoms. Conversely, after accounting for covariates and depressive symptoms, greater financial concern was related to greater anxiety symptoms. Further, greater job insecurity was indirectly related to greater anxiety symptoms due to greater financial concern. Findings suggest that employers should aim to reduce job insecurity and financial concern among employees during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the associated mental health consequences.","Wilson, Lee, Fitzgerald, Oosterhoff, Sevi, Shook","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000001962","20200713",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project ECHO Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs' manage COVID-19 distress. We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a 5-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a 5-point Likert scale. 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n=129) showed that most participants' reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean=4.26). HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sockalingam, Clarkin, Serhal, Pereira, Crawford","https://doi.org/10.1097/CEH.0000000000000311","20200713",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Tobacco smoking cessation in mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Tobacco smoking is more prevalent among people who experience mental illness. It is therefore a prominent issue for psychiatric inpatient units. The COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many psychiatric inpatient units are no longer granting leave and outdoor smoking breaks, prompting the question of whether to allow tobacco smoking or enforce smoking bans in mental health services. There is currently mixed evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with a higher risk of developing COVID-19 and poorer outcomes for COVID-19 cases, potentially due to current small sample sizes. Considering the benefits of smoking cessation in this vulnerable population, the current pandemic should be used as an opportunity to further enforce smoking cessation in mental health facilities and encourage nicotine replacement therapy alongside cessation counseling.","Seiler, Swamy, Xiao, Yun","https://doi.org/10.1080/10550887.2020.1791379","20200713","COVID-19; Tobacco; smoking","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Is the mental health of young students and their family members affected during the quarantine period? Evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic in Albania","The use of quarantine method has a significant impact on mental health status. This study aimed to assess the levels of depression among bachelor and master university students (nurses/midwives) and their family members' during the quarantine period of COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Vlora University, Albania. Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used. Institutional e-mails of all active students were used for their recruitment. In total, 863 students and 249 family members participated in the study. The mean PHQ-9 score was 6.220 (SD=5.803) and 6.280 (SD=5.857) for students and family members, respectively. Being unsatisfied with COVID-19 prevention measures, beliefs that COVID-19 infection and quarantine process can cause problems on their health status were the key factors for students to be screened positive for mental problems in multiple regression analysis. For parents, the last two factors were found to contribute significantly. Our findings indicate that quarantine measures have a significant impact on the levels of depression among both university students and their family members. Broader population studies are necessary to safeguard these results. Provision of mental health services during the quarantine period is of paramount significance. Mental health first aid trainingand support could benefit both students and their parents significantly. Additionally, follow up services after the end of quarantine are recommended.","Mechili, Saliaj, Kamberi, Girvalaki, Peto, Patelarou, Bucaj, Patelarou","https://doi.org/10.1111/jpm.12672","20200713","COVID-19; PHQ-9; depression; family members; quarantine; university students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The aim of the present study was to assess initial data on the mental health burden of the German public during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Germany and collected complete datasets from 15Â 704 German residents aged 18Â years and over. Besides demographics, generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2) and psychological distress (DT) were assessed. Furthermore, COVID-19-related fear, trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 were covered. Significantly increased symptoms were highly prevalent in all dimensions: generalized anxiety (44.9%), depression (14.3%), psychological distress (65.2%) and COVID-19-related fear (59%). Females and younger people reported higher mental burden. Trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19 and the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 are negatively associated with mental health burden. However, the subjective level of information regarding COVID-19 is positively associated with increased COVID-19-related fear. The provision of appropriate psychological interventions for those in need and the provision of transparency and comprehensible information are crucial during the current pandemic.","BÃ¤uerle, Teufel, Musche, WeismÃ¼ller, Kohler, Hetkamp, DÃ¶rrie, Schweda, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa106","20200713","COVID-19; COVID-19-related fear; depression; generalized anxiety; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Lessons from dermatology about inflammatory responses in Covid-19","The SARS-Cov-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus composed of 16 non-structural proteins (NSP 1-16) with specific roles in the replication of coronaviruses. NSP3 has the property to block host innate immune response and to promote cytokine expression. NSP5 can inhibit interferon (IFN) signalling and NSP16 prevents MAD5 recognition, depressing the innate immunity. Dendritic cells, monocytes, and macrophages are the first cell lineage against viruses' infections. The IFN type I is the danger signal for the human body during this clinical setting. Protective immune responses to viral infection are initiated by innate immune sensors that survey extracellular and intracellular space for foreign nucleic acids. In Covid-19 the pathogenesis is not yet fully understood, but viral and host factors seem to play a key role. Important points in severe Covid-19 are characterized by an upregulated innate immune response, hypercoagulopathy state, pulmonary tissue damage, neurological and/or gastrointestinal tract involvement, and fatal outcome in severe cases of macrophage activation syndrome, which produce a 'cytokine storm'. These systemic conditions share polymorphous cutaneous lesions where innate immune system is involved in the histopathological findings with acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypercoagulability, hyperferritinemia, increased serum levels of D-dimer, lactic dehydrogenase, reactive-C-protein and serum A amyloid. It is described that several polymorphous cutaneous lesions similar to erythema pernio, urticarial rashes, diffuse or disseminated erythema, livedo racemosa, blue toe syndrome, retiform purpura, vesicles lesions, and purpuric exanthema or exanthema with clinical aspects of symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema.

"Risk factors for psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Israel: Loneliness, age, gender, and health status play an important role","Research on the psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic is being conducted in various countries. This study aimed to examine risk factors for mental health problems among Israeli adults during this crisis. A total of 204 participants took part in the study. They completed self-report questionnaires assessing perceived stress, anxiety, quality of life, and various questions related to quarantine, pre-existing health issues, and worries related to the virus. The study took place during the last two weeks of March 2020. The majority of participants reported relatively high levels of perceived stress and corona-related worries, but low levels of anxiety. Female gender, younger age, corona-related loneliness, and pre-existing chronic illness were all related to higher levels of psychological distress and lower levels of quality of life. While considering the preliminary nature of these results, the current study highlights risk factors for psychological distress in light of the corona pandemic.

"Psychological Impact and Associated Factors During the Initial Stage of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Among the General Population in Spain","The outbreak of COVID-19 in Spain started at the end of February. By 9th April 2020 Spain was the second country in confirmed cases and in deaths. On March 14, 2020, the Spanish Government declared the state of alarm to limit viral transmission. During such state, citizens must stay confined at home with few justified exceptions. This whole situation drastically changed the life of the population, which can cause a wide range of psychosocial impacts. This study explored the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general adult population (<i>N</i> = 3055) during the first stages of the outbreak in Spain, as well as their anxiety, stress and depression levels. We also examined the extent to which the following variables were associated to participants' mental health: (1) demographics; (2) degree of concern about the pandemic; (3) environmental conditions during the home confinement, (4) changes in daily life as a consequence of the pandemic; (5) contact with the COVID-19 disease; (6) actual and perceived severity of the crisis; (7) information about the COVID-19, (8) perceived health status and (9) leisure activities conducted within the last 24 h. Our results show that Spanish consider the current COVID-19 health crisis as fairly severe, and the majority felt that the COVID-19 crisis had greatly impacted on their daily life, including changes in their daily routines and cancelation of important activities. About 36% of the participants reported moderate to severe psychological impact, 25% showed mild to severe levels of anxiety, 41% reported depressive symptoms, and 41% felt stressed. Women, young, and those who that lost their job during the health crisis showed the strongest negative psychological symptoms. What worried Spaniards the most was the likelihood of suffering an economic crisis derived from the pandemic. We found factors associated with better mental health, such as being satisfied with the information received about the health crisis, conducting leisure activities, and the perception of being in good health. These findings can be used to design psychological interventions to help coping with COVID-19 pandemic, both in Spain and other countries.","RodrÃ­guez-Rey, Garrido-Hernansaiz, Collado","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01540","20200714","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pandemic; psychological crisis intervention; psychological impact; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Debate: #Together despite the distance","The pandemic COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) has had a major global impact on the healthcare systems worldwide as they deal with the surge of critically ill persons. Additionally, the preventative measure of stay-at-home orders and closure of nonessential businesses has caused the disruption of entire communities. The child/youth mental health workforce bears the additional burden of the disruption of the systems-based practice crucial to the successful provision of mental health services. Major sources of stress for the workforce include: (a) a threat to the worker's personal/family health and life (traumatic injury), (b) a loss of colleagues or threat to professional mastery and identity (grief injury), (c) an inner conflict between ones' values and aspirations and what they are able to accomplish in their work (moral injury), and (d) fatigue, simply feeling worn out by the relentless work and need, without time for rest and recovery (fatigue injury). The rapid transformation of the in-person to virtual practice by the implementation of telehealth/telephonic sessions has eroded the boundary between personal/professional life and created a new Zoom fatigue.","Chrisman","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12406","20200712","COVID-19; disaster; mental health; pandemic; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Debate: COVID-19 and psychological well-being of children and adolescents in Italy","Italy was the first country in Europe to deal with COVID-19. Measures taken by the government to contain the spread of the virus were based mainly on quarantine and social distancing, with dramatic economic, social and psychological consequences. Since March, Italian children and adolescents are facing school closures, which have caused a disruption in the daily lives of millions of young people and their families. To date, despite the slow reopening, the government has decided to maintain school closures for the entire academic year, leaving the future of young people in uncertainty. There is already some evidence that quarantine and social isolation are having negative impact on children's and adolescents' psychological well-being. Moreover, this situation will mainly affect those children and adolescents with pre-existing vulnerabilities and those suffering of mental disorders. It is imperative to keep young people's needs at the core of reconstruction plans, allowing them to return to school safely, and providing them with some strategies to heal and dealing with this stressful and potentially traumatic situation.","Caffo, Scandroglio, Asta","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12405","20200712","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); adolescents; children; mental health; psychological well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

There was a significant increase of psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness, and worsening of quality of sleep in the general population. Participants completed an anonymous web-based survey that include questionnaires about sleep and anxiety and depression symptoms. Our sample included 400 subjects: 307 students (mean age 22.84â€‰Â±â€‰2.68) and 93 university administration staff workers (mean age 37.02â€‰Â±â€‰12.46). we found an increase in Bed Time hour, Sleep Latency, and Wake-Up time between before and during COVID-19 emergency and a worsening of sleep quality and of insomnia symptoms. In particular, during the lockdown, the impact of the delay in Bed Time and in Wake-Up was more pronounced in students. In workers, we observed a prevalence of maintenance insomnia before COVID-19 of 24% that significantly increase during COVID-19 reaching 40%, while workers with difficulties in sleep initiation were only 15% that increased to 42%. In our sample, 27.8% showed depressive symptoms, while 34.3% showed anxious symptoms, in particular in students. The impact of lockdown was greater in students than in workers, and in females than in males.

"Love in the Time of COVID-19: Sexual Function and Quality of Life Analysis During the Social Distancing Measures in a Group of Italian Reproductive-Age Women","The beginning of 2020 was characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. The world governments have adopted restrictive measures to reduce the spread of infection. These measures could affect the sexual function and quality of life of women living with their partner. The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner. Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak. The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire. 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28-50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3Â Â±Â 1.9 to 2.3Â Â±Â 1.8, mean difference:Â -3.9Â Â±Â 1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2Â Â±Â 4.2 vs 19.2Â Â±Â 3.3, mean difference:Â -9.7Â Â±Â 2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3Â Â±Â 5.5 vs 20.1Â Â±Â 5.2, mean difference: 10.8Â Â±Â 3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2Â Â±Â 10.2 to 64.2Â Â±Â 11.8 4Â weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference:Â -17.8Â Â±Â 6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity â‰¥1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the homeÂ +Â university educational levelÂ +Â parity â‰¥1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI. The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful. To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

"Anxiety and Depression of Nurses in a North West Province in China During the Period of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Outbreak","To investigate the anxiety and depression levels of frontline clinical nurses working in 14 hospitals in Gansu Province, China, during this period. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online between February 7 and 10, 2020, with a convenience sample of 22,034 nurses working in 14 prefecture and city hospitals in Gansu Province, located in northwest China. A self-reported questionnaire with four parts (demographic characteristics, general questions related to novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, self-rating anxiety scale, and self-rating depression scale) was administered. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and SDs were computed. The associations between anxiety and depression with sociodemographic characteristics, work-related concerns, and impacts were analyzed, followed by multivariable logistic regression to identify factors that best predicted the nurses' anxiety and depression levels. A total of 21,199 questionnaires were checked to be valid, with an effective recovery rate of 96.21%. The mean Â± SD age of the respondents was 31.89 Â± 7.084 years, and the mean Â± SD length of service was 9.40 Â± 7.638 years. The majority of the respondents were female (98.6%) and married (73.1%). Some demographic characteristics, related concerns, and impacts of COVID-19 were found to be significantly associated with both anxiety (p &lt; .001) and depression (p &lt; .001). Nurses who needed to take care of children or elderly relatives, took leave from work because they were worried about COVID-19, avoided contact with family and friends, and wanted to obtain more COVID-19-related knowledge had higher levels of both anxiety and depression. Results show that nurses faced with the COVID-19 outbreak are at risk for experiencing anxiety and depression. Demographic background, psychosocial factors, and work-related factors predicted the psychological responses. The family responsibilities and burdens of women may explain the higher levels of anxiety and depression among nurses with these obligations as compared to those without. On the other hand, nurses who chose not to take leave from work or who did not avoid going to work during this period were less anxious and depressed. Professional commitment might be a protective factor for adverse psychological responses. It is pertinent to provide emotional support for nurses and recognize their professional commitment in providing service to people in need.","Han, Wong, She, Li, Yang, Jiang, Ruan, Su, Ma, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1111/jnu.12590","20200711",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Forty-four studies are included in this review. Between 11 and 73.4% of HCWs, mainly including physicians, nurses, and auxiliary staff, reported post-traumatic stress symptoms during outbreaks, with symptoms lasting after 1-3Â years in 10-40%. Depressive symptoms are reported in 27.5-50.7%, insomnia symptoms in 34-36.1%, and severe anxiety symptoms in 45%. General psychiatric symptoms during outbreaks have a range comprised between 17.3 and 75.3%; high levels of stress related to working are reported in 18.1 to 80.1%. Several individual and work-related features can be considered risk or protective factors, such as personality characteristics, the level of exposure to affected patients, and organizational support. Empirical evidence underlines the need to address the detrimental effects of epidemic/pandemic outbreaks on HCWs' mental health. Recommendations should include the assessment and promotion of coping strategies and resilience, special attention to frontline HCWs, provision of adequate protective supplies, and organization of online support services.","Preti, Di Mattei, Perego, Ferrari, Mazzetti, Taranto, Di Pierro, Madeddu, Calati","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-020-01166-z","20200717","COVID-19; Epidemic; Healthcare workers; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychological distress; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Personnel; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Influenza, Human; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"When altruists cannot help: the influence of altruism on the mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The positive predictive effect of altruism on physical and psychological well-being has been extensively demonstrated in previous studies, but few studies have examined the effect of altruism on negative mental health outcomes when altruists cannot perform altruistic behaviours. This study explored the influence of altruism on negative affect and mental health (anxiety and depressive symptoms) during the COVID-19 pandemic while people self-isolated at home in China. University students were recruited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey during the outbreak of COVID-19 in China. Self-reported perceived risk, altruism, negative affect, anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Self-Report Altruism Scale (SRA scale), the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-9). A structural equation model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects on mental health. The final sample comprised 1346 Chinese participants (Mageâ€‰=â€‰19.76â€‰Â±â€‰2.23â€‰years, 73% female). Overall, the higher the risk the participants perceived, the more negative affect they exhibited (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.16, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), and thus, the more anxious and depressed they felt (Î²â€‰=â€‰0.134, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001); however, this relationship between risk perception and negative affect was moderated by altruism. In contrast to previous studies, the increase in negative affect associated with the increased perceived risk was pronounced among individuals with high altruism (tâ€‰=â€‰7.68, pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Individuals with high altruism exhibited more negative affect than those with low altruism, which indirectly increased their anxiety and depressive symptoms. These findings enrich theories of altruism and provide valuable insight into the influence of altruism on mental health during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Feng, Zong, Yang, Gu, Dong, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00587-y","20200716","Altruism; COVID-19; Mental health; Negative affect; Perceived risk; Adolescent; Affect; Altruism; Anxiety; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Self Report; Students; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 pandemic and psychological fatigue in Turkey","The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological fatigue as a mental health issue among the population of Istanbul, Turkey. This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (<i>p</i> &lt; .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (<i>p</i> = .008) and isolation (<i>p</i> = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>p</i> &lt; .001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that level of education, avoiding going to crowded places, eye, nose and mouth organs are sensitive organs to the virus, keeping physical distance due to epidemic affect by COVID-19 virus, isolation and treatment of people reduce the spread of COVID-19 virus and 14-days period of time, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected person, occupational status, health education programme needed and antibody treatment variables were significantly associated with fatigue after adjusting for age, gender and income variables.

"Prevalence and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms during the COVID-19 Pandemic and Compliance with Precautionary Measures: Age and Sex Matter","Effective management of the global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (also known as COVID-19), resulted in the implementation of severe restrictions in movement and enforcement of social distancing measures. This study aimed to understand and characterize the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population and to identify risks and protective factors that predict changes in mental health status. In addition, the study investigated compliance with precautionary measures (PM) to halt the spread of the virus. The online anonymous survey collected information on sociodemographic data, compliance with PM, quality of life (QOL), and mental health via the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). A total of 1642 adult participants (71.6% women, 28.4% men) completed the survey in the European island country, Cyprus. A large percentage (48%) reported significant financial concerns and 66.7% significant changes in their QOL. About 41% reported symptoms associated with mild anxiety; 23.1% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms. Concerning depression, 48% reported mild and 9.2% moderate-severe depression symptoms. Women, younger age (18-29), student status, unemployment status, prior psychiatric history, and those reporting greater negative impact on their QOL, were at higher risk for increased anxiety and depression symptoms (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The youngest age group and males also reported lower levels of compliance with PM. Higher compliance with PM predicted lower depression scores (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) but higher anxiety for measures related to personal hygiene. The results of this study provide important data on the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and QOL and identify a variety of personal and social determinants that serve as risks and protective factors. Furthermore, it has implications for policy makers demonstrating the need for effective mental health programs and guidance for the implementation of PM as a public health strategy.","Solomou, Constantinidou","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17144924","20200717","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; precautionary measures; psychological effects; quality of life; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cyprus; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Patient Compliance; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universal Precautions; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.","Lee, Jobe, Mathis, Gibbons","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268","20200720","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronaphobia; Coronavirus; Death anxiety; Depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mentality and behavior in COVID-19 emergency status in Japan: Influence of personality, morality and ideology","The COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019 and severely influenced society. In response, the Japanese government declared a state of emergency on 7th April in seven prefectures. The study conducted an immediate survey on 8th April to record the response of the general public to the first emergency status due to epidemics. The study hypothesized that personality traits, moral foundation, and political ideology can influence people's mentality, cognition, and behavior toward COVID-19. Based on a nationwide dataset of 1856 respondents (male = 56.3%, Mage = 46.7, emergency regions = 49.9%), the study found that personality, morality, and ideology altered mental health status and motivated behaviors toward COVID-19. Neuroticism and avoiding harm involved cognition and behavior through various means. The study also found significant differences among demographic groups. Results are informative and contributive to the governance and management of, and aid for, individual responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Qian, Yahara","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235883","20200717","Attitude; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Morals; Pandemics; Personality; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological health, sleep quality, and coping styles to stress facing the COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","To understand Wuhan residents' psychological reactions to the COVID-19 epidemic and offer a reference point for interventions, an online questionnaire survey was conducted. It included the Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-Item Scale (PHQ-9), Athens Insomnia Scale, and Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire. Categorical data were reported as numbers and percentages. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between demographic factors and anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style. A total of 1242 Wuhan residents investigated, 27.5% had anxiety, 29.3% had depression, 30.0% had a sleep disorder, and 29.8% had a passive response to COVID-19. Being female was the risk factor for anxiety (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.62) and sleep disorder (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.36); being married was associated with anxiety (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.75); having a monthly income between 1000 and 5000 CNY (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.44, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.83, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.61) or &gt;5000 CNY (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.47, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.45, ORâ€‰=â€‰2.14) was a risk factor for anxiety, depression, and sleep disorder; not exercising (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.45, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.71, ORâ€‰=â€‰1. 85, ORâ€‰=â€‰1.71) was a common risk factor for anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, and passive coping style; and having a higher education level (bachelor's degree and above) (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.40) was associated with having a sleep disorder. Wuhan residents' psychological status and sleep quality were relatively poorer than they were before the COVID-19 epidemic; however, the rate of passive coping to stress was relatively higher.","Fu, Wang, Zou, Guo, Lu, Yan, Mao","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00913-3","20200720","Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sleep Wake Disorders; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Challenges and recommendations for mental health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic: the experience of China's First University-based mental health team","Coronavirus Disease is impacting the entire world. As the first country that has needed to confront this disease, China has responded with unprecedented and hugely successful public health initiatives. Almost simultaneous with the awareness of the potential for widespread loss of life, the first Chinese university recognizing the likely psychological impacts of COVID-19, assembled the first university-based professional team to offer pandemic-related mental health services to the Chinese public. This paper describes the work that we provided and the challenges encountered. The challenges are described in four contexts: the organizational/systemic level, the technical perspective, the therapeutic process, and the ethical aspects. We also provide recommendations on what we can do in the short term, and future improvements that can be made.","Chen, Li, Lin, Han, Nie, Portnoy, Qiao","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00591-2","20200714","COVID-19; Challenges; China; Mental health provider; Recommendations; China; Coronavirus Infections; Health Services Research; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Universities","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Differences in Sense of Belonging, Pride, and Mental Health in the Daegu Metropolitan Region due to COVID-19: Comparison between the Presence and Absence of National Disaster Relief Fund","Korea's Daegu Metropolitan City once had the second highest rate of COVID-19 infection after Wuhan in China. Following the outbreak, the government provided the first national disaster relief fund to citizens as financial aid. This study investigated whether the sense of regional belonging, pride, and mental health among 550 citizens of Daegu differed between the times before and after COVID-19, based on the presence or absence of the disaster relief fund. Frequency analysis, descriptive statistical analysis, and <i>t</i>-tests were conducted using the SPSS 25.0 program. Results showed that the sense of belonging was higher after COVID-19 than before, while pride was lower. Individuals who received the disaster relief fund showed higher levels of regional belonging and pride with statistical significance. The prevalence of melancholy and depression increased after COVID-19, but the presence or absence of the fund did not lead to a significant difference. Thus, in case of a future national disaster level, provision of the disaster relief fund can raise the sense of regional belonging and pride, in order to elicit communication among local residents toward overcoming difficulties. Furthermore, during challenging disaster situations, central and local governments should provide diverse programs for the citizens' mental health care.","Kim, Cho, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134910","20200717","COVID-19; Daegu; disaster relief fund; mental health; pride; sense of belonging; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Disasters; Emotions; Female; Financial Management; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Republic of Korea; Sociological Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Changes in Weight and Nutritional Habits in Adults with Obesity during the &quot;Lockdown&quot; Period Caused by the COVID-19 Virus Emergency","Our aim is evaluating the changes in weight and dietary habits in a sample of outpatients with obesity after 1 month of enforced lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy. In this observational retrospective study, the patients of our Obesity Unit were invited to answer to a 12-question multiple-choice questionnaire relative to weight changes, working activity, exercise, dietary habits, and conditions potentially impacting on nutritional choices. A multivariate regression analysis was performed to evaluate the associations among weight/BMI changes and the analyzed variables. A total of 150 subjects (91.5%) completed the questionnaire. Mean self-reported weight gain was â‰ˆ1.5 kg (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Lower exercise, self-reported boredom/solitude, anxiety/depression, enhanced eating, consumption of snacks, unhealthy foods, cereals, and sweets were correlated with a significantly higher weight gain. Multiple regression analyses showed that increased education (inversely, Î² = -1.15; 95%CI -2.13, -0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.022), self-reported anxiety/depression (Î² = 1.61; 0.53, 2.69, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and not consuming healthy foods (Î² = 1.48; 0.19, 2.77, <i>p</i> = 0.026) were significantly associated with increased weight gain. The estimated direct effect of self-reported anxiety/depression on weight was 2.07 kg (1.07, 3.07, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Individuals with obesity significantly gained weight 1 month after the beginning of the quarantine.

"Physical health among people with serious mental illness in the face of COVID-19: Concerns and mitigation strategies","COVID-19 can worsen the physical health of individuals with serious mental illness, a vulnerable group already facing physical health disparities. COVID-19 is further reducing access to physical health care due to shutdown of services deemed &quot;non-urgent&quot; and overcrowding of emergency services. Management of chronic diseases, highly prevalent in this group, is undermined due to exacerbation of psychiatric disorders, reduction in availability of social support, and worsening of negative social determinants of health. In this commentary, we discuss the challenges experienced by this group and offer mitigation strategies to reduce: (1) inequalities in access to physical health care; and (2) disruptions to the management of chronic physical conditions in the face of COVID-19. Recommendations include coordinated efforts by health authorities, primary and mental health care organizations, researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These efforts should ensure equitable access to physical health care and implementation of innovative programs to protect the physical health of people with serious mental illness during and following the pandemic.","Melamed, Hahn, Agarwal, Taylor, Mulsant, Selby","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.013","20200724","Bipolar disorder; COVID-19; Chronic medical conditions; Health services; Physical health; Primary care; Quality of health care; Schizophrenia; Serious mental illness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Understanding the Perceived Mental Health of Canadians During the COVID-19 Pandemic","While the physical health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic are regularly publicly available, the mental health toll on Canadians is unknown. This article examines the self-perceived mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic and explores associations with various concerns after accounting for socioeconomic and health factors. The cross-sectional Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 1 collected information related to COVID-19 in late March and early April 2020 concerning labour market participation, behaviours, and health for the Canadian population 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces. Socioeconomic and health characteristics of respondents as well as concerns about the impact of COVID-19 were examined to determine differences in experiencing excellent or very good compared to good, fair or poor perceived mental health. Just over half of Canadians aged 15 and older (54%) reported excellent or very good mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several concerns were also associated with mental health. Notably, after considering the effects of socioeconomic and health characteristics, women, youth, individuals with a physical health condition and those who were very or extremely concerned with family stress from confinement were less likely to report excellent or very good mental health. These findings point to particular risks for lower perceived mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results highlight various concerns of Canadians which may be associated with mental health, in particular, family stress in the home.","Findlay, Arim, Kohen","https://doi.org/10.25318/82-003-x202000400003-eng","20200724","COVID-19; concerns; family stress; perceived mental health; social determinants of mental health; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Canada; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sex Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological and Ocular Surface State of Ophthalmologists and Ophthalmic Nurses Working With Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019","The influence on the psychology and ocular surface of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is not yet fully understood. To characterize mental state and ocular surface state of ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and similar areas during the COVID-19 outbreak. This survey study assessed ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan, China, and Jiangxi, China, a province approximately 300 km south of Wuhan. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index were used to conduct questionnaire surveys via a messaging and social media app. Mean scores from the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (0-10 points), the Van Dream Anxiety Scale (0-100 points), and the Ocular Surface Disease Index (0-100 points). Of 126 individuals, there were 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 ophthalmic nurses (16.7%) from Wuhan and 42 ophthalmologists (33.3%) and 21 nurses (16.7%) from Jiangxi. The mean (SD) age of ophthalmologists was 36.1 (7.6) years in Wuhan and 41.2 (8.8) years in Jiangxi. For ophthalmic nurses, the mean (SD) age was 35.2 (7.4) years in Wuhan and 33.4 (7.9) years in Jiangxi. The response rate for ophthalmologists was 90.3% (84 of 93) and for nurses was 91.3% (42 of 46). The participation rate of ophthalmologists and nurses in Wuhan was 0.06% (42 of 70â€¯000) and 0.07% (21 of 30â€¯000), respectively; the participation rate in Jiangxi was 0.06% (42 of 70â€¯000; 21 of 35â€¯000) for both groups. In Wuhan, the mean (SD) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (anxiety and depression were counted as separate scores), Van Dream Anxiety Scale, and the Ocular Surface Disease Index scores were 6.90â€‰(2.30), 7.38â€‰(2.19), 24.52â€‰(5.86), and 43.90â€‰(3.74), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 8.67â€‰(3.04), 9.38â€‰(2.64), 21.48â€‰(6.15), and 40.05â€‰(6.67), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. In Jiangxi, these scores were 5.67â€‰(2.89), 4.90â€‰(3.15), 12.76â€‰(7.27), and 38.79â€‰(7.78), respectively, in ophthalmologists and 4.67â€‰(3.20), 4.33â€‰(3.23), 10.10â€‰(7.62), and 41.52â€‰(5.92), respectively, in ophthalmic nurses. The difference (95% CI) between the 2 regions for these scores in ophthalmologists was 2.48 (95% CI, 1.30-3.65), 11.76 (95% CI, 8.90-14.63), 5.12 (95% CI, 2.45-7.79), and 5.12 (95% CI, 2.47-7.77), respectively, and in ophthalmic nurses was 4.16 (95% CI, 2.05-5.95), 5.05 (95% CI, 3.21-6.89), 11.38 (95% CI, 7.06-15.70), and -1.48 (95% CI, -5.41 to 2.25), respectively. These findings suggest that ophthalmologists and ophthalmic nurses in Wuhan experienced more anxiety and depression and reported greater ocular surface abnormalities than counterparts outside of Wuhan, but the wide CIs preclude concluding confidently that there were differences.","Shao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2020.2289","20200714",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The 12 point 'online' ALCOVID survey with a cover letter was designed and addressed to physicians, recruited online via accessible networks, who underwent isolation or quarantine during recent pandemic. The AUDIT-3 scale was included. A representative trial of 113 physicians participated in the study. Over 53% of screened doctors revealed that the amounts of the consumed alcohol have escalated; almost 20% of subjects binged over seven standard drinks for one occasion. Close to every second used six or more drinks on one occasion. Over 40% used alcohol more than four times per week. Female used alcohol more often and more standard drinks per occasion. Male binged more. Anxiety and hopelessness were the most common motives to drink. Alcohol consumption in physicians in quarantine has threateningly increased.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Neurosurgical Practice in India: Results of an Anonymized National Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has created an unprecedented challenge for medical professionals throughout the world to tackle the rapidly changing scenario. The objective of this survey was to analyze the change in neurosurgical practice in India following the COVID-19 outbreak and assess its impact on practising neurosurgeons. Between May 7<sup>th</sup> and 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2020, a validated questionnaire was circulated amongst practising neurosurgeons across the country by social media and e-mails, regarding changes in the patterns of patients seen, adaptations made in their practice, effect on surgeries performed, financial burden, and impact on their personal lives. The responses were kept anonymous and were analyzed for correlations between the changes observed and independent factors such as hospital affiliations, teaching professions, and neurosurgical experience. Our survey showed a drastic fall in the number of neurosurgical patients seen in the outpatient department (OPD) as well as the number of surgeries performed. A drop of 76.25% was seen in OPD patients (P = 0.000) and that of 70.59% in surgeries performed (P = 0.000). There was no uniformity among the neurosurgeons in the number of COVID-19 tests being done before elective/emergency surgery and in the use of protective gear while examining patients. Private practitioners were more affected financially as compared to those in the government sector. The pandemic has affected the research work of 53.23% of all respondents, with those in the teaching profession (70.96%) more affected than those in the non-teaching profession (24.67%). Evidence-based policies, screening COVID-19 tests with better sensitivity, and better-quality personal protective equipment kits in adequate numbers are required to protect our medical professionals from COVID-19. Mental health issues among neurosurgeons may also be an issue, this being a high risk speciality and should be closely watched for.","Venkataram, Goyal, Dash, Chandra, Chaturvedi, Raheja, Singla, Sardhara, Singh, Gupta","https://doi.org/10.4103/0028-3886.289004","20200717","COVID-19 (coronavirus disease of 2019); India; neurosurgical practice; personal protective equipment; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; India; Male; Mass Screening; Neurosurgeons; Neurosurgery; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Association between social support and anxiety among pregnant women in the third trimester during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in Qingdao, China: The mediating effect of risk perception","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a threat to the mental health of pregnant women. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between social support and anxiety, and the mediating effect of risk perception during the COVID-19 epidemic in the third trimester pregnant women in Qingdao, China. From 16 to 21 February 2020, an online survey was conducted, which collected the information on demographic data, anxiety, social support and risk perception to COVID-19 of women with established medical records in the ambulatory of the Department of Obstetrics at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Anxiety was assessed by the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), social support was assessed by the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) and risk perception was assessed by a self-designed questionnaire. This study had 308 participants with an average of 31.02 Â± 3.91 years. During the period of prevention and control of the epidemic, most pregnant women adopted protective measures, such as wearing masks (97.4%), washing hands frequently (88.3%) and staying at home (76.3%). The average SAS, SSRS and risk perception scores of the participants were 42.45 Â± 6.98, 44.60 Â± 7.00 and 21.60 Â± 5.74, respectively.

"Use of technology by orientation and mobility professionals in Australia and Malaysia before COVID-19","Orientation and Mobility (O&amp;M) professionals teach people with low vision or blindness to use specialist assistive technologies to support confident travel, but many O&amp;M clients now prefer a smartphone. This study aimed to investigate what technology O&amp;M professionals in Australia and Malaysia have, use, like, and want to support their client work, to inform the development of O&amp;M technologies and build capacity in the international O&amp;M profession. A technology survey was completed by professionals (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰36) attending O&amp;M workshops in Malaysia. A revised survey was completed online by O&amp;M specialists (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰31) primarily in Australia. Qualitative data about technology use came from conferences, workshops and interviews with O&amp;M professionals. Descriptive statistics were analysed together with free-text data. Limited awareness of apps used by clients, unaffordability of devices, and inadequate technology training discouraged many O&amp;M professionals from employing existing technologies in client programmes or for broader professional purposes. Professionals needed to learn smartphone accessibility features and travel-related apps, and ways to use technology during O&amp;M client programmes, initial professional training, ongoing professional development and research. Smartphones are now integral to travel with low vision or blindness and early-adopter O&amp;M clients are the travel tech-experts. O&amp;M professionals need better initial training and then regular upskilling in mainstream O&amp;M technologies to expand clients' travel choices. COVID-19 has created an imperative for technology laggards to upskill for O&amp;M tele-practice. O&amp;M technology could support comprehensive O&amp;M specialist training and practice in Malaysia, to better serve O&amp;M clients with complex needs. Implications for rehabilitation Most orientation and mobility (O&amp;M) clients are travelling with a smartphone, so O&amp;M specialists need to be abreast of mainstream technologies, accessibility features and apps used by clients for orientation, mobility, visual efficiency and social engagement. O&amp;M specialists who are technology laggards need human-guided support to develop confidence in using travel technologies, and O&amp;M clients are the experts. COVID-19 has created an imperative to learn skills for O&amp;M tele-practice. Affordability is a significant barrier to O&amp;M professionals and clients accessing specialist travel technologies in Malaysia, and to O&amp;M professionals upgrading technology in Australia.

"Mental Health During the Covid-19 Outbreak in China: a Meta-Analysis","Covid-19 has started to spread within China since the end of December 2019. Despite government's immediate actions and strict control, more and more people were infected every day. As such a contagious virus can spread easily and rapidly between people, the whole country was put into lockdown and people were forced into isolation. In order to understand the impact of Covid-19 on mental health well-being, Chinese researchers have conducted several studies. However, no consistent results were obtained. Therefore, a meta-analysis was conducted. We searched Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases to find literature from December 2019 to April 2020 related to Covid-19 and mental health, among which results such as comments, letters, reviews and case reports were excluded. The incidence of anxiety and depression in the population was synthesized and discussed. A total of 27,475 subjects were included in 12 studies. Random effect model is used to account for the data. The results showed that the incidence of anxiety was 25% (95% CI: 0.19-0.32), and the incidence of depression was 28% (95% CI: 0.17-0.38). Significant heterogeneity was detected across studies regarding these incidence estimates. Subgroup analysis included the study population and assessment tools, and sensitivity analysis was done to explore the sources of heterogeneity. Owing to the significant heterogeneity detected in studies regarding this pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression, we must interpret the results with caution. As the epidemic is ongoing, it is vital to set up a comprehensive crisis prevention system, which integrating epidemiological monitoring, screening and psychological crisis prevention and interventions.","Ren, Huang, Pan, Huang, Wang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09796-5","20200711","Anxiety; Covid-19; Depression; Mental health; Meta-analysis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The experience of women infected by the COVID-19 during pregnancy in Brazil: a qualitative study protocol","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is highly infectious, with the recent World Health Organization decree confirming a global public health emergency. The outcomes related to maternal and fetal health among pregnant women infected with the virus are still poorly understood. The world population has been waiting for answers and remains constantly alert about the pandemic's progress. It is not yet known what impact this pandemic experience will have on the population's mental health, especially pregnant women. We aim to understand and discuss the experiences of women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy, in relation to the illness process, community relations, and social media influences. This is a qualitative study in which we will interview women who were infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy and received medical care from a tertiary university hospital specializing in women's health in Brazil. We will use the techniques of Semi-Directed Interviews of Open and In-depth Questions, socio-demographic and health data sheets, and Field Diaries. We will use purposive sampling and the criterion of theoretical saturation for its construction. The interviews will be conducted by phone or video call, with audio recorded for later transcription. The treatment of the data will be completed through Thematic Analysis and discussed in light of the Health Psychology framework, with the production of categories that answer the proposed research questions. It is expected that the results contribute to the understanding about the demands that come to the health professional of women infected by COVID-19 during pregnancy in a pandemic situation.

"Caspase1/11 signaling affects muscle regeneration and recovery following ischemia, and can be modulated by chloroquine","We previously showed that the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) increases inflammatory cleaved caspase-1 activity in myocytes, and that caspase-1/11 is protective in sterile liver injury. However, the role of caspase-1/11 in the recovery of muscle from ischemia caused by peripheral arterial disease is unknown. We hypothesized that caspase-1/11 mediates recovery in muscle via effects on autophagy and this is modulated by CQ. C57Bl/6â€‰J (WT) and caspase-1/11 double-knockout (KO) mice underwent femoral artery ligation (a model of hind-limb ischemia) with or without CQ (50â€‰mg/kg IP every 2nd day). CQ effects on autophagosome formation, microtubule associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), and caspase-1 expression was measured using electron microscopy and immunofluorescence. Laser Doppler perfusion imaging documented perfusion every 7â€‰days. After 21â€‰days, in situ physiologic testing in tibialis anterior muscle assessed peak force contraction, and myocyte size and fibrosis was also measured. Muscle satellite cell (MuSC) oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate was measured. Caspase-1 and glycolytic enzyme expression was detected by Western blot. CQ increased autophagosomes, LC3 consolidation, total caspase-1 expression and cleaved caspase-1 in muscle. Perfusion, fibrosis, myofiber regeneration, muscle contraction, MuSC fusion, OCR, ECAR and glycolytic enzyme expression was variably affected by CQ depending on presence of caspase-1/11. CQ decreased perfusion recovery, fibrosis and myofiber size in WT but not caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ diminished peak force in whole muscle, and myocyte fusion in MuSC and these effects were exacerbated in caspase-1/11KO mice. CQ reductions in maximal respiration and ATP production were reduced in caspase-1/11KO mice. Caspase-1/11KO MuSC had significant increases in protein kinase isoforms and aldolase with decreased ECAR. Caspase-1/11 signaling affects the response to ischemia in muscle and effects are variably modulated by CQ. This may be critically important for disease treated with CQ and its derivatives, including novel viral diseases (e.g. COVID-19) that are expected to affect patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease.","Sachdev, Ferrari, Cui, Pius, Sahu, Reynolds, Liao, Sun, Shinde, Ambrosio, Shiva, Loughran, Scott","https://doi.org/10.1186/s10020-020-00190-2","20200720","Autophagy; Glycolysis; Inflammasome; Ischemic muscle; Lysosomal inhibition; Oxidative phosphorylation; Animals; Autophagosomes; Autophagy; Betacoronavirus; Caspase 1; Caspases, Initiator; Chloroquine; Coronavirus Infections; Glycolysis; Ischemia; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Muscle Cells; Muscle Development; Muscle, Skeletal; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pandemics; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Pneumonia, Viral; Regeneration; Signal Transduction","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How do Funeral Practices impact Bereaved Relatives' Mental Health, Grief and Bereavement? A Mixed Methods Review with Implications for COVID-19","Those who are bereaved during the current COVID-19 pandemic are subject to restrictions on funeral sizes and practices. We conducted a rapid review synthesising the quantitative and qualitative evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes. Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, KSR Evidence, and COVID-related resources were conducted. 805 records were screened; 17 studies of variable quality were included. Current evidence regarding the effect of funeral practices on bereaved relatives' mental health and bereavement outcomes is inconclusive. Five observational studies found benefits from funeral participation while six did not. However, qualitative research provides additional insight: the benefit of after-death rituals including funerals depends on the ability of the bereaved to shape those rituals and say goodbye in a way which is meaningful for them. Findings highlight the important role of funeral officiants during the pandemic. Research is needed to better understand the experiences and sequalae of grief and bereavement during COVID-19.","Burrell, Selman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0030222820941296","20200709","bereavement; burial; funerals; grief; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Global Storm of Stress-Related Psychopathological Symptoms: A Brief Overview on the Usefulness of Virtual Reality in Facing the Mental Health Impact of COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a global health emergency requiring clinicians to be prepared to cope with the increase in the future incidence of trauma and stress-related psychopathological symptoms. The early detection of psychological distress and timely intervention are strongly recommended. Clinicians should also consider integrating new technologies such as virtual reality (VR) in the treatment of these trauma and stress-related psychopathological symptoms.

"Survey on Knowledge and Psychological Crisis Related to COVID-19 among Nursing Staff: A Cross-sectional Study","Background: Since December 2019, the prevalence of COVID-19 is rapidly spreading in the world. Nurses play a key role in fighting this disease and are at risk of infection by coronavirus. Therefore, there is a urging need to assess their mental health condition and set up appropriate interventions to reduce the negative psychiatric outcomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge and psychological crisis related to COVID-19 among nursing staff, and to provide evidence for targeted training and psychological intervention. This cross-sectional online survey study was performed in a class three grade A general hospital from a southwest province of China from March 1 to March 15, 2020. A self-designed questionnaire of COVID-19 related prevention and control knowledge and the Triages Assessment Form (TAF) were used to assess nursing staff's knowledge of COVID-19 and their degree of psychological crisis. SPSS 23.0 was applied to compute the collected data. A total of 979 nursing staff completed the questionnaire. The results showed that nursing staff have lower number of correct answers of continuous viral nucleic acid testing specifications (38.7%), debarment criteria (55.1%), and management measures for patients with suspected symptoms (72.8%). The overall score of the TAF was 7.0 (5.0-12.0), and there were statistical significance in scores between different types of personnel, years of work experience and department (P &lt;.05). This study indicated that nursing staff have insufficient knowledge about COVID-19. Meanwhile, despite the psychological damage of nursing staff is slight, nurse manager must continue to monitor their mental health and take timely interventions.","Huang, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.2196/20606","20200708",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from patients, caregivers and potential living donors-a qualitative study","Many countries have suspended kidney transplantation programs during the COVID-19 pandemic because of concerns for patient safety and the shortage of healthcare resources. This study aimed to describe patient, family member and potential donor perspectives on the suspension and resumption of kidney transplant programs due to COVID-19. We conducted seven online focus groups involving 31 adult kidney transplant candidates (n=22), caregivers (n=4) and potential donors (n=5). Transcripts were analyzed thematically. We identified five themes: cascading disappointments and devastation (with subthemes of shattering hope, succumbing to defeat, regret and guilt); helplessness and vulnerability (fear of declining health, confronted by the threat of and change in dialysis, disconnected from healthcare, susceptibility to infective complications); stress from uncertainty (confusion from conflicting information, unable to forward plan), exacerbating burdens (incurring extra financial costs, intensifying caregiver responsibilities), and sustaining health through the delay (protecting eligibility, relying on social support, adapting to emerging modalities of care). During the suspension of kidney transplantation programs, patients felt medically vulnerable because of declining health, susceptibility to infection and reduced access to care. There is a need to address health vulnerabilities, disappointment, uncertainty and additional burdens arising from the suspension of kidney transplantation programs.","Guha, Tong, Baumgart, Scholes-Robertson, Isbel, Kanellis, Campbell, Coates, Chadban","https://doi.org/10.1111/tri.13697","20200717","COVID-19; Coronavirus; patient-centered care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Implementation of Home-Based Telemental Health in a Large Child Psychiatry Department During the COVID-19 Crisis","<b> <i>Objective:</i> </b> Telemental health (TMH) is not well described for mental health service delivery during crises. Most child and adolescent psychiatry training programs have not integrated TMH into their curricula and are ill equipped to respond during crises to their patients' needs. In this study, we present the implementation of a home-based TMH (HB-TMH) service during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> We describe the technological, administrative, training, and clinical implementation components involved in transitioning a comprehensive outpatient child and adolescent psychiatry program to a HB-TMH virtual clinic. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> The transition was accomplished in 6 weeks. Most in-clinic services were rapidly moved off campus to the home. Owing to challenges encountered with each implementation component, phone sessions bridged the transition from in-clinic to reliable virtual appointments. Within 3 weeks (March 20, 2020) of planning for HB-TMH, 67% of all appointments were conducted at home, and within 4 weeks (March 27, 2020), 90% were conducted at home. By week 6 (April 3, 2020), reliable HB-TMH appointments were implemented. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> The COVID-19 pandemic crisis created the opportunity to innovate a solution to disrupted care for our established patients and to create a resource for youth who developed problems during the crisis. Our department was experienced in providing TMH services that facilitated the transition to HB-TMH, yet still had to overcome known and unanticipated challenges. Our experience provides a roadmap for establishing a HB-TMH service with focus on rapid implementation. It also demonstrates a role for TMH during (rather than after) future crises when usual community resources are not available.","Sharma, Sasser, Schoenfelder Gonzalez, Vander Stoep, Myers","https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2020.0062","20200708","COVID-19 pandemic; crisis; home-based telemental health; telepsychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Concentration-dependent mortality of chloroquine in overdose","Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are used extensively in malaria and rheumatological conditions, and now in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. Although generally safe they are potentially lethal in overdose. <i>In-vitro</i> data suggest that high concentrations and thus high doses are needed for COVID-19 infections, but as yet there is no convincing evidence of clinical efficacy. Bayesian regression models were fitted to survival outcomes and electrocardiograph QRS durations from 302 prospectively studied French patients who had taken intentional chloroquine overdoses, of whom 33 died (11%), and 16 healthy volunteers who took 620 mg base chloroquine single doses. Whole blood concentrations of 13.5 umol/L (95% credible interval 10.1-17.7) were associated with 1% mortality. Prolongation of ventricular depolarisation is concentration-dependent with a QRS duration &gt;150 msec independently highly predictive of mortality in chloroquine self-poisoning. Pharmacokinetic modelling predicts that most high dose regimens trialled in COVID-19 are unlikely to cause serious cardiovascular toxicity.","Watson, Tarning, Hoglund, Baud, Megarbane, Clemessy, White","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58631","20200708","human; human biology; medicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 in a Los Angeles Health System","With the continuing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic coupled with phased reopening, it is critical to identify risk factors associated with susceptibility and severity of disease in a diverse population to help shape government policies, guide clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research. In this retrospective case-control study, we used de-identified electronic health records (EHR) from the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) Health System between March 9th, 2020 and June 14th, 2020 to identify risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility (severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR test positive), inpatient admission, and severe outcomes (treatment in an intensive care unit or intubation). Of the 26,602 individuals tested by PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 992 were COVID-19 positive (3.7% of Tested), 220 were admitted in the hospital (22% of COVID-19 positive), and 77 had a severe outcome (35% of Inpatient). Consistent with previous studies, males and individuals older than 65 years old had increased risk of inpatient admission. Notably, individuals self-identifying as Hispanic or Latino constituted an increasing percentage of COVID-19 patients as disease severity escalated, comprising 24% of those testing positive, but 40% of those with a severe outcome, a disparity that remained after correcting for medical co-morbidities. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and renal disease were premorbid risk factors present before SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing associated with COVID-19 susceptibility. Less well-established risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility included pre-existing dementia (odds ratio (OR) 5.2 [3.2-8.3], p=2.6 x 10-10), mental health conditions (depression OR 2.1 [1.6-2.8], p=1.1 x 10-6) and vitamin D deficiency (OR 1.8 [1.4-2.2], p=5.7 x 10-6). Renal diseases including end-stage renal disease and anemia due to chronic renal disease were the predominant premorbid risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission. Other less established risk factors for COVID-19 inpatient admission included previous renal transplant (OR 9.7 [2.8-39], p=3.2x10-4) and disorders of the immune system (OR 6.0 [2.3, 16], p=2.7x10-4). Prior use of oral steroid medications was associated with decreased COVID-19 positive testing risk (OR 0.61 [0.45, 0.81], p=4.3x10-4), but increased inpatient admission risk (OR 4.5 [2.3, 8.9], p=1.8x10-5). We did not observe that prior use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased the risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, being admitted to the hospital, or having a severe outcome. This study involving direct EHR extraction identified known and less well-established demographics, and prior diagnoses and medications as risk factors for COVID-19 susceptibility and inpatient admission. Knowledge of these risk factors including marked ethnic disparities observed in disease severity should guide government policies, identify at-risk populations, inform clinical decision making, and prioritize future COVID-19 research.","Chang, Ding, Freund, Johnson, Schwarz, Yabu, Hazlett, Chiang, Wulf, Geschwind, Butte, Pasaniuc","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.03.20145581","20200724",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The mental health of health care workers in Oman during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 disease is one of the most destructive events that humanity has witnessed in the 21st century. It has impacted all aspects of life and all segments of populations, including already vulnerable health care providers. This study sought to detect the prevalence of mental health issues in sample of physicians and nurses working in several health facilities in Oman. We gauged the mental health conditions of 509 physicians (38.1%) and nurses (61.9 %) using the Perceived Stress Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale and World Health Organization Well-Being Index. The study revealed a high prevalence of stress, anxiety and poor psychological well-being, especially among females, young health care workers and those who interacted with known or suspected COVID-19 patients. The outcomes of this study support the handful of studies published during this global health crisis that have found that the mental health of health care workers has been harshly affected and predicted that it will continue, to various degrees, to be affected in the foreseeable future.

"Secondary Traumatization Outcomes and Associated Factors Among the Health Care Workers Exposed to the COVID-19","Secondary traumatization exposure and mental health conditions of health care workers gained importance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic period. In our study, we aim to research the secondary traumatization and associated factors among health care workers. This cross-sectional study was applied through an online questionnaire using the snowball sampling method. Two hundred fifty-one health care workers from different units/services and 312 non-medical worker adults attended to the research. Health care workers were divided into two groups based on working with COVID-19 patients at the frontline or not. The data were collected via Introductory Information Form, Secondary Traumatic Stress Scale (STSS) and Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4) between 22 May and 30 May 2020. Among the 563 participants, 251 (44.6%) were health care workers and 312 (55.4%) were non-medical workers. The anxiety, depression and secondary traumatization scores of the frontline health care workers for the COVID-19 were found to be significantly higher than those of the other health workers or non-medical workers (<i>p</i>â€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Also, we found that being a woman, being in the first years of the work, living with a parent, having a chronic disease, having a trauma history and increased social media use are related to having higher scores from the secondary traumatization scale. The secondary traumatization exposure and the mental health conditions of the health care workers directly working with the COVID-19 patients should be taken into consideration. It is important to provide social support, examine and control riskier groups for mental health regularly during the pandemic.","Arpacioglu, Gurler, Cakiroglu","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940742","20200711","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health care workers; risk factors; secondary traumatization","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Self-Control Moderates the Association Between Perceived Severity of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and Mental Health Problems Among the Chinese Public","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused thousands of deaths in China. Prior research suggests that individuals' perceived severity of COVID-19 is related to a range of negative emotional and behavioral reactions among the Chinese public. However, scant research has examined the underlying mechanisms. Drawing upon the risk-resilience model, this study proposes that self-control, as a resilient factor, would potentially moderate the association between perceived severity of COVID-19 and mental health problems. Data from a national survey was used to examine this idea. Participants were 4607 citizens from 31 regions in China (M<sub>age</sub> = 23.71 years, 72.5% female) who completed a national survey at the beginning of February 2020. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for a number of demographic variables, perceived severity of COVID-19 and self-control were positively and negatively related to mental health problems, respectively. More importantly, self-control moderated the &quot;perceived severity of COVID-19-mental health problems&quot; association, with this link attenuating as the levels of self-control increased. These findings suggest that compared to those with high self-control, individuals with low self-control are more vulnerable and are more in need of psychological aids to maintain mental health in the encounter of the COVID-19 outbreak. Practically, enhancing individuals' self-control ability might be a promising way to improve individuals' mental health during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Yang, Dou, Cheung","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134820","20200717","COVID-19; cognitive appraisal; public health concerns; resilience; risk factor; self-control; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Self-Control; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The present study investigated the fear of psychotherapists to become infected with COVID-19 during psychotherapy in personal contact and assessed how the provision of psychotherapy changed due to the COVID-19 situation and whether there were differences with regard to country and gender. Psychotherapists from three European countries: Czech Republic (CZ, <i>n</i> = 112), Germany (DE, <i>n</i> = 130) and Slovakia (SK, <i>n</i> = 96), with on average 77.8% female participants, completed an online survey. Participants rated the fear of COVID-19 infection during face-to-face psychotherapy and reported the number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via internet) during the COVID-19 situation as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. Fear of COVID-19 infection was highest in SK and lowest in DE (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and was higher in female compared to male psychotherapists (<i>p</i> = 0.021). In all countries, the number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and remote psychotherapies increased (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), with more patients being treated via internet than via telephone during the COVID-19 situation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, female psychotherapists treated less patients in personal contact (<i>p</i> = 0.036), while they treated more patients via telephone than their male colleagues (<i>p</i> = 0.015). Overall, the total number of patients treated did not differ during COVID-19 from the months before (<i>p</i> = 0.133) and psychotherapy in personal contact remained the most common treatment modality. Results imply that the supply of mental health care could be maintained during COVID-19 and that changes in the provision of psychotherapy vary among countries and gender.","Humer, Pieh, Kuska, Barke, Doering, Gossmann, Trnka, Meier, Kascakova, Tavel, Probst","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134811","20200717","COVID-19; fear of infection; psychotherapy; public health; remote psychotherapy; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Czech Republic; Fear; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotherapy; Slovakia; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact of COVID-19 on gaming disorder: Monitoring and prevention","The global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has necessitated physical distancing, lockdown, contact tracing, and self-quarantine so as to prevent the spread of the disease. Amid the outbreak, gaming data usage has reportedly increased in the United States, and game download volume has reached a record high in Europe. Because gaming can be used to cope with the psychological stress from the outbreak, therefore mental health professionals should be aware of how increased gaming during the pandemic may contribute to risk of gaming disorder, especially if the pandemic persists. Mental health professionals should thus formulate safe social interaction alternatives for people, particularly adolescents, who have gaming disorder risk.","Ko, Yen","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2020.00040","20200707","COVID-19; adolescents; gaming disorder; physical distancing; psychological impact","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Pediatric mental and behavioral health in the period of quarantine and social distancing (COVID-19)","The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly throughout the world and has generated a long-term impact. The pandemic has caused great harm to society and also caused serious psychological trauma to many people. Pediatrics are a vulnerable group in this global public health emergency, as their nervous systems, endocrine systems and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes are not well developed. Psychological crises often cause pediatrics to produce feelings of abandonment, despair, incapacity and exhaustion, and even raising the risk of suicide. Children with mental illnesses are especially vulnerable during the quarantine and social distancing period. The inclusion of psychosocial support for pediatrics and their families are part of the health responses to disaster and disaster recovery. Based on the bio-psycho-social model, some pediatrics may have catastrophic thoughts and are prone to experience despair, numbness, flashback and other serious emotional and behavioral reactions. In severe cases, there may be symptoms of psychosis or post-traumatic stress disorder. Timely and appropriate protections are needed to prevent the occurrence of psychological and behavioral problems. The emerging digital applications and health services such as telehealth, social media, mobile health and remote interactive online education are able to bridge the social distance and support mental and behavioral health for pediatric populations. Based on the psychological development characteristics of pediatrics, this study also illustrates interventions on the psychological impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the world has been struggling to curb the influences of the pandemic, the quarantine and social distancing policies will have long-term impacts on pediatrics. Innovative digital solutions and informatics tools are needed more than ever to mitigate the negative consequences on pediatrics. Healthcare delivery and services should envision and implement innovative paradigms to meet broad well-being needs and pediatric health as the quarantine and social distancing over a longer term become a new reality. Future research on pediatric mental and behavioral health should pay more attention to novel solutions that incorporate cutting edge interactive technologies and digital approaches, leveraging considerable advances in pervasive and ubiquitous computing, human-computer interaction, health informatics and among many others. Digital approaches, health technologies and informatics are supposed to be designed and implemented to support public health surveillance and critical responses to pediatrics' growth and development. For instance, human-computer interactions, augmented reality and virtual reality could be incorporated to remote psychological supporting service for pediatric health; mobile technologies could be used to monitor pediatrics' mental and behavioral health while protecting their individual privacy; big data and artificial intelligences could be utilized to support decision-making on whether pediatrics should go out for physical activities and whether schools should be reopened, etc. Implications to clinical practice, psychological therapeutic practices and future research directions to address current efforts gaps have been highlighted.","Ye","https://doi.org/10.2196/19867","20200707",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Risk, resilience, psychological distress, and anxiety at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany","The current COVID-19 pandemic comes with multiple psychological stressors due to health-related, social, economic, and individual consequences and may cause psychological distress. The aim of this study was to screen the population in Germany for negative impact on mental health in the current COVID-19 pandemic and to analyze possible risk and protective factors. A total of 6,509 people took part in an online survey in Germany from 27 March to 6 April. The questionnaire included demographic information and ascertained psychological distress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and risk and protective factors. In our sample, over 50% expressed suffering from anxiety and psychological distress regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants spent several hours per day thinking about COVID-19 (MÂ =Â 4.45). Psychological and social determinants showed stronger associations with anxiety regarding COVID-19 than experiences with the disease. The current COVID-19 pandemic does cause psychological distress, anxiety, and depression for large proportions of the general population. Strategies such as maintaining a healthy lifestyle and social contacts, acceptance of anxiety and negative emotions, fostering self-efficacy, and information on where to get medical treatment if needed, seem of help, while substance abuse and suppression of anxiety and negative emotions seem to be associated with more psychological burden.","Petzold, Bendau, Plag, Pyrkosch, Mascarell Maricic, Betzler, Rogoll, GroÃŸe, StrÃ¶hle","https://doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1745","20200717","adjustment disorders; anxiety/anxiety disorders; coping; corona; depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A nation-wide survey on emotional and psychological impacts of COVID-19 social distancing","Social distancing is crucial in order to flatten the curve of COVID-19 virus spreading. Isolation, scarcity of resources and the lack of social contacts may have produced a negative impact on people's emotions and psychological well-being. This study aims to explore the reasons and the ways through which social distancing generates negative emotions in individuals who experienced the lockdown. To a larger extent, the objective is to check the existence of relations between negative emotions and the satisfaction of basic needs. In Italy 140,656 online interviews were collected from March 22 to April 2, 2020. Data analysis was carried out using mono and bivariate statistical analysis, K-means clustering and the Principal Components Analysis (PCA). The parameters for the identification of six clusters were: the intensity of the respondent's basic emotions and the layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. The majority of people involved in an emergency situation, implying a collapse of social contacts, experience some kind of emotional reactions. In our study, we found a correlation between basic emotions and Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In times of crisis, the most basic needs are the physiological ones. Fear, anger and sadness are predominant in all population groups; anger and disgust mainly appear when people are exposed to the risk of not being able to meet subsistence needs, thus perceiving a lack of economic security. The well-known Maslow's theory of human needs seems to fit well with the outbreak of negative emotions in the context of COVID-19. This study demonstrates the existence of links between negative emotions and primary needs that mainly refer to the first three levels of Maslow's pyramid. As a result of COVID-19 worldwide pandemic, many people have been sucked into the bottom layers of the pyramid. This change in individual basic needs has triggered a relevant transformation in individual emotional status and a shift towards negative emotions.","Cerbara, Ciancimino, Crescimbene, La Longa, Parsi, Tintori, Palomba","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202006_21711","20200710","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Female; Humans; Internet; Italy; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Behavior; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 pandemic lockdown: An emotional health perspective of Indians on Twitter","Novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) has spread in the world since its first human infection in December 2019. India has also witnessed a rising number of infections since March 2020. The Indian government imposed lockdowns in the nation to control the movement of its citizens thereby confining the spread of the virus. Tweeters resorted to usage of social media platform to express their mind. Through this article, an attempt has been made to understand the mind-set of Indian people using Python and R statistical software, during the recent lockdown 2.0 (15 April 2020 to 3 May 2020) and lockdown 3.0 (4 May 2020 to 17 May 2020) through their tweets on the social media platform Twitter. Also, opinion on e-commerce during this pandemic has been analysed. Analysis has been performed using Python and R statistical software. Also, recent articles related to COVID-19 have been considered and reviewed. Although the country had a positive approach in lockdown 2.0 with only few instances of sadness, disgust and others, the majority of the people had a negative approach in lockdown 3.0. This analysis can help the health specialists to understand people's mind-set, the authorities to take further corresponding measures in washing out the virus and the e-commerce stakeholders to adapt to the changing attitudes by adjusting demand and supply plans accordingly.","Chehal, Gupta, Gulati","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020940741","20200710","COVID-19; Twitter; e-commerce; human behaviour; lockdown; opinion mining","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Maintaining High-Quality Multidisciplinary Pain Medicine Fellowship Programs: Part I: Innovations in Pain Fellows' Education, Research, Applicant Selection Process, Wellness, and ACGME Implementation During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Pain fellowship programs are facing unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions from state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for todays' fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to guarantee that proper education is maintained and to ensure the well-being of our trainees. We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors to provide guidance and formulate recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationally. This guidance is based on reviewing current changes to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board of Anesthesiology policies and best available evidence and expert opinion on the use of remote educational activities, research endeavors, and trainee wellness. The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been severe and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Understanding revisions to ACGME policies, using technology to promote remote learning opportunities, and providing trainees with opportunities to alleviate their anxiety and encourage mental health are beneficial strategies to implement. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to help overcome these challenges.","Kohan, Moeschler, Spektor, Przkora, Sobey, Brancolini, Wahezi, Anitescu","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa168","20200709","Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education Telehealth; COVID-19; Competency; Fellowship Program; Pain Management; Pandemic; Wellness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation","With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have been forced to follow strict social isolation guidelines. While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt.Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.","Dhont, Di Tella, Dubois, Aznar, Petit, SpaÅ‚ek, Boldrini, Franco, Bertholet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006","20200708","COVID-19; HADS; Isolation; Mental health; Research","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on public mental health. Therefore, monitoring and oversight of the population mental health during crises such as a panedmic is an immediate priority. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing research works and findings in relation to the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, articles that have focused on stress and anxiety prevalence among the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic were searched in the Science Direct, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases, without a lower time limit and until May 2020. In order to perform a meta-analysis of the collected studies, the random effects model was used, and the heterogeneity of studies was investigated using the I<sup>2</sup> index. Moreover. data analysis was conducted using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) software. The prevalence of stress in 5 studies with a total sample size of 9074 is obtained as 29.6% (95% confidence limit: 24.3-35.4), the prevalence of anxiety in 17 studies with a sample size of 63,439 as 31.9% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-36.7), and the prevalence of depression in 14 studies with a sample size of 44,531 people as 33.7% (95% confidence interval: 27.5-40.6). COVID-19 not only causes physical health concerns but also results in a number of psychological disorders. The spread of the new coronavirus can impact the mental health of people in different communities. Thus, it is essential to preserve the mental health of individuals and to develop psychological interventions that can improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Salari, Hosseinian-Far, Jalali, Vaisi-Raygani, Rasoulpoor, Mohammadi, Rasoulpoor, Khaledi-Paveh","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00589-w","20200709","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; General population; Meta-analysis; Prevalence; Stress; Systematic review; Anxiety; Asia; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Europe; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Augmenting Evidence-Based Care With a Texting Mobile Interventionist: A Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial","This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and clinical utility of training intensive psychiatric community care team members to serve as &quot;mobile interventionists&quot; who engage patients in recovery-oriented texting exchanges. A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare the mobile interventionist approach as an add-on to assertive community treatment (ACT) versus ACT alone. Participants were 49 individuals with serious mental illness (62% with schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder, 24% with bipolar disorder, and 14% with depression). Clinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up, and satisfaction was evaluated posttreatment. The intervention appeared feasible (95% of participants assigned to the mobile interventionist arm initiated the intervention, texting on 69% of possible days and averaging four messages per day), acceptable (91% reported satisfaction), and safe (no adverse events reported). Exploratory posttreatment clinical effect estimations suggested greater reductions in the severity of paranoid thoughts (Cohen's d=-0.61) and depression (d=-0.59) and improved illness management (d=0.31) and recovery (d=0.23) in the mobile interventionist group. Augmentation of care with a texting mobile interventionist proved to be feasible, acceptable, safe, and clinically promising. The findings are encouraging given the relative ease of training practitioners to serve as mobile interventionists, the low burden placed on patients and practitioners, and the simplicity of the technology. The technical resources are widely accessible to patients and practitioners, boding well for potential intervention scalability. When pandemics such as COVID-19 block the possibility of in-person patient-provider contact, evidence-based texting interventions can serve a crucial role in supporting continuity of care.","Ben-Zeev, Buck, Meller, Hudenko, Hallgren","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202000239","20200707","assertive community treatment; bipolar disorder; depression; digital interventions; mHealth; schizophrenia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Effects of Covid-19 Lockdown on Mental Health and Sleep Disturbances in Italy","Italy was the first European country that entered a nationwide lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since quarantine can impact on mental health, this study aimed to estimate the prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and sleeping disturbances in the Italian population during lockdown. The factors that might influence such outcomes were explored. A national cross-sectional survey was performed during the last 14 days of the Italian lockdown. Questionnaires assessed socio-demographics characteristic, behaviors and healthcare access. The outcomes were assessed using Patient Health Questionnaire-2 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2. Participants with sleep disturbances completed the Insomnia Severity Index. The sample size was 1515. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderate/severe insomnia. Being female, an increased time spent on the internet and an avoidance of activities through peer pressure increased the likelihood of at least one mental health outcome. Increasing age, an absence of work-related troubles and being married or being a cohabitant reduced such a probability. Females and participants with chronic conditions were associated with a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances. It is crucial to study effective interventions, specifically planning strategies, for more vulnerable groups and to consider the role of the internet.","Gualano, Lo Moro, Voglino, Bert, Siliquini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134779","20200717","anxiety; depression; patient health questionnaire; quarantine; sleep wake disorders; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Sleep Wake Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Through collection of 2132 questionnaire responses in field research, the present researchers analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and various approaches. In conclusion, the public's high level of willingness to share information, sufficient knowledge of and consensus on epidemic prevention between individuals and families, strict compliance with relevant regulations, effective preventive measures, and adequate public facilities have contributed to control of COVID-19. However, vigilance and awareness of the pandemic in some individuals, epidemic-prevention campaigns, and community-based preventive measures were insufficient. Some citizens subsequently suffered from headaches, anxiety, and mood instability. Furthermore, demographic variables (place of residence, sex, age, and occupation) and physical and mental health status produced various effects on citizens' awareness, attitude, and behavior regarding epidemic prevention as well as the perceived effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health.","Hsu, Lin, Wang, Jhang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134694","20200722","Coronavirus Disease 2019; Taiwan; prevention measures","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Strategies to Increase Peer Support Specialists' Capacity to Use Digital Technology in the Era of COVID-19: Pre-Post Study","Prior to the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), telemental health to support mental health services was primarily designed for individuals with professional clinical degrees, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, registered nurses, and licensed clinical social workers. For the first the time in history, peer support specialists are offering Medicaid-reimbursable telemental health services during the COVID-19 crisis; however, little effort has been made to train peer support specialists on telehealth practice and delivery. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use digital peer support technology. The Digital Peer Support Certification was co-produced with peer support specialists and included an education and simulation training session, synchronous and asynchronous support services, and audit and feedback. Participants included 9 certified peer support specialists between the ages of 25 and 54 years (mean 39 years) who were employed as peer support specialists for 1 to 11 years (mean 4.25 years) and had access to a work-funded smartphone device and data plan. A pre-post design was implemented to examine the impact of the Digital Peer Support Certification on peer support specialists' capacity to use technology over a 3-month timeframe. Data were collected at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. Overall, an upward trend in peer support specialists' capacity to offer digital peer support occurred during the 3-month certification period. The Digital Peer Support Certification shows promising evidence of increasing the capacity of peer support specialists to use specific digital peer support technology features. Our findings also highlighted that this capacity was less likely to increase with training alone and that a combinational knowledge translation approach that includes both training and management will be more successful.","Fortuna, Myers, Walsh, Walker, Mois, Brooks","https://doi.org/10.2196/20429","20200724","COVID-19; mental health; peer support; telemental health; training","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID stress syndrome: Concept, structure, and correlates","Research shows that the COVID Stress Scales have a robust multifactorial structure, representing five correlated facets of COVID-19-related distress: (a) Fear of the dangerousness of COVID-19, which includes fear of coming into contact with fomites potentially contaminated with SARSCoV2, (b) worry about socioeconomic costs of COVID-19 (e.g., worry about personal finances and disruption in the supply chain), (c) xenophobic fears that foreigners are spreading SARSCoV2, (d) traumatic stress symptoms associated with direct or vicarious traumatic exposure to COVID-19 (nightmares, intrusive thoughts, or images related to COVID-19), and (e) COVID-19-related compulsive checking and reassurance seeking. These factors cohere to form a COVID stress syndrome, which we sought to further delineate in the present study. A population-representative sample of 6,854 American and Canadian adults completed a self-report survey comprising questions about current mental health and COVID-19-related experiences, distress, and coping. Network analysis revealed that worry about the dangerousness of COVID-19 is the central feature of the syndrome. Latent class analysis indicated that the syndrome is quasi-dimensional, comprising five classes differing in syndrome severity. Sixteen percent of participants were in the most severe class and possibly needing mental health services. Syndrome severity was correlated with preexisting psychopathology and with excessive COVID-19-related avoidance, panic buying, and coping difficulties during self-isolation. The findings provide new information about the structure and correlates of COVID stress syndrome. Further research is needed to determine whether the syndrome will abate once the pandemic has passed or whether, for some individuals, it becomes a chronic condition.","Taylor, Landry, Paluszek, Fergus, McKay, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1002/da.23071","20200717","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; fear; pandemic; stress; xenophobia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological Symptoms During the Two Stages of Lockdown in Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak: An Investigation in a Sample of Citizens in Northern Spain","Spain has been in a state of emergency since 14th March due to the COVID-19 crisis. This state of emergency means that the population must comply with strict rules such as lockdown (confinement to their homes except for essential trips) and social distancing. The aim of this study was to examine the psychological state of the general population in a sample recruited in Northern Spain. Sociodemographic and psychological data were gathered, assessing variables such as stress, anxiety, and depression. A questionnaire was administered at the beginning of the lockdown and three weeks later. The sample was recruited using an online questionnaire by means of a non-probabilistic snowball sampling methodology. A total of 1,933 people participated in this study. The results reveal that more than a quarter of the participants have reported symptoms of depression (27.5%), anxiety (26.9%) and stress (26.5%) and as the time spent in lockdown has progressed, psychological symptoms have risen. In relation to gender, data indicate that men have higher levels of depression than women, and similar levels of anxiety and stress.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in Guangdong, China: a cross-sectional study","During previous pandemic outbreaks, medical staff have reported high levels of psychological distress. The aim of the current study was to report a snapshot of the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its correlated factors on medical staff in Guangdong, China. On the 2nd and 3rd February 2020, soon after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we surveyed medical staff at four hospitals in Guangdong, China, to collect demographic characteristics, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores. Complete responses were received from 1045 medical staff. Respondents were divided into high- and low-risk groups according to their working environment of contacting with potential or confirmed COVID-19 cases. The proportion of staff with anxiety (55.4% v. 43.0%, p &lt; 0.001) or depression (43.6% v. 36.8%, p = 0.028) was significantly higher in the high-risk group than the low-risk group. The percentage of staff with severe anxiety was similar in the two groups. Doctors were more susceptible to moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms. The high-risk group had higher levels of clinical insomnia (13.5% v. 8.5%, p = 0.011) and were more likely to be in the upper quartile for stress symptoms (24.7% v. 19.3%, p = 0.037) than the low-risk group. Additionally, work experience negatively correlated with insomnia symptoms. It is important for hospitals and authorities to protect both the physical and psychological health of medical staff during times of pandemic, even those with a low exposure risk.","Wang, Huang, Huang, Zhang, Guo, Liu, Ma, Geng","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720002561","20200723","Anxiety; COVID-19; coronavirus disease 2019; medical staff; psychological status","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Cancer, immune suppression and Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19): Need to manage drug safety (French Society for Oncology Pharmacy [SFPO] guidelines)","The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is disrupting our health environment. As expected, studies highlighted the great susceptibility of cancer patients to COVID-19 and more severe complications, leading oncologists to deeply rethink patient cancer care. This review is dedicated to the optimization of care pathways and therapeutics in cancer patients during the pandemic and aims to discuss successive issues. First we focused on the international guidelines proposing adjustments and alternative options to cancer care in order to limit hospital admission and cytopenic treatment in cancer patients, most of whom are immunocompromised. In addition cancer patients are prone to polypharmacy, enhancing the risk of drug-related problems as adverse events and drug-drug interactions. Due to increased risk in case of COVID-19, we reported a comprehensive review of all the drug-related problems between COVID-19 and antineoplastics. Moreover, in the absence of approved drug against COVID-19, infected patients may be included in clinical trials evaluating new drugs with a lack of knowledge, particularly in cancer patients. Focusing on the several experimental drugs currently being evaluated, we set up an original data board helping oncologists and pharmacists to identify promptly drug-related problems between antineoplastics and experimental drugs. Finally additional and concrete recommendations are provided, supporting oncologists and pharmacists in their efforts to manage cancer patients and to optimize their treatments in this new era related to COVID-19.","Slimano, Baudouin, Zerbit, Toulemonde-Deldicque, Thomas-Schoemann, Chevrier, Daouphars, Madelaine, Pourroy, Tournamille, Astier, Ranchon, Cazin, Bardin, Rioufol","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctrv.2020.102063","20200717","COVID-19; Clinical trials; Drug safety; Drug-drug interactions; Drug-related problems; Herb-Drug interactions; Immune depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The response of the mental health network of the Salamanca area to the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of the telemedicine","The COVID-19 pandemic reached world-wide causing a great impact on healthcare services. The aim of this work is to describe the response of the Mental Health Network of the SalamancaÂ´ Area (Spain) to this crisis and the reorganization of its resources within the first 8 weeks after the state of alarm was declared. The Psychiatry Service applied a contingency plan which included the reorganization of the human resources, the closure of some of the units and the implementation of telemedicine programs along with two specific programs, namely a mental health assistance program in the context of the infection by coronavirus, and another program for homeless people. 9.038 phone interviews were carried out in the outpatients and community mental health programs. The activity in subacute and acute wards, as well as that of the day hospital programs was decreased to 50%. Based on that this real-world response provided we concluded that the usage of telemedicine is promising in patients with any kind of disorder. Its implementation in daily practice will be considered in the future.

"Considerations for people with diabetes during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic","The severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to cause havoc globally, resulting in unprecedented healthcare, societal and economic disruption. People with diabetes have been shown to be at higher risk of complications and death when exposed to pneumonia, influenza and other coronaviruses. Despite pandemic scale infection, there is currently limited understanding on the potential impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on people with diabetes. (1) To characterise the outcomes of COVID-19 for people with diabetes and (2) add value to current recommendations for healthcare providers and people with diabetes to encourage optimal management. A search of PubMed, Embase and MEDLINE to March 2020 was undertaken, using search terms pertaining to diabetes, coronavirus and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We briefly reviewed the epidemiology and pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of diabetes. People with diabetes are at greater risk of severe infection and death with COVID-19. COVID-19 has significantly impacted the daily lives of individuals living with diabetes through financial implications, food and medication scarcity and its burden on mental health. In Australia, delivery of medical care has been adapted to reduce the risk of transmission, with a particular emphasis on telehealth and remote monitoring.","Sacks, Pham, Fleming, Neoh, Ekinci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.diabres.2020.108296","20200724","Coronavirus; Diabetes","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on a sample of Spanish health professionals","After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.","Dosil SantamarÃ­a, Ozamiz-Etxebarria, Redondo RodrÃ­guez, Jaureguizar Alboniga-Mayor, Picaza Gorrotxategi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004","20200707","Ansiedad; Anxiety; COVID-19; DepresiÃ³n; Depression; Health proffesionals; Insomnia; Insomnio; Personal sanitario","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents' individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.","Guessoum, Lachal, Radjack, Carretier, Minassian, Benoit, Moro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264","20200707","Adolescent; Covid-19; Depression; Mental disorder; Pandemic; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Problems of mental health in the situation of COVID-19 pandemic]","The WHO declared COVID-19 pandemic, the deterioration of the epidemic situation in Russia, the lockdown and the growing fear in society caused by panic rumors and misinformation spread on social networks and the media pose urgent organizational and medical tasks for our psychiatric service. Based on the experience of other countries that have already encountered the massive spread of COVID-19, the author presents a review of the proposed urgent and preventive organizational and treatment measures and suggests practical recommendations on urgent temporary reorganization of the psychiatric service, and the provision of psychological and psychotherapeutic support to the most vulnerable groups of the population, including medical personnel working with patients with COVID-19, and the management of mentally ill patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. As the primary goals, it is proposed to separate the flows of people in need of psychological support and psychiatric care, and organize the remote provision of these services (hotline phones and telemedicine consultations). Particular attention is paid to the management of mentally ill patients with coronavirus respiratory syndrome and the characteristics of psychopharmacological therapy with an overview of the potential risks of side-effects and complications related primarily to respiratory function, including those due to adverse drug interactions.

"Infidelity in the Time of COVID-19","Infidelity occurs in approximately 25% of marriages and is associated with various negative consequences for individuals (e.g., depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress), the couple relationship (e.g., financial loss, increased conflict and aggression), and the couple's children (e.g., internalizing and externalizing behaviors). Infidelity is also one of the most frequently cited reasons for divorce. The increased stress brought on by the pandemic may be putting couples at an increased risk for experiencing infidelity and data collected during the pandemic have shown that people across the United States are engaging in behaviors that are associated with a high likelihood of experiencing infidelity. The negative consequences of infidelity are also likely to be exacerbated for couples during the pandemic due to the intersection with the social, emotional, and financial consequences of COVID-19. Furthermore, couples are likely to experience disruptions and delays to the affair recovery process during the pandemic, which can negatively impact their ability to heal. Therefore, recommendations for navigating affair recovery during the pandemic, including adaptations for therapy, are also discussed.","Coop Gordon, Mitchell","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12576","20200717",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Covid-19 pandemic seen from the frontline","COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus produces respiratory symptoms, predominantly of the upper airways, which can progress to pneumonia after 7 days with persistent fever, cough and dyspnea, and even develop a syndrome of acute respiratory distress (ARDS), multi-organ failure and death. Since COVID-19 disease was declared by the WHO there has been a redistribution of the healthcare system for these types of patients, especially in the front line, which is, in primary care, emergencies and in intensive care units (ICU). In primary care, the fundamental role is the diagnosis of the suspected patients, follow-up mainly by telemedicine (specially telephone calls) to detect warning signs in case of worsening and subsequent referral to the emergency department; as well as explaining home isolation measures. In the emergency department, it is included the management of suspicious cases and, if it any risk factor is found, complementary tests are carried out for precise diagnosis and admission assessment; In case of oxygen saturation &lt;95% and poor general condition, valuation is requested for admission to the ICU. Depending on the severity of the patient, he/she would be or not a candidate for invasive mechanical ventilation, which must be performed by trained personnel to prevent the spread of the infection minimizing the risk of contagion. ARDS's treatment strategies include pulmonary protection ventilation, prone position, recruitment maneuvers and, less frequently, oxygenation by extracorporeal membrane. Among the specific treatments for COVID-19 stand out mainly drugs to reduce viral load, although sometimes specific drugs will be needed to treat hyperinflammation, hypercoagulability and concomitant infections. One of the goals to be achieved is for patients to recover and be able to successfully return to work; for this purpose, an adequate physical and psychological rehabilitation program is essential, as about 50% have symptoms of anxiety and depression.","Carmona, Nielfa, Alvarado","https://doi.org/10.1590/S1677-5538.IBJU.2020.S123","20200715"," Emergencies; Primary Health Care; spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 [Supplementary Concept] ","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Emerging public health challenge in UK: perception and belief on increased COVID19 death among BAME healthcare workers","Coronavirus infection Disease 19 impacted every part of the world and routine life. Recent report from the Office of national statistics in UK reported disproportionate death among Black Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) population. NHS is heavily relied on the BAME work force both in front line and in the community. We attempted to explore the beliefs and perception about reported worrying issue among BAME health work force in a Diverse city of Leicester. This is a cross-sectional survey using 20 questions in an electronic format. The target population was identified through Leicester Asian Doctors Society and Leicester Asian Nurses Society. The questionnaire was then distributed electronically to the members. Survey questionnaire was accessed by 372, incomplete response (172) were excluded and 200 completed responses were analysed. Majority of BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line duties. More than 70% were anxious about their role during this pandemic. The Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supply was adequate, and the support received from the local healthcare providers was more than satisfactory. The work force perceived co-morbidity, lack of PPE and testing were one of the few reasons for increased death in BAME. BAME group felt adequate provision of PPE, increased testing and improving mental health well-being is required to alleviate concerns and improve BAME working life in NHS. BAME workforce are routinely involved in front line work and current anxiety level is very high. Adequate provision of mental health support with clear risk stratification for return to work is required urgently.","Moorthy, Sankar","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa096","20200709","BAME group; BAME health workers; COVID 19; death; healthcare workers","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mood, anxiety and olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19: evidence of central nervous system involvement?","The objective of this study was to determine the burden of depressed mood and anxiety in COVID-19, and associated disease characteristics. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study of 114 COVID-19 positive patients diagnosed using RT-PCR-based testing over a 6-week period. The 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-2) were used to measure depressed mood and anxiety level, respectively, at enrollment and for participants' baseline, pre-COVID-19 state. Severity of smell loss, loss of taste, nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea/mucus production, fever, cough and shortness of breath (SOB) during COVID-19 were assessed. PHQ-2 and GAD-2 significantly (p&lt;0.001) increased from baseline to enrollment. PHQ-2 was associated with smell loss (adjusted incidence rate ratio [aIRR]=1.40, 95%CI: 1.10-1.78, p=0.006), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.006), and baseline PHQ-2 score (aIRR=1.39, 95%CI: 1.09-1.76, p=0.007). GAD-2 score was associated with smell loss (aIRR=1.29, 95%CI: 1.02-1.62, p=0.035), age (aIRR=1.02, 95%CI: 1.01-1.04, p=0.025) and baseline GAD-2 score (aIRR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.24-1.93, p&lt;0.001). Loss of taste also exhibited similar associations with PHQ-2 and GAD-2. PHQ-2 and GAD-2 scores were not associated with severities of any other symptoms during the COVID-19 course. Despite the occurrence of symptoms-such as SOB-associated with severe manifestations of COVID-19, only the severities of smell and taste loss were associated with depressed mood and anxiety. These results may raise the novel possibility of emotional disturbance as a CNS manifestation of COVID-19 given trans-olfactory tract penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) by coronaviruses.","Speth, Singer-Cornelius, Oberle, Gengler, Brockmeier, Sedaghat","https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.28964","20200717","COVID-19; Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV2; anosmia; anxiety; depression; gustatory dysfunction; gustatory function; hyposmia; mood; nasal obstruction; olfaction; olfactory dysfunction; olfactory function; rhinorrhea; smell; taste","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19: unravelling the clinical progression of nature's virtually perfect biological weapon","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has shocked the world and caused morbidity and mortality on an unprecedented level in the era of modern medicine. Evidence generated to-date on the virulence and pathogenicity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suggests that COVID-19 may be considered a perfect storm, caused by a nature's virtually perfect biological weapon. This conclusion is supported by an updated analysis of pathogenesis and clinical progression of this infectious disease. It is now readily apparent that COVID-19 is not a clear-cut disorder, but is instead a gradually evolving pathology, characterized by a series of stages sustained by different molecular and biological mechanisms. The disease can hence be divided in at least five different phases (incubation, respiratory, pro-inflammatory, pro-thrombotic, and death or remission). Whilst the virus triggers direct cytopathic injury during the initial stage of illness, in the following evolving phases, it is the host itself that undergoes an almost suicidal reaction, sustained, amplified and maintained by the immune, complement and hemostatic systems. Another peculiar property making SARS-CoV-2 a devious and vicious pathogen is the biophysical structure of its receptor biding domain, which needs to be primed by human proteases, thus being less efficiently targetable by the host immune system. The unique pathophysiology of COVID-19 requires the customization of therapy by individual patient characteristics and according to the phase-specific, evolving derangement of the multiple biological pathways.","Lippi, Sanchis-Gomar, Henry","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3989","20200704","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); coagulation; coronavirus; inflammation; pathogenesis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19): an evidence map of medical literature","Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a substantial body of COVID-19 medical literature has been generated. As of June 2020, gaps and longitudinal trends in the COVID-19 medical literature remain unidentified, despite potential benefits for research prioritisation and policy setting in both the COVID-19 pandemic and future large-scale public health crises. In this paper, we searched PubMed and Embase for medical literature on COVID-19 between 1 January and 24 March 2020. We characterised the growth of the early COVID-19 medical literature using evidence maps and bibliometric analyses to elicit cross-sectional and longitudinal trends and systematically identify gaps. The early COVID-19 medical literature originated primarily from Asia and focused mainly on clinical features and diagnosis of the disease. Many areas of potential research remain underexplored, such as mental health, the use of novel technologies and artificial intelligence, pathophysiology of COVID-19 within different body systems, and indirect effects of COVID-19 on the care of non-COVID-19 patients. Few articles involved research collaboration at the international level (24.7%). The median submission-to-publication duration was 8 days (interquartile range: 4-16). Although in its early phase, COVID-19 research has generated a large volume of publications. However, there are still knowledge gaps yet to be filled and areas for improvement for the global research community. Our analysis of early COVID-19 research may be valuable in informing research prioritisation and policy planning both in the current COVID-19 pandemic and similar global health crises.","Liu, Chee, Niu, Pek, Siddiqui, Ansah, Matchar, Lam, Abdullah, Chan, Malhotra, Graves, Koh, Yoon, Ho, Ting, Low, Ong","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01059-y","20200714","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Evidence gap map; Review; SARS-CoV-2; Bibliometrics; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Literature; Pandemics; Periodicals as Topic; Pneumonia, Viral; PubMed","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Does 'Fear of COVID-19' trigger future career anxiety? An empirical investigation considering depression from COVID-19 as a mediator","Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the mental health of the people all around the world is severely disrupted. The purpose of this study is to identify whether 'Fear of COVID-19' impacted on future workforces' career anxiety at the first place and whether depression from COVID-19 has any indirect effect on 'Fear of COVID-19' and future workforces' career anxiety. Based on three different scales related to 'Fear of COVID-19', depression and career anxiety, a structured questionnaire was developed and the survey data was collected for this study. The empirical result of the study reveals that, due to the outbreak of COVID-19 fear, the future workforce is getting anxious about their future career. Again, depression from COVID-19, caused by 'Fear of COVID-19', as a mediator, has a significant indirect impact on the relationship between 'Fear of COVID-19' and future career anxiety, resulting in a full mediation. This means, due to the outbreak of 'Fear of COVID-19' people are becoming depressed and anxious about their future career which is creating a long-term negative effect on human psychology. These research findings will be a major tool for the policymakers, as well as the human resource planning professionals, to sketch plans after COVID-19 pandemic. This study is a novel work combining the concepts of fear and depression with career anxiety in a pandemic situation like COVID-19, and also assists future researchers in many folds.","Mahmud, Talukder, Rahman","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020935488","20200708","Fear of COVID-19; career anxiety; depression from COVID-19; structural equation modeling","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Screening for SARS-CoV-2 Infection Within a Psychiatric Hospital and Considerations for Limiting Transmission Within Residential Psychiatric Facilities - Wyoming, 2020","In the United States, approximately 180,000 patients receive mental health services each day at approximately 4,000 inpatient and residential psychiatric facilities (1). SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), can spread rapidly within congregate residential settings (2-4), including psychiatric facilities. On April 13, 2020, two patients were transferred to Wyoming's state psychiatric hospital from a private psychiatric hospital that had confirmed COVID-19 cases among its residents and staff members (5). Although both patients were asymptomatic at the time of transfer and one had a negative test result for SARS-CoV-2 at the originating facility, they were both isolated and received testing upon arrival at the state facility. On April 16, 2020, the test results indicated that both patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection. In response, the state hospital implemented expanded COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures (e.g., enhanced screening, testing, and management of new patient admissions) and adapted some standard IPC measures to facilitate implementation within the psychiatric patient population (e.g., use of modified face coverings). To assess the likely effectiveness of these procedures and determine SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence among patients and health care personnel (HCP) (6) at the state hospital, a point prevalence survey was conducted. On May 1, 2020, 18 days after the patients' arrival, 46 (61%) of 76 patients and 171 (61%) of 282 HCP had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All patients and HCP who received testing had negative test results, suggesting that the hospital's expanded IPC strategies might have been effective in preventing the introduction and spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection within the facility. In congregate residential settings, prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and application of strong IPC procedures are critical to ensuring the protection of other patients and staff members. Although standard guidance exists for other congregate facilities (7) and for HCP in general (8), modifications and nonstandard solutions might be needed to account for the specific needs of psychiatric facilities, their patients, and staff members.","Callaghan, Chard, Arnold, Loveland, Hull, Saraiya, Saydah, Dumont, Frakes, Johnson, Peltier, Van Houten, Trujillo, Moore, Rose, Honein, Carrington, Harrist, Hills","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6926a4","20200706","Adult; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Female; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Residential Facilities; Wyoming","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Dealing with Community Mental Health post the Fukushima disaster: lessons learnt for the COVID-19 pandemic","Under the COVID-19 pandemic, mitigation of psychological distress is required. At present, the demand for remote intervention for the numerous affected people is increasing, and telephonic support can be useful. Since the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, we have been developing a large-scale telephonic support system and implementing brief interventions for the Fukushima people identified at risk of psychological problems such as depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. In this paper, we report the lessons from the Fukushima disaster that can be applied to the COVID-19 pandemic and describe how the telephonic intervention facilitates easier access to psychological help for people with a broad range of psychological distress who are not able to visit treatment or care resources. In our telephonic intervention, we first sent a mental health and lifestyle survey to the people affected by the Fukushima disaster. The counselor team then provided telephonic intervention to high-risk persons as identified on the basis of the survey results. The individuals had expected to receive from the telephonic system help mainly in the form of stress-coping methods, social resource information such as schools, public offices or medical facilities, and lifestyle advice. Since we also experienced that psychological care for telephone counselors was necessary to mitigate the substantial emotional burden, we used the following three approaches: 1) regular supervision of the telephone counseling methods, 2) seminars for improvement of counseling skills and 3) individual psychological support. The positive loops between counselors and consulters will help advance a society affected by a disaster.","Momoi, Murakami, Horikoshi, Maeda","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa213","20200709",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact of quarantine due to COVID infection on migraine: a survey in Genova, Italy","Quarantine is a well-known risk factor for psychological and psychiatric disturbances. We evaluated burden of migraine during lockdown due to COVID 19 pandemia. Forty-nine subjects followed in our headache clinic for migraine were evaluated for migraine burden by means of global assessment of migraine severity (GAMS) and visual analogue scale (VAS) by phone interview. Moreover, depression and anxiety were quantified by Beck depression inventory (BDI) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). We evaluated changes in the value of migraine score from the 2 months immediately before lockdown (from January 1 to March 9) to the 2 months of quarantine (from March 10 to May 3). Value of GAMS was 5.61 Â± 0.76 before and 4.16 Â± 1.46 during quarantine (p &lt; .001). VAS was 7.49 Â± 1.10 before and 5.47 Â± 1.88 during quarantine (p &lt; .001). We also found a time by depression level interaction, F(1,47) = 6.21, p = .016, F(1,47) = 14.52, p &lt; .006, respectively, showing that subjects with lower level of depression had better course of migraine. In conclusion, we showed that, during quarantine due to COVID pandemia, subjects with migraine had fewer migraine attacks and lesser pain and show moderate level of depression, correlated to migraine burden.","Parodi, Poeta, Assini, Schirinzi, Del Sette","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04543-x","20200723","Anxiety; Covid; Depression; Migraine; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The impact of physical activity on psychological health during Covid-19 pandemic in Italy","The worldwide spread of COVID-19 has upset the normality of Italian daily life, forcing population to social distancing and self-isolation. Since the containment precautions also concern sport-related activities, home workout remained the only possibility to play sports and stay active during the pandemic. The present study aimed to examine changes in the physical activity levels during self-quarantine in Italy, and the impact of exercise on psychological health. A total of 2974 Italian subjects has completed an online survey, but only 2524 subjects resulted eligible for this study. The questionnaire measured the total weekly physical activity energy expenditure before and during quarantine (i.e. the sum of walking, moderate-intensity physical activities, and vigorous-intensity physical activities) in Metabolic Equivalent Task minutes per week (MET-min/wk) using an adapted version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire and their psychological well-being using the Psychological General Well Being Index. Of the 2524 Italian subjects included in the study, 1426 were females (56.4%) and 1098 males (43.6%). Total physical activity significantly decreased between before and during COVID-19 pandemic (Mean: 2429 vs. 1577 MET-min/wk, âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—p &lt; 0.0001), in all age groups and especially in men (Female, mean: 1994 vs. 1443 MET-min/wk, âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—p &lt; 0.0001; Male, mean: 2998 vs. 1754 MET-min/wk, âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—p &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, a significant positive correlation was found between the variation of physical activity and mental well-being (r = 0.07541, âˆ—âˆ—âˆ—p = 0.0002), suggesting that the reduction of total physical activity had a profoundly negative impact on psychological health and well-being of population.

"Key Strategies for Clinical Management and Improvement of Healthcare Services for Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetes Patients in the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Settings: Recommendations From the REPROGRAM Consortium","Patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes are at potentially higher risk of infection and fatality due to COVID-19. Given the social and economic costs associated with disability due to these conditions, it is imperative that specific considerations for clinical management of these patients be observed. Moreover, the reorganization of health services around the pandemic response further exacerbates the growing crisis around limited access, treatment compliance, acute medical needs, and mental health of patients in this specific subgroup. Existing recommendations and guidelines emanating from respective bodies have addressed some of the pressure points; however, there are variations and limitations <i>vis a vis</i> patient with multiple comorbidities such as obesity. This article will pull together a comprehensive assessment of the association of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity and COVID-19, its impact on the health systems and how best health systems can respond to mitigate current challenges and future needs. We anticipate that in the context of this pandemic, the cardiovascular disease and diabetes patients need a targeted strategy to ensure the harm to this group does not translate to huge costs to society and to the economy. Finally, we propose a triage and management protocol for patients with cardiovascular disease and diabetes in the COVID-19 settings to minimize harm to patients, health systems and healthcare workers alike.","Bhaskar, Rastogi, Chattu, Adisesh, Thomas, Alvarado, Riahi, Varun, Pai, Barsam, Walker","https://doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2020.00112","20200703","cardiovascular diseases (CVDs); clinical algorithm; coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); diabetes; healthcare services; obesity; personal protective equipment (PPE)","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health of young people and adults: a systematic review protocol of observational studies","Since the WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, the spread of the new coronavirus has been the focus of attention of scientists, governments and populations. One of the main concerns is the impact of this pandemic on health outcomes, mainly on mental health. Even though there are a few empirical studies on COVID-19 and mental health, so far, there is no systematic review about the impact of COVID-19 on mental health of young people and adults yet. We aim to critically synthesise the scientific evidence about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young people and adults. A systematic review will be performed through eight databases: MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), ISI-of-Knowledge, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica Database), SCOPUS, LILACS (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature), PsycINFO (Psychology Information) and CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), from inception until 30 June 2020. No restriction regarding the publication date, setting or languages will be considered. Preliminary search strategies were carried out on 29 March 2020 and will be updated in June 2020. The primary outcomes will be the prevalence and the severity of psychological symptoms in young people and adults (&gt;18â€‰years old) resulting from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Pooled standardised mean differences and 95% CIs will be calculated. The risk of bias of the observational studies will be assessed through the Methodological Index for Non-Randomised Studies (MINORS). Additionally, if sufficient data are available, a meta-analysis will be conducted. Heterogeneity between the studies will be determined by the I<sup>2</sup> statistics. Subgroup analyses will also be performed. Publication bias will be checked with funnel plots and Egger's test. Heterogeneity will be explored by random-effects analysis.

"Alcohol Consumption Reported during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Initial Stage","Physical health is not the only area affected by the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 virus pandemic. There are also other consequences that have globally affected many millions at other levels, namely: Societal, political, economic, and cultural. This study aims to survey alcohol drinking throughout the pandemic so as to investigate those factors considered most relevant; i.e., sociodemographic and clinical. A longitudinal study was designed. The first (or initial) stage was completed between April 10-20 2020 on 443 subjects during the enforcement of the &quot;Lockdown&quot; in Poland. The second stage will be due in June 2020. As well as an in-house questionnaire, the study used: The Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT), General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and the Brief COPE Inventory (Mini COPE). Alcohol was the most commonly used psychoactive substance (73%) identified. More than 30% changed their drinking habits because of the pandemic, with 16% actually drinking less, whilst 14% did so more. The former group was significantly younger than the latter. Amongst the stress-related coping strategies, it was found that current alcohol drinkers were significantly less able to find anything positive about the pandemic situation (positive reframing) and were mentally less able to cope. Those drinking more now were found to have been drinking more intensively before the pandemic started.","Chodkiewicz, Talarowska, Miniszewska, Nawrocka, Bilinski","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17134677","20200708","COVID-19; alcohol; mental health; stress; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Poland; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 Infection and Neurological Complications: Present Findings and Future Predictions","The present outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2, an influenza virus with neurotropic potential, presents with neurological manifestations in a large proportion of the affected individuals. Disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system are all present, while stroke, ataxia, seizures, and depressed level of consciousness are more common in severely affected patients. People with these severe complications are most likely elderly with medical comorbidities, especially hypertension and other vascular risk factors. However, postinfectious complications are also expected. Neurological disorders as sequelae of influenza viruses have been repeatedly documented in the past and include symptoms, signs, and diseases occurring during the acute phase and, not rarely, during follow-up. Postinfectious neurological complications are the result of the activation of immune mechanisms and can explain the insurgence of immune-mediated diseases, including the Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and other diseases of the central and peripheral nervous system that in the past occurred as complications of viral infections and occasionally with vaccines. For these reasons, the present outbreak calls for the introduction of surveillance systems to monitor changes in the frequency of several immune-mediated neurological diseases. These changes will determine a reorganization of the measures apt to describe the interaction between the virus, the environment, and the host in areas of different dimensions, from local communities to regions with several millions of inhabitants. The public health system, mainly primary care, needs to be strengthened to ensure that research and development efforts are directed toward right needs and directions. To cope with the present pandemic, better collaboration is required between international organizations along with more research funding, and tools in order to detect, treat, and prevent future epidemics.","Beghi, Feigin, Caso, Santalucia, Logroscino","https://doi.org/10.1159/000508991","20200701","Coronavirus; Infection; Neurological disorders; Outbreak","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Pre-outbreak determinants of perceived risks of corona infection and preventive measures taken A prospective population-based study","Assess how people perceive the risks of coronavirus infection, whether people take preventive measures, and which pre-outbreak factors contribute to the perceived risks and measures taken, such as pre-outbreak respiratory problems, heart problems, diabetes, anxiety and depression symptoms, loneliness, age, gender, marital and employment status and education level. Data were collected in the longitudinal LISS panel, based on a random sample of the Dutch population. The coronavirus survey started on March 2, and the data collection ended on March 17 2020. Data were linked with surveys on health and social integration conducted at the end of 2019 (Nstudy sample = 3,540). About 15% perceived the risk of infection as high, and 11% the risk becoming ill when infected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed the following. Older age-groups perceived the risk for coronavirus infection as lower (all adjusted Odd Ratio's [aOR] â‰¤ .070). In total, 43.8% had taken preventive measures, especially females (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.26-1.70). Those with lower education levels less often used preventive measures (aOR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.45-0.67). Those with pre-outbreak respiratory problems (aOR = 2.75, 95% CI = 2.11-3.57), heart problems (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.34-2.92) and diabetes (aOR = 3.12, 95% CI = 2.02-4.82) perceived the risk becoming ill when infected as higher than others. However, respondents with pre-outbreak respiratory problems and diabetes did not more often take preventive measures. Vulnerable patients more often recognize that they are at risk becoming ill when infected by the coronavirus, but many do not take preventive measures. Interventions to stimulate the use of preventive measures should pay additional attention to physically vulnerable patients, males and those with lower education levels.","van der Velden, Marchand, Cuelenaere, Das","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234600","20200715",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prevalence of and Risk Factors Associated With Mental Health Symptoms Among the General Population in China During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","People exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and a series of imperative containment measures could be psychologically stressed, yet the burden of and factors associated with mental health symptoms remain unclear. To investigate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with mental health symptoms in the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. This large-sample, cross-sectional, population-based, online survey study was conducted from February 28, 2020, to March 11, 2020. It involved all 34 province-level regions in China and included participants aged 18 years and older. Data analysis was performed from March to May 2020. The prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and acute stress among the general population in China during the COVID-19 pandemic was evaluated using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Insomnia Severity Index, and Acute Stress Disorder Scale. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore demographic and COVID-19-related risk factors. Of 71â€¯227 individuals who clicked on the survey link, 56â€¯932 submitted the questionnaires, for a participation rate of 79.9%. After excluding the invalid questionnaires, 56â€¯679 participants (mean [SD] age, 35.97â€‰[8.22] years; 27â€¯149 men [47.9%]) were included in the study; 39â€¯468 respondents (69.6%) were aged 18 to 39 years. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rates of mental health symptoms among the survey respondents were 27.9% (95% CI, 27.5%-28.2%) for depression, 31.6% (95% CI, 31.2%-32.0%) for anxiety, 29.2% (95% CI, 28.8%-29.6%) for insomnia, and 24.4% (95% CI, 24.0%-24.7%) for acute stress. Participants with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and their family members or friends had a high risk for symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratios [ORs], 3.27 [95% CI, 1.84-5.80] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.26-1.85] for family or friends), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 2.48 [95% CI, 1.43-4.31] for patients; 1.53 [95% CI, 1.27-1.84] for family or friends), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 3.06 [95% CI, 1.73-5.43] for patients; 1.62 [95% CI, 1.35-1.96] for family or friends), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 3.50 [95% CI, 2.02-6.07] for patients; 1.77 [95% CI, 1.46-2.15] for family or friends). Moreover, people with occupational exposure risks and residents in Hubei province had increased odds of symptoms of depression (adjusted ORs, 1.96 [95% CI, 1.77-2.17] for occupational exposure; 1.42 [95% CI, 1.19-1.68] for Hubei residence), anxiety (adjusted ORs, 1.93 [95% CI, 1.75-2.13] for occupational exposure; 1.54 [95% CI, 1.30-1.82] for Hubei residence), insomnia (adjusted ORs, 1.60 [95% CI, 1.45-1.77] for occupational exposure; 1.20 [95% CI, 1.01-1.42] for Hubei residence), and acute stress (adjusted ORs, 1.98 [95% CI, 1.79-2.20] for occupational exposure; 1.49 [95% CI, 1.25-1.79] for Hubei residence). Both centralized quarantine (adjusted ORs, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.10-1.61] for depression; 1.46 [95% CI, 1.22-1.75] for anxiety; 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.95] for insomnia; 1.46 [95% CI, 1.21-1.77] for acute stress) and home quarantine (adjusted ORs, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.25-1.36] for depression; 1.28 [95% CI, 1.23-1.34] for anxiety; 1.24 [95% CI, 1.19-1.30] for insomnia; 1.29 [95% CI, 1.24-1.35] for acute stress) were associated with the 4 negative mental health outcomes. Being at work was associated with lower risks of depression (adjusted OR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.79-0.91]), anxiety (adjusted OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.86-0.99]), and insomnia (adjusted OR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.81-0.94]). The results of this survey indicate that mental health symptoms may have been common during the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in China, especially among infected individuals, people with suspected infection, and people who might have contact with patients with COVID-19. Some measures, such as quarantine and delays in returning to work, were also associated with mental health among the public. These findings identify populations at risk for mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and may help in implementing mental health intervention policies in other countries and regions.","Shi, Lu, Que, Huang, Liu, Ran, Gong, Yuan, Yan, Sun, Shi, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.14053","20200713","Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Mental Status Schedule; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Quarantine; Return to Work; Risk Factors; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Interactive mental health assessments for Chinese Canadians: A pilot randomized controlled trial in nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic","Mental health conditions like depression and anxiety are on the rise, but access to care remains a challenge. Immigrants and racialized communities including Chinese Canadians experience high level of access barriers including communication with clinicians. With the aim to facilitate mental health communications, we tested an Interactive Computer-assisted Client Assessment Survey (iCCAS) in Cantonese/Mandarin and English at a nurse practitioner-led primary care clinic in Toronto. The iCCAS offers a touch-screen, pre-consultation survey with questions on depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, alcohol abuse, and social context. The program generates point-of-care reports for the clinician and patient. A pilot randomized controlled trial examined the intervention impact on mental health discussion and symptom detection, compared with the usual care, followed by clinicians' qualitative interviews. Fifty self-identified Chinese adult patients participated (iCCAS = 26, Usual Care = 24), response rate 79.4%. Participant mean age was 44.8â€‰years and 92% were immigrants. There was an increase of 19% and 15% in the mental health discussion and detection of symptoms in the iCCAS group compared with the usual care. More participants in the iCCAS group were referred to a social worker or psychiatrist. Patients found the use of iCCAS easy and clinicians identified its benefits for themselves (eg, early identification and comfort) and patients (eg, self-awareness and anonymity) and proposed practice-integration. The studied tool holds promise for enhancing clinician-patient mental health communications in primary care settings for overseas Chinese. Implications are discussed for in-person and virtual healthcare which could also inform responses to mental health crisis related to COVID-19.","Ahmad, Wang, Wong, Fung","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12400","20200701","computer; depression; immigrant Chinese; interactive; primary care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The respondents (N = 801, 53.8% females; 56.2% with children) came from the five macro-regions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18% South, 10% Central-West). Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our findings and new research directions are discussed. Our study was conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey should be reapplied during and after the pandemic, so that we can deepen our knowledge of the socio-demographic characteristics and subjective well-being indicators associated with pet ownership.","Defelipe, Savalli, Otta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04069","20200710","Demographics; Pet ownership; Pets; Psychology; Well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Determining depression and related factors in a society affected by COVID-19 pandemic","Turkey has one of the highest death rates in the world due to COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic caused anxiety and depression in individuals. However, there is insufficient information on the effects of COVID-19 on individuals and their coping methods. Therefore, mental problems associated with the pandemic need to be evaluated rapidly. This study was carried out to determine depression levels and related factors in a society affected by COVID-19. The study was planned using a descriptive cross-sectional design. The study started 2â€‰weeks after the first diagnosis of COVID-19 in Turkey and was carried out between March 23 and April 3, 2020. The study included 1115 adult participants who were between 18 and 65â€‰years of age and were citizens of the Turkish Republic. The study was carried out using online questionnaires, and data were collected with the Personal Information Form and the Beck Depression Inventory. The data were evaluated using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 20 software program. The depression scores of female participants who were between 18 and 29â€‰years of age, single, students, and had less income than their expenses were found to be higher than others. People who experienced fear of being infected and infecting others, had a cleaning obsession, anxiety about the future, sadness, and anxiousness experienced depression at lower levels when compared to other participants. Participants who had to change their place of residence during the quarantine, experienced loneliness, fear of death, hopelessness, sleep problems, felt useless and worthless, started to smoke and drink alcohol, and experienced depression at moderate levels. Depression scores of those who spent time with their family, made time for themselves, were busy with home education or work were lower compared to others. The COVID-19 pandemic caused mild-level depression in the Turkish society.","Ustun","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020938807","20200703","COVID-19; coronavirus; depression; pandemic; quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psycho-Emotional Approach to the Psychological Distress Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study","Anxiety, depression, and stress are common and expected reactions to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The objective of this study is to analyze psychological distress in a sample of Spanish population, identifying the predictive nature of the information received, the preventive measures taken, level of concern, beliefs, and knowledge about the infection. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on a sample of 4615 participants. Data were collected through a self-prepared questionnaire and the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). Bivariate analyses and logistic regressions were performed. Of the total participants, 71.98% presented psychological distress. The study population actively sought information about coronavirus, expressed a high level of concern and knowledge, and the most frequent preventive behavior was hand washing. As predictive factors, the degree of concern for COVID-19 was identified (odds ratio (OR) = 1.244, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [1.179, 1.312]), the number of hours spent consulting information on COVID-19 (OR = 1.038, 95% CI = [1.009, 1.068]), or the need for psychological support (OR = 1.135, 95% CI = [1.094, 1.177]), among others.

"Keeping Patients With Cancer Exercising in the Age of COVID-19","The novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is a global public health emergency. To date, physical distancing and good personal hygiene have been the only effective measures to limit spread. The pandemic has altered routine cancer care, including allied health and supportive care interventions. Clinicians must adapt and find ways to continue to deliver optimal patient care at this time. The prescription of exercise to people with cancer has been demonstrated to have meaningful benefits for both physical and mental health and quality of life, and may even enhance survival. Such exercise interventions provide the largest benefit to patients when delivered in a supervised, group, clinic-based setting. In the age of COVID-19, group-based exercise in communal facilities presents risks for both aerosol and surface transmission of the virus among people exercising, necessitating a pivot from the usual methods of exercise delivery to home-based exercise programs. In this article, we discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in moving to a home-based program for patients with cancer while maintaining the benefits of targeted and high-fidelity exercise medicine. We provide practical recommendations for how home-based exercise can be supported and nurtured by qualified exercise professionals who treat people living with cancer, as well as pointing to resources that are available online to assist practitioners. Despite the challenges faced during this pandemic, we believe that it is important for people to continue to benefit from exercise in a safe environment with the support of exercise specialists.","Newton, Hart, Clay","https://doi.org/10.1200/OP.20.00210","20200630",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

On the 1<sup>st</sup> of April 2020, 5,158 Australians completed a survey from the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project, a nationwide study aimed at tracking key mental health concerns. Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviours) and proximal factors (employment, lifestyle factors and mood) were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Distal factors including heavier drinking pre-pandemic, middle age, average or higher income; and proximal factors including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self-reported history of mental illness became non-significant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety or status as an essential or health care worker were not associated with increased drinking. These results provide guidance as to who might be targeted to receive support based on predisposing demographic factors and pre-pandemic drinking behaviour. Second, they indicate what behaviours/factors accompany increased alcohol use and provide targets for psychosocial and psychoeducational supports to address these proximal factors.

"How the COVID-19 pandemic is focusing attention on loneliness and social isolation","The effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upon human health, economic activity and social engagement have been swift and far reaching. Emerging evidence shows that the pandemic has had dramatic mental health impacts, bringing about increased anxiety and greater social isolation due to the physical distancing policies introduced to control the disease. In this context, it is possible to more deeply appreciate the health consequences of loneliness and social isolation, which researchers have argued are enduring experiences for many people and under-recognised contributors to public health. In this paper, we examine the social and psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on what this has revealed about the need to better understand and respond to social isolation and loneliness as public health priorities. Social isolation and loneliness are understood to be distinct conditions, yet each has been found to predict premature mortality, depression, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Estimates of the prevalence and distribution of social isolation and loneliness vary, possibly ranging from one-in-six to one-in-four people, and the lack of knowledge about the extent of these conditions indicates the need for population monitoring using standardised methods and validated measures. Reviews of the evidence relating to social isolation and loneliness interventions have found that befriending schemes, individual and group therapies, various shared activity programs, social prescription by healthcare providers, and diverse strategies using information and communication technologies have been tried. There remains uncertainty about what is effective for different population groups, particularly for prevention and for addressing the more complex condition of loneliness. In Australia, a national coalition - Ending Loneliness Together - has been established to bring together researchers and service providers to facilitate evidence gathering and the mobilisation of knowledge into practice. Research-practice partnerships and cross-disciplinary collaborations of this sort are essential for overcoming the public health problems of loneliness and social isolation that have pre-existed and will endure beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Smith, Lim","https://doi.org/10.17061/phrp3022008","20200706","Australia; Community Networks; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Loneliness; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Self Efficacy; Social Isolation; Social Support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Infertility remains a top stressor despite the COVID-19 pandemic","What is the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertility patients? An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice in the USA between 1 January 2019 and 1 April 2020. At three different time-points respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of 10 commonly reported life stressors. The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients, with 3604 responses (response rate 34%) received. A total of 2202 non-pregnant female respondents were included in the final analysis. One-third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one-quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking antidepressant medications. At all three time-points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor among the respondents in early March but, at the time of writing, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66%, respectively). A total of 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19, causing economic and societal uncertainty, the stress of infertility remains significant and is comparable a stressor to the pandemic itself.","Vaughan, Shah, Penzias, Domar, Toth","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.05.015","20200702",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Examining the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown in Wuhan and Lombardy: A Psycholinguistic Analysis on Weibo and Twitter","Many countries are taking strict quarantine policies to prevent the rapid spread of COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) around the world, such as city lockdown. Cities in China and Italy were locked down in the early stage of the pandemic. The present study aims to examine and compare the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on individuals' psychological states in China and Italy. We achieved the aim by (1) sampling Weibo users (geo-location = Wuhan, China) and Twitter users (geo-location = Lombardy, Italy); (2) fetching all the users' published posts two weeks before and after the lockdown in each region (e.g., the lockdown date of Wuhan was 23 January 2020); (3) extracting the psycholinguistic features of these posts using the Simplified Chinese and Italian version of Language Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) dictionary; and (4) conducting Wilcoxon tests to examine the changes in the psycholinguistic characteristics of the posts before and after the lockdown in Wuhan and Lombardy, respectively. Results showed that individuals focused more on &quot;home&quot;, and expressed a higher level of cognitive process after a lockdown in both Wuhan and Lombardy. Meanwhile, the level of stress decreased, and the attention to leisure increased in Lombardy after the lockdown. The attention to group, religion, and emotions became more prevalent in Wuhan after the lockdown. Findings provide decision-makers timely evidence on public reactions and the impacts on psychological states in the COVID-19 context, and have implications for evidence-based mental health interventions in two countries.","Su, Xue, Liu, Wu, Chen, Chen, Liu, Gong, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124552","20200708","impact of COVID-19 lockdown; psycholinguistic analysis; psychological states; public health emergencies; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Humans; Italy; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psycholinguistics; Quarantine; Social Media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The Impact of COVID-19 on HIV Treatment and Research: A Call to Action","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is far reaching, with devastating effects on individuals, communities, and societies across the world. People with chronic health conditions may be at greater risk of contracting or experiencing complications from COVID-19. In addition to illness or death for those who contract the virus, the physical distancing required to flatten the curve of new cases is having a negative impact on the economy, the effects of which intersect with mental health and other existing health concerns, thus affecting marginalized communities. Given that HIV also has a disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, COVID-19 is affecting people with HIV (PWH) in unique ways and will continue to have an impact on HIV research and treatment after the COVID-19 crisis passes. Using the biopsychosocial framework to contextualize the impact of COVID-19 on PWH, the purpose of this review article is to: (1) outline the similarities and differences between the COVID-19 and HIV pandemics; (2) describe the current and future impact of COVID-19 on PWH; and (3) outline a call to action for scientists and practitioners to respond to the impact of COVID-19 on HIV prevention and treatment.","Chenneville, Gabbidon, Hanson, Holyfield","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124548","20200708","AIDS; COVID-19; HIV; coronavirus; health disparities; Anti-HIV Agents; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; HIV Infections; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The United Nations and its agencies (the World Health Organization and UNICEF), Indian Association For Child and Adolescent Mental Health and National Institute of Mental Health and Neuroscience in India warn about the broader impacts on children and call for urgent action to support the world's children amidst the pandemic which may have lasting consequences. The COVID-19 pandemic and unprecedented control measures to prevent its spread have disrupted nearly every aspect of children's lives - their health, development, learning, behaviour and their families' economic security, including protection from violence and abuse.

"Up and about: Older adults' wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Swedish longitudinal study","To investigate early effects of the COVID-19 pandemic related to 1) levels of worry, risk perception, and social distancing; 2) longitudinal effects on wellbeing; and 3) effects of worry, risk perception, and social distancing on wellbeing. We analyzed annual changes in four aspects of wellbeing over five years (2015-2020): life satisfaction, financial satisfaction, self-rated health, and loneliness in a subsample (n=1071, aged 60-71) from a larger survey of Swedish older adults. The 2020 wave, collected March 26-April 2, included measures of worry, risk perception, and social distancing in response to COVID-19. 1) In relation to COVID-19: 44.9% worried about health, 69.5% about societal consequences, 25.1% about financial consequences; 86.4% perceived a high societal risk, 42.3% a high risk of infection, and 71.2% reported high levels of social distancing. 2) Wellbeing remained stable (life satisfaction and loneliness) or even increased (self-rated health and financial satisfaction) in 2020 compared to previous years. 3) More worry about health and financial consequences was related to lower scores in all four wellbeing measures. Higher societal worry and more social distancing were related to higher wellbeing. In the early stage of the pandemic, Swedish older adults on average rated their wellbeing as high as, or even higher than, previous years. However, those who worried more reported lower wellbeing. Our findings speak to the resilience, but also heterogeneity, among older adults during the pandemic. Further research, on a broad range of health factors and long-term psychological consequences, is needed.","Kivi, Hansson, BjÃ¤lkebring","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa084","20200709","Longitudinal Change; Mental Health; Risk Perception","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Quality of Life for Women with Ovarian Cancer","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented challenges for the oncology community. For people living with cancer, treatments are interrupted, surgeries cancelled and regular oncology evaluations rescheduled. People with cancer and their physicians must balance plausible fears of COVID-19 and cancer treatment with the consequences of delaying cancer care. We aim to evaluate the experience of women with ovarian cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women with a current or prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer completed an online survey focusing on treatment interruptions and quality of life (QOL). QOL was measured with the Cancer Worry Scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The survey was distributed through survivor networks and social media. Univariate and multivariable linear regression analysis were utilized to evaluate the effect of participant characteristics on QOL survey scores. Six hundred and three women, from 41 states, visited the survey website between March 30 and April 13, 2020 and 555 (92.0%) completed the survey. The median age was 58 years (range 20-85). Two hundred and seventeen participants (43.3%) were in active treatment at the time of survey completion. One hundred and seventy-five participants (33%) experienced a delay in some component of their cancer care. Ten (26.3%) of the 38 participants scheduled for surgery experienced a delay and 18 (8.3%) of the 217 participants scheuled for nonsurgical cancer treatment. One hundred and thirty-three participants (24.0%) had a delayed physician appointment, 84 (15.1%) laboratory test and 53 (9.6%) cancer related imaging. Among the cohort, 88.6% (489) reported significant cancer worry, 51.4% (285) borderline or abnormal anxiety and 26.5% (147) borderline or abnormal depression. On univariate analysis, age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer treatment or cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, self-described as immunocompromised and use of telemedicine were all associated with higher levels of cancer worry. Higher anxiety scores were associated with age less than 65 years and self-described as immunocompromised. Higher depression scores were associated with age less than 65 years, being scheduled for cancer surgery, delay in oncology care, self-described as immunocompromised and use of telemedicine. On multivariable linear regression analysis, age less than 65 and being self-described as immunocompromised were independently predictive of greater cancer worry, anxiety and depression and delay in cancer care was predictive of anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 crisis is impacting care of ovarian cancer patients: surgeries, treatments, scheduled physician appointments, laboratory tests and imaging are cancelled or delayed. Younger age, presumed immunocompromise and delay in cancer care were associated with significantly higher levels of cancer worry, anxiety and depression. Providers must work with patients to balance competing risks of COVID-19 and cancer, recognizing that communication is a critical clinical tool to improve quality of life in these times.","Frey, Ellis, Zeligs, Chapman-Davis, Thomas, Christos, Kolev, Prasad-Hayes, Cohen, Holcomb, Blank","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.049","20200702","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cancer worry; Coronavirus; Depression; Ovarian cancer","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Assessment of the psychological status of urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic]","The aim of this study was to analyze the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress in urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. 90 urologists aged 25 to 60 years (M=37.27, S.D.=9.53), 93% of them were men, participated in the online survey. They answered questions about their attitude to their job as doctors and the impact of COVID-19. They filled out the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21), the Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) and answered questions assessing their sense of control. The greatest concern among urologists is the risk of getting infected with COVID-19 (for 30% of the doctors). 43% of urologists state that their profession interesting. A positive attitude to work, as well as the Big Five traits (Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability and Agreeableness) are associated with lower levels of depression, anxiety, stress and lack of control. Working with COVID-19 patients reduces stress and increases the sense of control. Age and high levels of Emotional Stability predicted lower levels of anxiety, depression and stress. Working with COVID-19 patients allows doctors to feel more control over what is happening. A sense of control, in turn, and a positive attitude towards work are associated with a lower levels of depression, anxiety and stresssymptoms. The results of this study can be used in selection of therapeutic targets for psychotherapy, administered to doctors; in prevention of symptoms of anxiety, stress and depression among doctors; and in professional selection of doctors for working in crisis situations.","Krasavtseva, Kiseleva, Kasyan, Pushkar","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Assessment+of+the+psychological+status+of+urologists+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic].","20200701","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; sense of control; stress; Adult; Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urologists","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Duties toward Patients with Psychiatric Illness","Patients with psychiatric illness feel the brunt of the intersection of many of our society's and our health care system's disparities, and the vulnerability of this population during the Covid-19 pandemic cannot be overstated. Patients with psychiatric illness often suffer from the stigma of mental illness and receive poor medical care. Many patients with severe and persistent mental illness face additional barriers, including poverty, marginal housing, and food insecurity. Patients who require psychiatric hospitalization now face the risk of transmission of Covid-19 due to the inherent difficulties of social distancing within a psychiatric hospital. Patients whose freedom and self-determination have been temporarily overruled as they receive involuntary psychiatric treatment deserve a setting that maintains their health and safety. While tele-mental health has been rapidly expanded to provide new ways to access psychiatric treatment, some patients may have limitations in technological literacy or access to devices. The social isolation, economic fallout, and potential traumatization related to the current pandemic will disproportionately affect this vulnerable population, and society's duties to them must be considered.","Conrad, Baum, Shah, Levy-Carrick, Biswas, Schmelzer, Silbersweig","https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1139","20200716","disparities; involuntary hospitalization; mental illness; psychiatry; trauma; Betacoronavirus; Bioethical Issues; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Health Services Accessibility; Hospitalization; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Trauma; Residence Characteristics; Severity of Illness Index; Social Isolation; Social Stigma; Socioeconomic Factors; Telemedicine; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Walls","In a field that strives to care for patients and families together, what can palliative care clinicians do when patients' families are physically absent? The Covid-19 pandemic has put both literal and figurative walls between health care professionals and families. How health care workers respond to these disconnections might have a lasting impact on patients, on families, and on our practice. Recently, I saw this in the case of a patient our palliative care team was consulted to see. Mr. B was minimally responsive and dying from multisystem organ failure of unclear etiology. As in other cases during this pandemic, our team became a facilitator of interaction between the patient and the physically absent family, seeing an intimacy we normally would not, in this case, by being present while our intern held the phone to Mr. B's ear for an end-of-life call from his wife, son, and daughter. Such moments force us clinicians to be even more present for our families and patients, and they allow us to bear witness to the strength and sadness and love that we might otherwise miss.","Hauser","https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1121","20200716","Covid-19; clinical ethics; clinician-family relationship; end-of-life care; palliative care; patient-family relationship; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ethics Consultation; Family; Humans; Palliative Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Development of a psychological first-aid model in inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","Facing the social panic and substantial shortage of medical resources during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, providing psychological first-aid to inpatients is essential for their rehabilitation and the orderly operating of medical systems. However, the closed-ward environment and extreme shortage of onsite mental health workers have limited the use of traditional face-to-face diagnosis and psychological interventions. To develop a mental health intervention model for inpatients that can be applied during a widespread epidemic, such as COVID-19. In a medical team stationed in Leishenshan Hospital, Wuhan, China, we integrated onsite and online psychological support resources to implement a graded psychological intervention system. The onsite psychiatrist established trust with the patients and classified them into categories according to their symptom severity. While face-to-face evaluation and intervention are critical for effective online support, the online team effectively extended the scope of the 'first-aid' to all patients. This integrated onsite and online approach was effective and efficient in providing psychological interventions for inpatients during the crisis. Our model provides a realistic scheme for healthcare systems in or after the COVID-19 epidemic and also could be adopted in areas of the world with insufficient mental healthcare resources.","Cheng, Zhang, Hua, Yang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100292","20200630","depression; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Stress and sleep: a survey based on wearable sleep trackers among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the sleep health of local medical and nursing staff. We used wearable pulse oximeters to monitor and screen the medical and nursing staff working in hospitals designated for COVID-19 in the Wuhan area. This study aimed to establish a reliable basis to provide sleep intervention for the medical and nursing staff. Thirty medical and nursing staff members with symptoms of insomnia were instructed to wear medical ring-shaped pulse oximeters to monitor their sleep overnight. We also used the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Chinese version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to evaluate the severity of insomnia and mental health status, respectively, for each participant. Among the 30 participants, only 26 completed the screening. Ten cases (38.5%) demonstrated moderate to severe sleep apnoea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) when using an oxygen desaturation index â‰¥15 times/hour as the cut-off value. Participants with comorbid moderate to severe SAHS had significantly higher ISI and SRQ scores (p values 0.034 and 0.016, respectively) than those in the insomnia group. Correlation analysis revealed that ISI was positively correlated with total sleep time (TST) (r=0.435, p=0.026), and negatively correlated with deep sleep (r=-0.495, p=0.010); furthermore, patient SRQ scores were positively correlated with TST, sleep efficiency (SE) and REM (rapid eyes movement) sleep % (r=0.454 and 0.389, 0.512; p=0.020, 0.050 and 0.008, respectively). Stepwise logistic regression indicated that SRQ-20 and sex were risk factors for insomnia with comorbid SAHS, and their OR values were 1.516 and 11.56 (95% CI 1.053 to 2.180 and 1.037 to 128.9), respectively. Medical and nursing staff with insomnia showed clear signs of comorbid sleep apnoea attributable to stress.

"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers: a cross-sectional study in China","Healthcare workers fighting against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are under tremendous pressure, which puts them at an increased risk of developing psychological problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of psychological problems in different healthcare workers (ie, physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals) during the COVID-19 pandemic in China and explore factors that are associated with the onset of psychological problems in this population during this public health crisis. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted in February 2020 among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological problems were assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire and Insomnia Severity Index. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors that were associated with psychological problems. The prevalence of symptoms of anxiety, depression, insomnia and the overall psychological problems in healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in China was 46.04%, 44.37%, 28.75% and 56.59%, respectively. The prevalence of the overall psychological problems in physicians, medical residents, nurses, technicians and public health professionals was 60.35%, 50.82%, 62.02%, 57.54% and 62.40%, respectively. Compared with healthcare workers who did not participate in front-line work, front-line healthcare workers had a higher risk of anxiety, insomnia and overall psychological problems. In addition, attention to negative or neutral information about the pandemic, receiving negative feedback from families and friends who joined front-line work, and unwillingness to join front-line work if given a free choice were three major factors for these psychological problems. Psychological problems are pervasive among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Receiving negative information and participating in front-line work appear to be important risk factors for psychological problems. The psychological health of different healthcare workers should be protected during the COVID-19 pandemic with timely interventions and proper information feedback.","Que, Shi, Deng, Liu, Zhang, Wu, Gong, Huang, Yuan, Yan, Sun, Ran, Bao, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100259","20200630","anxiety; depression; prevalence; psychological phenomena; risk factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychosocial burden of healthcare professionals in times of COVID-19 - a survey conducted at the University Hospital Augsburg","<b>Objective:</b> The outbreak of COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020. Studies from China, where the virus first spread, have reported increased psychological strain in healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial burden of physicians and nurses depending on their degree of contact with COVID-19 patients. In addition, we explored which supportive resources they used and which supportive needs they experienced during the crisis. <b>Methods:</b> Data were collected between March and April 2020 at the University Hospital Augsburg. A total of 75 nurses and 35 physicians, working either in a special COVID-19 ward or in a regular ward, took part in the survey. The participants filled in two standardized questionnaires (the Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; and the Maslach Burnout Inventory, MBI), and reported their fear of a COVID-19 infection and stress at work on a 10-point Likert scale. Finally, they answered three open-ended questions about causes of burden, supportive resources and needs during the crisis. <b>Results:</b> Nurses working in the COVID-19 wards reported higher levels of stress, exhaustion, and depressive mood, as well as lower levels of work-related fulfilment compared to their colleagues in the regular wards. Physicians reported similar scores independent of their contact with COVID-19 patients. The most common causes for burden were job strain and uncertainty about the future. Psychosocial support as well as leisure time were listed as important resources, and a better infrastructure adjustment to COVID-19 at the hospital (e.g. sufficient staff, keeping teams and working schedules stable) as suggestion for improvement. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings indicate that especially nurses working in COVID-19 wards are affected psychologically by the consequences of the pandemic. This might be due to a higher workload and longer time in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, compared to physicians. <b>Ziel:</b> Im MÃ¤rz 2020 wurde der Ausbruch von COVID-19 von der WHO zur Pandemie erklÃ¤rt, nachdem sich der Virus zunÃ¤chst vor allem in China ausbreitete. Erste Studien berichteten von einer erhÃ¶hten psychologischen Belastung der BeschÃ¤ftigten im chinesischen Gesundheitssystem. Das Ziel der vorliegenden Studie war es, die besonderen psychosozialen Belastungen von Ã„rztinnen und Ã„rzten im Vergleich zu Pflegerinnen und Pflegern durch COVID-19 zu erfassen, unter BerÃ¼cksichtigung des AusmaÃŸes der Exposition zu COVID-19-Patientinnen und -Patienten. ZusÃ¤tzlich wollten wir besonders relevante Ressourcen und MÃ¶glichkeiten zur Entlastung eruieren.<b>Methoden:</b> Die Datenerhebung erfolgte zwischen MÃ¤rz und April 2020 am UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Augsburg. Insgesamt nahmen 75 Pflegerinnen und Pfleger sowie 35 Ã„rztinnen und Ã„rzte an der Untersuchung teil, die entweder in regulÃ¤ren oder speziellen COVID-19-Stationen tÃ¤tig waren. Neben zwei Standardinstrumenten (Gesundheitsfragebogen PHQ und Fragebogen zur Arbeitsbelastung MBI) bewerteten die Teilnehmenden ihre Angst, sich mit COVID-19 zu infizieren, und das AusmaÃŸ der Belastung am Arbeitsplatz auf 10-stufigen numerischen Ratingskalen. ZusÃ¤tzlich wurden drei offene Fragen zu den grÃ¶ÃŸten Belastungen, Ressourcen und BedÃ¼rfnissen durch bzw. in der Krise beantwortet.<b>Ergebnisse:</b> Insbesondere Pflegerinnen und Pfleger auf COVID-19-Stationen berichteten mehr Stress, ErmÃ¼dung, depressive Symptome und geringere ErfÃ¼llung am Arbeitsplatz als ihre Kolleginnen und Kollegen auf den regulÃ¤ren Stationen. Ã„rztinnen und Ã„rzte hingegen erzielten unabhÃ¤ngig von der spezifischen Exposition zu COVID-19-Patientinnen und -Patienten Ã¤hnliche Ergebnisse. Am hÃ¤ufigsten wurden von den Teilnehmenden das Arbeitspensum und die Ungewissheit hinsichtlich der weiteren Entwicklung als Ursache ihrer Belastung benannt. Psychosoziale UnterstÃ¼tzung und Freizeit wurden als wichtige Ressourcen aufgelistet. Die Teilnehmenden mahnten u.a. an, auf ausreichendes Personal, KontinuitÃ¤t der Teamzusammensetzung und Schichtplanung zu achten.<b>Schlussfolgerungen:</b> Unsere Ergebnisse zeigen, dass insbesondere das Pflegepersonal â€“ im Kontrast zu Ã„rztinnen und Ã„rzten â€“ auf COVID-19-Stationen psychosozial unter den Folgen der Pandemie leidet, vermutlich als Konsequenz der Mehrarbeit und des hÃ¶heren Expositionsrisikos.","Zerbini, Ebigbo, Reicherts, Kunz, Messman","https://doi.org/10.3205/000281","20200706","COVID-19; health personnel; health resources; mental health; psychological burnout; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Germany; Health Personnel; Hospitals, University; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Occupational Health; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Patient Care Team; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Workload; World Health Organization","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Coronavirus Disease 2019, School Closures, and Children's Mental Health","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late December of 2019 is rapidly spreading across the globe. The South Korean government has ordered the closure of all schools, as part of its attempts to use social distancing measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The effects of the school closures on reducing contagion are generally positive; however, the measure is controversial because of the socioeconomic ripple effect that accompanies it. The author briefly reviewed the existing literature on the mental health aspects of disasters and presents the issues related to school closures due to pandemics, from medical and socioeconomic perspectives and in terms of children's mental health. The results of this review suggest that research on children's mental health in relation to the adoption of school closures as a pandemic mitigation strategy is urgently needed.","Bahn","https://doi.org/10.5765/jkacap.200010","20200630","COVID-19; Children; Coronavirus disease 2019; Economy; Mental health; Pandemic; Resilience; School closures","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Differences in anxiety, sadness, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and sadness as a function of age and self-perceptions of aging during the lock-out period due to COVID-19]","To analyze differences by age group in anxiety, depression, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and depression in young people, middle aged adults and older adults during the lock-down period at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the association between negative self-perceptions of aging and psychological symptoms controlling by age group. Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging. Older adults reported lower psychological anxiety, sadness and loneliness than the other age groups.

"Psychological states of COVID-19 quarantine","The psychological effects of mass quarantine following the COVID-19 lockdown are likely to be significant. Emotional and behavioural responses to quarantine are related to a psychological state of anxiety. These and other emotions are normal and may even be adaptive. The exceptional circumstances of a national lockdown provide an opportunity to develop mental health literacy in the form of psychological first aid, to enable wider awareness of how individuals can contribute to listening and supporting others psychologically. This has potential implications for skilling clinicians and the public about responding to mental distress. As frontline health-care workers, general practitioners may themselves need to be recipients of psychological first aid and support as they deal with adverse consequences of the quarantine period.","Ng","https://doi.org/10.1071/HC20030","20200702","Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; New Zealand; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health in chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece","To investigate the effect of the time spent on quarantine on distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization of chronic disease patients during the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece and the differences in these parameters between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients. The sample consisted of 943 healthy individuals and 163 patients (respiratory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, endocrine, patients with other diseases, and patients with more than one disease) completing sociodemographic assessments as well as the 4-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) during March 30, 2020 to May 3, 2020. Pearson's correlation was used to search for the association between time spent on quarantine and the 4DSQ subscales (distress, anxiety, depression, and somatization). Independent sample T-test and Glass's Î” were used for differences between healthy individuals and chronic disease patients in these subscales, an analysis also carried out between healthy individuals and all patient subgroups. No statistically significant correlations were noted between the 4DSQ subscales and the quarantine duration, both for the patient and the healthy individuals' group. Chronic disease patients had significantly higher levels of distress (p = 0.001, Î” = 0.28) and somatization (p = 0.000, Î” = 0.47), but not there were no significant differences in anxiety (p = 0.098, Î” = 0.14) and depression (p = 0.052, Î” = 0.19). Concerning head-to-head comparisons between the healthy individuals' group and each patient group, significantly higher scores in distress were found only for patients with respiratory diseases (p = 0.028, Î” = 0.42). Regarding somatization, significantly higher scores were noted for the healthy individuals' group compared with patients with autoimmune diseases (p = 0.010, Î” = 0.62), respiratory diseases (p = 0.027, Î” = 0.42), other diseases (p = 0.003, Î” = 0.55), and more than one disease (p = 0.012, Î” = 0.60). No statistically significant differences were found in anxiety and depression. The results of this study indicate that interventional programs for chronic disease patients during quarantine should focus on distress and somatization, not on anxiety and depression. Respiratory patients might have more supportive care needs compared with patients with other diseases.","Louvardi, Pelekasis, Chrousos, Darviri","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1478951520000528","20200717","Asthma; Autoimmune; Cardiovascular; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Addressing the mental health concerns of migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: An experiential account","The COVID pandemic has affected the world in a drastic manner taking a toll of not only human lives but also the economy and lifestyle. Of all the population suffering, the underprivileged and vulnerable groups have faced the maximum economic burden. Within India, an ample quota of people migrates annually for elementary occupations in service, sales, building and domestic industries. Generally, they are exposed to discrimination, work-rights exploitation and job insecurity. The onset of COVID 19 has accentuated these issues in unprecedented ways. The Apex Court of the country took note of this plight and gave directions to the governments to take care of the immediate needs of the migrant workers. This article attempts to reflect the mental health concerns of the migrant workers who were temporarily sheltered at relief camps across Bengaluru city in the state of Karnataka, during the ongoing COVID pandemic.

"Evaluation of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on hair diseases through a web-based questionnaire","Current quarantine conditions are a difficult process for individuals and can worsen the psychological state. Increased psychosocial stress can affect the course of many common &quot;stress-sensitive&quot; skin conditions. This study examined the possible effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on hair and scalp diseases such as telogen effluvium (TE), alopecia areata (AA), and seborrheic dermatitis (SD) in individuals who had to stay at home for a long time and the patients' methods of dealing with these diseases. The study was conducted using an online questionnaire. All the individuals were asked questions about pre- and post-pandemic TE, AA, and SD. Participants with complaints were asked what they did for treatment. During the pandemic, TE was seen in 27.9% of the participants, AA on the scalp was seen in 2.8%, AA on the face was seen in 2.5%, and SD was seen in 19.9%. Applying to a dermatologist for complaints during the pandemic was lower than before pandemic. TE was higher in women before and during the pandemic. It was found that the rates of referring to a dermatologist for the complaints before the pandemic varied between 15% and 28% and that these rates decreased significantly during the pandemic (2.5%-12.5%).","Turkmen, Altunisik, Sener, Colak","https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.13923","20200717","COVID-19; alopecia areata; hair diseases; seborrheic dermatitis; telogen effluvium","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In an effort to assure accordance with these instructions, equitable strategies for at-risk and vulnerable populations and communities are warranted. One such strategy was our community conference calls, implemented to disseminate information on the pandemic and allow community leaders to discuss struggles and successes. Over the first 6 weeks, we held 12 calls, averaging 125 (standard deviation 41) participants. Participants were primarily from congregations and faith-based organizations that had an established relationship with the hospital, but also included school leaders, elected officials, and representatives of housing associations. Issues discussed included reasons for quarantining, mental health, social isolation, health disparities, and ethical concerns regarding hospital resources. Concerns identified by the community leaders as barriers to effective quarantining and adherence to precautions included food access, housing density, and access to screening and testing. Through the calls, ways to solve such challenges were addressed, with novel strategies and resources reaching the community. This medical-religious resource has proven feasible and valuable during the pandemic and warrants discussions on reproducing it for other communities during this and future infectious disease outbreaks.","Galiatsatos, Monson, Oluyinka, Negro, Hughes, Maydan, Golden, Teague, Hale","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-020-01057-w","20200702","COVID19; Community engagement; Medicalâ€“religious partnerships","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The immediate impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on subjective sleep status","An outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been ongoing in China since January 2020. The threat of infection affects the work and life of most of the population and may alsoÂ damage sleep. This study aims to examine the subjective sleep status and mental health of the population during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. The data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups. A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed. The results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19. As prevention and treatment efforts continue with regard to COVID-19, the general public has developed poor sleep hygiene habits, which deserve attention.","Lin, Wang, Ou-Yang, Miao, Chen, Liang, Zhang, Tang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.018","20200628","2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19); Insomnia; Insomnia severity index (ISI); SARS-CoV-2; Subjective sleep","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India","COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle.","Choudhari","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102254","20200722","COVID 19; Internal migrants; Mental health; Occupational health; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2; Worker","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Cultural orientation, power, belief in conspiracy theories, and intentions to reduce the spread of COVID-19","The current study investigated cultural and psychological factors associated with intentions to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Participants (nÂ =Â 704) completed measures of individualism-collectivism, belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19, feelings of powerlessness, and intentions to engage in behaviours that reduce the spread of COVID-19. Results revealed that vertical individualism negatively predicted intentions to engage in social distancing, directly and indirectly through both belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories and feelings of powerlessness. Vertical collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions directly. Horizontal collectivism positively predicted social distancing intentions indirectly through feelings of powerlessness. Finally, horizontal collectivism positively predicted hygiene-related intentions both directly and indirectly through lower feelings of powerlessness. These findings suggest that promoting collectivism may be a way to increase engagement with efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

"Mental health circumstances among health care workers and general public under the pandemic situation of COVID-19 (HOME-COVID-19)","After the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) globally, upgraded quarantine and physical distancing strategy, strict infection measures, and government's strict lockdown have been abided to confront the spread of the COVID-19 in Thailand. During the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about the mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population are now arising. Yet, information on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population have not been comprehensively reported in Thailand. As such, we conduct a cross-sectional study, a national online survey to describe the short- and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population in Thailand. This study is a repeated cross-sectional study, an open online voluntary national-based survey during the wave I (April 21-May 4, 2020) follow-up in the wave II (August 3-16, 2020), wave III (November 15-28, 2020), and a 1-year follow-up survey (wave IV: April 21-May 4, 2021) in Thailand. Health care workers at the hospitals and the adult general population will be invited to participate in the online survey via the SurveyMonkey that limits one-time participation per unique internet protocol address. The target sample size of at least 1182 health care workers and 1310 general populations will be required to complete the online survey for each wave of the survey. Sociodemographic characteristics and a set of measurement tools for mental and psychosocial problems for each subcohort including depression, anxiety, stress, resilient copings, neuroticism, perceived social support, wellbeing, somatic symptoms, insomnia, burnout (for healthcare workers), and public stigma toward COVID-19 infection (for the general population) will be collected. For all estimates of prevalence, we will weigh data for all wave analyses under the complex design of the survey. Subgroup analyses stratified by key characteristics will also be done to analyze the proportion differences. For the repeated cross-sectional survey, we will combine the data from the wave I to wave IV survey to analyze changes in the mental health status. We will perform multilevel logistic regression models with random intercepts to explore associations with individual-level and region-level/hospital-level predictors. We also plan to perform an ancillary systematic review and meta-analysis by incorporating data from our findings to all available evidence. Our findings will provide information on the short- and long-term mental health status as well as the psychosocial responses to the COVID-19 outbreak in a national sample of health care workers and the general population in Thailand. This prospective, nationally based, a repeated cross-sectional study will describe the mental health status and psychosocial problems among health care workers and the general population in Thailand during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on healthcare workers' mental health","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China, commonly presents as a severe acute respiratory disease referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). The rapid spread of the disease created challenges for healthcare systems and forced healthcare workers to grapple with clinical and nonclinical stressors, including shortages of personal protective equipment, mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19, fear of bringing the virus home to family members, and the reality of losing colleagues to the disease. Evidence from previous outbreaks, along with early evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that these events have significant short- and long-term effects on the mental health of healthcare workers. All healthcare stakeholders should create short- and long-term plans to support the mental health of workers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hall","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.JAA.0000669772.78848.8c","20200702","Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Grief; Health Personnel; Hong Kong; Humans; Mental Health; Ontario; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Taiwan; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological distress, coping behaviors, and preferences for support among New York healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","The mental health toll of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCW) is not yet fully described. We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th-April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (nÂ =Â 657). Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources. Programs developed to mitigate stress among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic should integrate HCW preferences.","Shechter, Diaz, Moise, Anstey, Ye, Agarwal, Birk, Brodie, Cannone, Chang, Claassen, Cornelius, Derby, Dong, Givens, Hochman, Homma, Kronish, Lee, Manzano, Mayer, McMurry, Moitra, Pham, Rabbani, Rivera, Schwartz, Schwartz, Shapiro, Shaw, Sullivan, Vose, Wasson, Edmondson, Abdalla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.007","20200724","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping; Depression; Distress; Healthcare worker; Insomnia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness explain the associations of COVID-19 social and economic consequences to suicide risk","The social and economic consequences of COVID-19 and related public health interventions aimed at slowing the spread of the virus have been proposed to increase suicide risk. However, no research has examined these relations. This study examined the relations of two COVID-19 consequences (i.e., stay-at-home orders and job loss) to suicide risk through thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and loneliness. Online data from a nationwide community sample of 500 adults (mean ageÂ =Â 40) from 45 states were collected between March 27 and April 5, 2020. Participants completed measures assessing thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, loneliness, and suicide risk, as well as whether they (a) were currently under a stay-at-home order and (b) had experienced a recent job loss due to the pandemic. Results revealed a significant indirect relation of stay-at-home order status to suicide risk through thwarted belongingness. Further, whereas recent job loss was significantly correlated with suicide risk, neither the direct relation of job loss to suicide risk (when accounting for their shared relations to perceived burdensomeness) nor the indirect relation through perceived burdensomeness was significant. Results highlight the potential benefits of interventions targeting thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness to offset suicide risk during this pandemic.","Gratz, Tull, Richmond, Edmonds, Scamaldo, Rose","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12654","20200724",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Associations among state-level physical distancing measures and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among US adults during the early COVID-19 pandemic","The purpose of this study was to identify leading sources of stress, describe rates of mental health outcomes, and examine their associations among U.S. adults during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a cross-sectional, general population survey conducted from March 18 to April 4, 2020, U.S. adults (nÂ =Â 10,625) were recruited through Qualtrics Panels using quota sampling methods. Life stressors, probable depression, past-month suicide ideation, and past-month suicide attempts were not elevated among participants subject to state-level stay-at-home orders and/or large gathering bans. Multiple life stressors were associated with increased rates of probable depression. Past-month suicide ideation was significantly higher among participants reporting ongoing arguments with a partner and serious legal problems. Past-month suicide attempt was significantly higher among participants reporting concerns about a life-threatening illness or injury, but was significantly lower among participants reporting an unexpected bill or expense. Results failed to support the conclusion that physical distancing measures are correlated with worse mental health outcomes. Concerns about life-threatening illness or injury were uniquely associated with increased risk of suicide attempt.","Bryan, Bryan, Baker","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12653","20200724",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How bad is it? Suicidality in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic","The current paper examines the intersection between social vulnerability, individual risk, and social/psychological resources with adult suicidality during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data come from a national sample (nÂ =Â 10,368) of U.S. adults. Using an online platform, information was gathered during the third week of March 2020, and post-stratification weighted to proportionally represent the U.S. population in terms of age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, and geography. Nearly 15 percent of sampled respondents were categorized as high risk, scoring 7+ on the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R). This level of risk varied across social vulnerability groupings: Blacks, Native Americans, Hispanics, families with children, unmarried, and younger respondents reported higher SBQ-R scores than their counterparts (pÂ &lt;Â .000). Regression results confirm these bivariate differences and also reveal that risk factors (food insecurity, physical symptoms, and CES-D symptomatology) are positive and significantly related to suicidality (pÂ &lt;Â .000). Additionally, resource measures are significant and negatively related to suicidality (pÂ &lt;Â .000). These results provide some insight on the impact COVID-19 is having on the general U.S. Practitioners should be prepared for what will likely be a significant mental health fall-out in the months and years ahead.","Fitzpatrick, Harris, Drawve","https://doi.org/10.1111/sltb.12655","20200724",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around: Couple and Family Coping During the Corona Virus Pandemic","The worldwide corona virus (COVID-19) has had profound effects on all aspects of life: physical health, the ability to travel locally or to more distant destinations, material and financial resources, and psychosocial wellbeing. Couples, families, and communities and individual persons in those relationships have struggled to cope with emerging depression, anxiety, and trauma, and the rise of relational conflict. In this article, we suggest that the existential nature of the pandemic's challenges require more than just the usual psychosocial interventions. We propose a taxonomy of responses to foster coping and resilience - &quot;Reaching Up, Down, In, and Around&quot;. &quot;Reaching Up&quot; includes accessing spiritual, religious, and ethical values. &quot;Reaching Down&quot; includes ideas and practices that foster a revised relationship with the Earth and its resources, and that engage families to participate in activities that aid the Earth's recovery from decades of human-caused damage. &quot;Reaching In&quot; represents a turn towards experiences available in the mind and in shared minds in relationships that provide pleasure, excitement, joy, and peace, given that external sources of these emotions are of limited availability due to quarantine. &quot;Reaching Around&quot; involves reframing the mandate for &quot;social distancing&quot; as fostering social connection and support while maintaining physical distancing. The challenges for family therapists, whose practices are confined largely to online therapy, and who are struggling with the same fears and constraints as those persons they are attempting to help, are also discussed.","Fraenkel, Cho","https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12570","20200717",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Physical activity in a pandemic: A new treatment target for psychological therapy","The COVID-19 pandemic and its management are placing significant new strains on people's well-being, particularly those with pre-existing mental health conditions. Physical activity has been shown to improve mental as well as physical health. Increasing activity levels should be prioritized as a treatment target, especially when the barriers to exercise are greater than ever. Promoting physical activity has not traditionally been the remit of psychologists. Yet psychological theory and therapeutic techniques can be readily applied to address physical inactivity. We present theoretical perspectives and therapy techniques relating to (1) beliefs about physical activity, (2) motivation to be physically active, and (3) the sense of reward achieved through being physically active. We outline strategies to initiate and maintain physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby benefitting mental and physical health. COVID-19 is demanding rapid and substantial change across the whole health care system. Psychological therapists can respond creatively by addressing physical activity, a treatable clinical target which delivers both mental and physical health benefits. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Physical activity is essential for our mental and physical health. Yet COVID-19 presents novel barriers to physical activity. Psychological theory and techniques to address beliefs, motivation, and reward can be applied to increase physical activity during COVID-19. Physical activity is an important clinical target to sustain and improve mental health, especially in the current pandemic.","Diamond, Waite","https://doi.org/10.1111/papt.12294","20200717","COVID-19; exercise; psychological techniques; sedentary behaviour","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Evaluating the Mental Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Urban South Africa: Perceived Risk of COVID-19 Infection and Childhood Trauma Predict Adult Depressive Symptoms","South Africa's national lockdown introduced serious threats to public mental health in a society where one in three individuals develop a psychiatric disorder during their life. We aimed to evaluate the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using a mixed methods design. This longitudinal study drew from a preexisting sample of 957 adults living in Soweto, a major township near Johannesburg. Psychological assessments were administered across two waves: between August 2019-March 2020 and during the first six weeks of the lockdown (late March-early May 2020). Interviews on COVID-19 experiences were administered in the second wave. Multiple regression models examined relationships between perceived COVID-19 risk and depression. Full data on perceived COVID-19 risk, depression, and covariates were available in 221 adults. 14.5% of adults were at risk for depression. Higher perceived COVID-19 risk predicted greater depressive symptoms (p &lt; 0.001) particularly among adults with histories of childhood trauma, though this effect was marginally significant (p = 0.062). Adults were two times more likely to experience significant depressive symptoms for every one unit increase in perceived COVID-19 risk (p = 0.016; 95% CI [1.14, 3.49]). Qualitative data identified potent experiences of anxiety, financial insecurity, fear of infection, and rumination. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 infection is associated with greater depressive symptoms among adults with histories of childhood trauma during the first six weeks of quarantine. High rates of severe mental illness and low availability of mental healthcare amidst COVID-19 emphasize the need for immediate and accessible psychological resources in South Africa.","Kim, Nyengerai, Mendenhall","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.13.20130120","20200702",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Emotional health concerns of oncology physicians in the United States: fallout during the COVID-19 pandemic","Cancer care is significantly impacted by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the pandemic on the emotional well-being of oncology providers across the United States and explore factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms. A cross-sectional survey was administered to United States cancer-care physicians recruited over a two-week period (3/27/2020-4/10/2020) using snowball-convenience sampling through social media. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Of 486 participants, 374 (77.0%) completed the PHQ-4: mean age 45.7 +/- 9.6 years; 63.2% female; all oncologic specialties were represented. The rates of anxiety and depression symptoms were 62.0% and 23.5%, respectively. Demographic factors associated with anxiety included female sex, younger age, and less time in clinical practice. Perception of inadequate PPE (68.6% vs. 57.4%, p=0.03) and practicing in a state with more COVID-19 cases (65.8% vs. 51.1%, p=0.01) were associated with anxiety symptoms. Factors significantly associated with both anxiety and depression included: degree to which COVID-19 has interfered with the ability to provide treatment to cancer patients and concern that patients will not receive the level of care needed for non-COVID-19 illness (all p-values &lt;0.01). The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms among oncology physicians in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic is high. Our findings highlight factors associated with and sources of psychological distress to be addressed to protect the well-being of oncology physicians.","Thomaier, Teoh, Jewett, Beckwith, Parsons, Yuan, Blaes, Lou, Hui, Vogel","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.11.20128702","20200626",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Assessing visible aerosol generation during vitrectomy in the era of Covid-19","To assess visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery. A model comprising a human cadaveric corneoscleral rim mounted on an artificial anterior chamber was used. Three-port 25 gauge vitrectomy simulated surgery was performed with any visible aerosol production recorded using high-speed 4K camera. The following were assessed: (1) vitrector at maximum cut rate in static and dynamic conditions inside the model, (2) vitrector at air-fluid interface in a physical model, (3) passive fluid-air exchange with a backflush hand piece, (4) valved cannulas under air, and (5) a defective valved cannula under air. No visible aerosol or droplets were identified when the vitrector was used within the model. In the physical model, no visible aerosol or droplets were seen when the vitrector was engaged at the air-fluid interface. Droplets were produced from the opening of backflush hand piece during passive fluid-air exchange. No visible aerosol was produced from the intact valved cannulas under air pressure, but droplets were seen at the beginning of fluid-air exchange when the valved cannula was defective. We found no evidence of visible aerosol generation during simulated vitrectomy surgery with competent valved cannulas. In the physical model, no visible aerosol was generated by the high-speed vitrector despite cutting at the air-fluid interface.","Liyanage, Ramasamy, Elhaddad, Darcy, Hudson, Keller","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-020-1052-4","20200629",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Voices from the frontline: findings from a thematic analysis of a rapid online global survey of maternal and newborn health professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially impacted maternity care provision worldwide. Studies based on modelling estimated large indirect effects of the pandemic on services and health outcomes. The objective of this study was to prospectively document experiences of frontline maternal and newborn healthcare providers. We conducted a global, cross-sectional study of maternal and newborn health professionals via an online survey disseminated through professional networks and social media in 12 languages. Information was collected between 24 March and 10 April 2020 on respondents' background, preparedness for and response to COVID-19 and their experience during the pandemic. An optional module sought information on adaptations to 17 care processes. Descriptive statistics and qualitative thematic analysis were used to analyse responses, disaggregating by low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). We analysed responses from 714 maternal and newborn health professionals. Only one-third received training on COVID-19 from their health facility and nearly all searched for information themselves. Half of respondents in LMICs received updated guidelines for care provision compared with 82% in HICs. Overall, 47% of participants in LMICs and 69% in HICs felt mostly or completely knowledgeable in how to care for COVID-19 maternity patients. Facility-level responses to COVID-19 (signage, screening, testing and isolation rooms) were more common in HICs than LMICs. Globally, 90% of respondents reported somewhat or substantially higher levels of stress. There was a widespread perception of reduced use of routine maternity care services, and of modification in care processes, some of which were not evidence-based practices. Substantial knowledge gaps exist in guidance on management of maternity cases with or without COVID-19. Formal information-sharing channels for providers must be established and mental health support provided. Surveys of maternity care providers can help track the situation, capture innovations and support rapid development of effective responses.","Semaan, Audet, Huysmans, Afolabi, Assarag, Banke-Thomas, Blencowe, Caluwaerts, Campbell, Cavallaro, Chavane, Day, Delamou, Delvaux, Graham, Gon, Kascak, Matsui, Moxon, Nakimuli, Pembe, Radovich, van den Akker, Benova","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-002967","20200714","child health; cross-sectional survey; health services research; health systems; maternal health; Betacoronavirus; Child Health Services; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health Services; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Poverty; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Using syndemic theory to understand food insecurity and diet-related chronic diseases","Syndemic Theory (ST) provides a framework to examine mutually enhancing diseases/health issues under conditions of social inequality and inequity. ST has been used in multiple disciplines to address interacting infectious diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and mental health conditions. The theory has been critiqued for its inability to measure disease interactions and their individual and combined health outcomes. This article reviews literature that strongly suggests a syndemic between food insecurity (FI) and diet-related chronic diseases (DRCDs), and proposes a model to measure the extent of such interaction. The article seeks to: (1) examine the potential syndemic between FI and DRCDs; (2) illustrate how the incorporation of Life History Theory (LHT), into a syndemic framework can help to highlight critical lifeperiods when FI-DRCD interactions result in adverse health outcomes; (3) discuss the use of mixed methods to identify and measure syndemics to enhance the precision and predictive power of ST; and (4) propose an analytical model for the examination of the FI-DRCD syndemic through the life course. The proposed model is more relevant now given the significant increase in FI globally as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The differential impact that the pandemic appears to have among various age groups and by other demographic factors (e.g., race, gender, income) offers an opportunity to examine the potential FI-DRCD syndemic under the lens of LHT.","Himmelgreen, Romero-Daza, Heuer, Lucas, Salinas-Miranda, Stoddard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113124","20200626","Diet-related chronic diseases; Food insecurity; Life history theory; Medical anthropology; Public health; Syndemics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

From 17 January 2020 to 24 January 2020, insomnia, anxiety and physical symptoms were evaluated online, and they were followed up for 4 and 8â€‰weeks. Main outcomes and indicators were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and each factor score, the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), respectively. In addition, insomnia, anxiety and physical symptoms were assessed at baseline and at the end of fourth and eighth weeks. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare the changes in patients' scale scores at different time points.

The cross-sectional data were collected using the time-lag design to avoid the common method bias as much as possible. Regression results using structural equation modeling show that the internalized stigmatization of epicenter travel experiences may have positive relationships with mental health problems (i.e., anxiety, depression, and shame), and such relationships can be moderated by social support. Specifically, the positive relationships between internalized stigmatization and mental health problems are buffered/strengthened when social support is at a high/low level. The findings of this study suggest that, in this epidemic, people who have epicenter travel experience could be affected by internalized stigmatization, no matter whether they have ever got infected.","Li, Liang, Yuan, Zeng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124507","20200710","internalized stigmatization; mental health problems; social support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Threat of COVID-19 and emotional state during quarantine: Positive and negative affect as mediators in a cross-sectional study of the Spanish population","The objective of this study was therefore to analyze the effect of exceptionally stressful situations, such as the current health risk, on the cognitive and emotive state of the individual, that is, perceived threat and emotional state on affect and mood. This was a cross-sectional study with snowball sampling. The sample came to 1014 Spanish adults (67.2% women and 32.8% men). The Perception of Threat from COVID-19 questionnaire, the Affective Balance Scale and the Mood Evaluation Scale were used. The results showed that the perception of threat from COVID-19 was related positively to negative affect and emotional signs, that is, sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility. There was a direct positive effect of perceived threat from COVID-19 on sadness-depression, anxiety and anger-hostility moods, while anxiety and anger-hostility had a direct positive effect on perception of threat from the virus. Thus, there was a circular relationship, in which perceived threat influenced the presence of negative mood, and negative mood, in turn, linked to emotions of irritation and agitation from a present situation, promoted the feeling of threat. A negative affective balance increases both one's perception of threat from COVID-19 and negative mood. Thus, knowing the emotional and cognitive effects on the population would enable measures to be put into service to facilitate their effective coping.","PÃ©rez-Fuentes, Molero Jurado, Martos MartÃ­nez, GÃ¡zquez Linares","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0235305","20200713","Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Aged; Anger; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Female; Hostility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Positive Correlation Between General Public Knowledge and Attitudes Regarding COVID-19 Outbreak 1Â Month After First Cases Reported in Indonesia","The increasing number cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infections in the general population in Indonesia raises questions concerning the public's knowledge and attitudes regarding this pandemic. To determine the correlation between the general public's knowledge and attitudes regarding the COVID-19 outbreak 1Â month after the first cases were reported in Indonesia. This cross-sectional study was conducted between early March and the end of April 2020 in the general population of Indonesia, beginning with the North Sumatra region, where the spread of COVID-19 in Indonesia began. Questionnaires were randomly distributed online in the red zone in Indonesia. Data were collected by collecting people's responses to the questionnaire, which were distributed via WhatsApp (WA) application and were competed independently by the participants. A descriptive analysis was conducted to describe the demographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitudes of the general population. A total of 201 people had good knowledge (98%) and a positive attitude (96%) regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. The respondents had a negative attitude in relation to two aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: having to always maintain a distance of 1.5Â m when in crowds, and not being able to regularly exercise or eat nutritious food (78.6% and 79.1%, respectively). Most people in Indonesia have good knowledge and a positive attitude regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. However, negative attitudes were still found in this study, and as a result, transmission prevention measures cannot reach their maximum effectiveness by simply publicizing the increase in day-to-day cases to the general public.","Sari, Amelia, Dharmajaya, Sari, Fitri","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10900-020-00866-0","20200627","COVID-19; New cases; Prevention; Public health; Response; Transmission","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Activity and Health During the SARS-CoV2 Pandemic (ASAP): Study Protocol for a Multi-National Network Trial","<b>Introduction:</b> The worldwide spread of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has prompted numerous countries to restrict public life. Related measures, such as limits on social gatherings, business closures, or lockdowns, are expected to considerably reduce the individual opportunities to move outside the home. As physical activity (PA) and sport participation significantly contribute to health, this study has two objectives. The objectives of this study are to assess changes in PA and well-being since the coronavirus outbreak in affected countries. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of digital home-based exercise programs on PA as well as physical and mental health outcomes. <b>Method:</b> A multinational network trial will be conducted with three planned phases (A, B, and C). Part A consists of administering a structured survey. It investigates changes in PA levels and health during the coronavirus outbreak and measures the preferences of the participants regarding online training programs. Part B is a two-armed randomized-controlled trial. Participants assigned to the intervention group (IG) will complete a digital 4-week home exercise training (live streaming via internet) guided by the survey results on content and time of program. The control group (CG) will not receive the program. Part C is 4-week access of both CG and IG to a digital archive of pre-recorded workouts from Part B. Similar to Part A, questionnaires will be used in both Part B and C to estimate the effects of exercise on measures of mental and physical health. <b>Results and Discussion:</b> The ASAP project will provide valuable insights into the importance of PA during a global pandemic. Our initial survey is the first to determine how governmental confinement measures impact bodily and mental well-being. Based on the results, the intervention studies will be unique to address health problems potentially arising from losses in PA. If proven effective, the newly developed telehealth programs could become a significant and easy-to-distribute factor in combating PA decreases. Results of the study may hence guide policy makers on methods to maintain PA and health when being forced to restrict public life. <b>Study Register:</b> DRKS00021273.","Wilke, Mohr, Tenforde, Vogel, Hespanhol, Vogt, Verhagen, Hollander","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00302","20200626","coronavirus; e-health; exercise; home-based; isolation; physical activity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"'Quit During COVID-19'-staying smokefree in mental health in-patient settings","Cigarette smoking is one of the main preventable causes of cancers globally. At this time of global emergency, mental health professionals all over the world are joining hands with the public health and other healthcare communities to focus on acute measures to save lives from COVID-19. This has been particularly challenging in mental health hospital settings where numerous additional factors need to be considered, including difficulties of implementing social distancing, potential impacts of social isolation, increased stress levels and implications of all this on smoking. In this article, we will briefly discuss the prevalence of smoking in mental health patients, especially in those in mental health hospital settings and also what is the possible impact of COVID-19 pandemic in these people. Then we will go through the main reasons as to why encouraging smoking cessation in mental health patients is so important and measures we can take for supporting mental health patients quit smoking even during COVID-19 times.

The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has exacerbated these mental health risks brought about by isolation and exhaustion. Delegated to be a national COVID-19 referral centre, the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital faced many challenges, including the increased workload in a perilous and anxiety-inducing national crisis which placed the entire healthcare team in an unprecedented situation. To adapt to these challenges, the Division of Medical Oncology employed the following measures to safeguard the mental health of its faculty and fellows: 1) use of psychological support materials; 2) initiation of a psychological intervention programme and 3) establishment of peer support programmes. Caring for the carers through evidence-based interventions ensures the delivery of quality care to our cancer patients despite the challenges during these trying times.","Leones, Berba, Chua, Sandoval-Tan","https://doi.org/10.3332/ecancer.2020.1057","20200626","COVID-19; mental health; oncologist","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

For this we analyzed secondary data obtained from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study draws from a wide range of data sources to quantify global and regional effects of a disease. We also did a literature search on the effects of COVID-19 illness on mental health and the psychosocial effects of COVID-19 and other Corona virus related illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Data from the studies obtained was utilized to extrapolate the anticipated effects of COVID-19 illness on healthcare workers, COVID-19 patients and the general public in Pakistan. Mental illness poses a significant challenge to Pakistan's under resourced health care system. COVID-19 has the potential to strain Pakistan's healthcare system to the breaking point. So far, the general morbidity from COVID-19 illness in Pakistan has been low compared to other countries but this could change in the coming weeks and months.

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Adult Mental Health","The outbreak of the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) in December 2019 has progressed to the status of a global pandemic, with countries across the seven continents adversely affected and the number of human cases exceeding two million. With no available vaccine, the treatment is primarily symptomatic for those affected and preventative for those at risk. Most countries have taken action to curtail the spread of COVID-19 through measures such as lockdowns, social distancing and voluntary self-isolation. Whilst necessary, such measures and the disease itself, may have an adverse impact on mental health. In view of research from previous pandemic crises, it is known that such situations are likely to increase stress levels and have negative psychiatric effects. The impact is likely to be felt by the general public, sufferers of COVID-19, their families and friends, persons with pre-existing mental health conditions and healthcare workers.","Haider, Tiwana, Tahir","https://doi.org/10.12669/pjms.36.COVID19-S4.2756","20200626","COVID-19; Mental Health; Pandemic Impact","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Impact of Quarantine and Physical Distancing Following COVID-19 on Mental Health: Study Protocol of a Multicentric Italian Population Trial","The COVID-19 pandemic and its related containment measures-mainly physical distancing and isolation-are having detrimental consequences on the mental health of the general population worldwide. In particular, frustration, loneliness, and worries about the future are common reactions and represent well-known risk factors for several mental disorders, including anxiety, affective, and post-traumatic stress disorders. The vast majority of available studies have been conducted in China, where the pandemic started. Italy has been severely hit by the pandemic, and the socio-cultural context is completely different from Eastern countries. Therefore, there is the need for methodologically rigorous studies aiming to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 and quarantine measures on the mental health of the Italian population. In fact, our results will help us to develop appropriate interventions for managing the psychosocial consequences of pandemic. The &quot;COVID-IT-mental health trial&quot; is a no-profit, not-funded, national, multicentric, cross-sectional population-based trial which has the following aims: a) to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and its containment measures on mental health of the Italian population; b) to identify the main areas to be targeted by supportive long-term interventions for the different categories of people exposed to the pandemic. Data will be collected through a web-platform using validated assessment tools. Participants will be subdivided into four groups: a) Group 1-COVID-19 quarantine group. This group includes the general population which are quarantined but not isolated, i.e., those not directly exposed to contagion nor in contact with COVID-19+ individuals; b) Group 2-COVID-19+ group, which includes isolated people directly/indirectly exposed to the virus; c) Group 3-COVID-19 healthcare staff group, which includes first- and second-line healthcare professionals; d) Group 4-COVID-19 mental health, which includes users of mental health services and all those who had already been diagnosed with a mental disorder. Mental health services worldwide are not prepared yet to manage the short- and long-term consequences of the pandemic. It is necessary to have a clear picture of the impact that this new stressor will have on mental health and well-being in order to develop and disseminate appropriate interventions for the general population and for the other at-risk groups.","Giallonardo, Sampogna, Del Vecchio, Luciano, Albert, Carmassi, CarrÃ , Cirulli, Dell'Osso, Nanni, Pompili, Sani, Tortorella, Volpe, Fiorillo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00533","20200626","anxiety; burn-out; depression; global mental health; pandemic; post-traumatic stress disorder; resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This Facebook survey study aimed to investigate the COVID-19-related factors that were associated with sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts among members of the public during the COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. The online survey recruited 1970 participants through a Facebook advertisement. Their self-reported experience of sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts in the previous week were collected along with a number of COVID-19-related factors, including level of worry, change in social interaction and daily lives, any academic/occupational interference, levels of social and specific support, and self-reported physical health. In total, 55.8% of the participants reported sleep disturbance, and 10.8% reported having suicidal thoughts in the previous week. Multiple COVID-19-related factors were associated with sleep disturbance and suicidal thoughts in the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased worry about COVID-19, more severe impact of COVID-19 on social interaction, lower perceived social support, more severe academic/occupational interference due to COVID-19, lower COVID-19-specified support, and poorer self-reported physical health were significantly associated with sleep disturbance. Less handwashing, lower perceived social support, lower COVID-19-specified support, poorer self-reported physical health, and younger age were significantly associated with suicidal thoughts.

"COVID-19: Catastrophic Cause of Acute Lung Injury","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak that began in 2019 and spread rapidly across the globe has been observed to cause acute lung injury and multiorgan system failure. While common symptoms are flu-like, this population has been observed to decompensate at an alarmingly rapid rate to severe hypoxia. SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by targeting the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is present on endothelial cells in the lung, heart, kidney, and gastrointestinal tissue. The pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in SARS-CoV-2 infection has a component of lung perfusion dysregulation and is described as a &quot;cytokine storm&quot; that causes increased vascular permeability and disease severity. Older adults and those with comorbid conditions, particularly hypertension, diabetes, and history of ischemic heart disease, are especially vulnerable. These high-risk populations are often on angiotensin-modulating therapies, which are theorized to increase ACE2 expressivity, but current evidence for or against discontinuation is equivocal. The standard for SARS-CoV-2 testing is through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, which has presented problems due to low sensitivity and possible co-infection with other pathogens. Treatment for ARDS in the setting of SARS-CoV-2 should follow pre-established goals of care and the wishes of the patient and family members or caregivers and consider the high risk for polypharmacy, cognitive decline, malnutrition, and depression, particularly in older adults. Treatment recommendations have outlined ventilation goals to minimize further lung injury. Compassionate use of pharmacologic therapies such as remdesivir has shown promise, and further clinical trials of anticytokine agents are underway.","Cai, McClafferty, Benson, Ramgobin, Kalayanamitra, Shahid, Groff, Aggarwal, Patel, Polimera, Vunnam, Golamari, Sahu, Bhatt, Jain","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19:+Catastrophic+Cause+of+Acute+Lung+Injury.","20200629","Acute Lung Injury; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Endothelial Cells; Humans; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health status of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak in Jordan: A cross-sectional study","The emergence of COVID-19 global pandemic coupled with high transmission rate and mortality has created an unprecedented state of emergency worldwide. This global situation may have a negative impact on the psychological well-being of individuals which in turn impacts individuals' performance. This study aims to explore the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the GP, HCPs, and USs during COVID-19 outbreak, and to identify key population(s) who might need psychological intervention. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted in Jordan between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status (depression and anxiety) of the general population, healthcare professionals, and university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety among the study participants. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of depression and anxiety. The prevalence of depression and anxiety among the entire study participants was 23.8% and 13.1%, respectively. Anxiety was most prevalent across university students 21.5%, followed by healthcare professionals 11.3%, and general population 8.8%. Females among healthcare professionals and university students, divorced healthcare professionals, pulmonologists, and university students with history of chronic disease were at higher risk of developing depression. Females, divorced participants among the general population, and university students with history of chronic disease and those with high income (â‰¥1,500Â JD) were at higher risk of developing anxiety. During outbreaks, individuals are put under extreme stressful condition resulting in higher risk of developing anxiety and depression particularly for students and healthcare professionals.

Four hundred and three participants were asked to complete a questionnaire with questions around symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and family affluence. The results indicated that people who do not have enough supplies to sustain the lockdown were most affected, and family affluence was found to be negatively correlated with stress, anxiety, and depression. Among different professions, students and healthcare professionals were found to experience stress, anxiety, and depression more than others. Despite the current situation, stress, anxiety, and depression were found to be in normal ranges for mental health professionals highlighting their capabilities to remain normal in times of distress. Policymakers and other authorities may take the assistance of mental health professionals to help overcome psychological issues related to Covid-19.","Rehman, Shahnawaz, Khan, Kharshiing, Khursheed, Gupta, Kashyap, Uniyal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-020-00664-x","20200626","Anxiety; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Depression; India; Mental health professionals; Stress; Students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychosocial factors and hospitalisations for COVID-19: Prospective cohort study of the general population","To examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. Prospective cohort study. England. UK Biobank comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 in England between 16th March and 26th April 2020 as provided by Public Health England. There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 people. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function: verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend &lt;=0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function was most robust to statistical adjustment.","Batty, Deary, Luciano, Altschul, Kivimaki, Gale","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.29.20100735","20200627",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Emergency medicine physician burnout and wellness in Canada before COVID19: A national survey","Emergency medicine (EM) is a high-risk specialty for burnout. COVID-19 has had and will continue to have important consequences on wellness and burnout for EM physicians in Canada. Baseline data are crucial to monitor the health of EM physicians in Canada, and evaluate any interventions designed to help during and after COVID-19. To describe the rates of burnout, depression, and suicidality in practicing EM physicians in Canada, just before the COVID-19 pandemic. A modified snowball method was used for survey distribution. Participants completed the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Health Services Tool (MBI-HSS), a screening measure for depression (PHQ-9), and a question regarding if the physician had ever or in the past 12 months contemplated suicide. A total of 384 respondent surveys were included in the final analysis: 86.1% (329/382) met at least one of the criteria for burnout, 58% (217/374) scored minimal to none on the PHQ-9 screening tool for depression, 14.3% (53/371) had contemplated suicide during their staff career in EM, and of those, 5.9% (22/371) had actively considered suicide in the past year. Canadian EM physicians just before the COVID-19 pandemic had an alarming number of respondents meet the threshold for burnout, confirming EM as a high-risk specialty. This important baseline information can be used to monitor the physical and mental risks to EM physicians during and after COVID-19, and evaluate support for mental health and wellness, which is urgently needed now and post pandemic.","Lim, Aarsen, Gray, Rang, Fitzpatrick, Fischer","https://doi.org/10.1017/cem.2020.431","20200722","COVID-19; Emergency medicine; physician wellness","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

An online survey was applied which collected information on demographic and financial status data, physical status, contact history, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures concerning COVID-19. Impact of Event Scale-Revised and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale were included. 50.3% of respondents rated psychological distress as moderate-severe; 15.7% reported moderate-severe depressive symptoms; 22.6% reported moderate-severe anxiety symptoms; and 19.8% reported moderate-severe stress levels. Female gender, older age, divorced status, lack confidence related to security of the test, lower satisfaction of health information concerning COVID-19, history of direct or indirect contact with a COVID-19 confirmed case, live with just one other person and spent &gt;9h per day at home were associated with greater psychological distress and/or higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. By contrast, precautionary measures as hand hygiene and wearing masks were associated with lower levels of psychological distress, depression, anxiety, and stress.

"Do Paramedics Have a Professional Obligation to Work During a Pandemic? A Qualitative Exploration of Community Member Expectations","Previous research has identified a lack of clarification regarding paramedic professional obligation to work. Understanding community expectations of paramedics will provide some clarity around this issue. The objective of this research was to explore the expectations of a sample of Australian community members regarding the professional obligation of paramedics to respond during pandemics. The authors used qualitative methods to gather Australian community member perspectives immediately before the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Focus groups were used for data collection, and a thematic analysis was conducted. The findings revealed 9 key themes: context of obligation (normal operations versus crisis situation), hierarchy of obligation (individual versus organizational obligation), risk acceptability, acceptable occupational risk (it's part of the job), access to personal protective equipment, legal and ethical guidelines, education and training, safety, and acceptable limitations to obligation. The factors identified as being acceptable limitations to professional obligation are presented as further sub-themes: physical health, mental health, and competing personal obligations. The issue of professional obligation must be addressed by ambulance services as a matter of urgency, especially in light of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic. Further research is recommended to understand how community member expectations evolve during and after the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic.","Anderson, Pooley, Mills, Anderson, Smith","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.212","20200717","disaster medicine; emergency medical services; mass casualty incidents; public health surveillance; triage","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Care of newborns born to mothers with COVID-19 infection; a review of existing evidence","<b>Background:</b> The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is already wreaking havoc on families and communities' welfare. It is critical to discuss newborn care of infected mothers with COVID-19 based on the latest international guidelines and national guidelines of countries with the highest incidence of COVID-19 cases.<b>Objective:</b> We discuss how to care for a newborn of a suspected or infected mother with COVID-19 using existing evidence.<b>Method:</b> As of 16 April 2020, we reviewed articles and guidelines related to COVID-19 in the reproductive health field, mother, and newborn health. Our review yielded in 10 categories (i) the risk of diagnostic procedures in suspected mothers on fetus/infant health, (ii) the risk of intrauterine or postpartum transmission to the fetus/infant, (iii) appropriate method and delivery time in women with confirmed COVID-19, (iv) umbilical cord clamping and skin to skin contact, (v) clinical manifestations of infected infants, (vi) confirmation of infection in a suspected neonate/infant, (vii) instructions for infant's care and how to feed her/him, (viii) bathing the baby, (ix) the criteria of discharging baby from the hospital, (x) the impact of isolation on the maternal mental health.<b>Results:</b> Our findings showed that the possibility of intrauterine or perinatal transmission of COVID-19 is still questionable and ambiguous. However, what has been agreed upon in the existing texts and guidelines is that the close contact of mother and infant after birth can transmit the virus to the baby through droplets or micro-droplets.<b>Conclusions:</b> Based on our findings, it is recommended to separate the baby from the mother with confirmed (or suspected) COVID-19 infection for at least 2â€‰weeks. Since the motivation and stable situation of mothers allow breastfeeding during the isolation, infected mothers should be taught about breast expression skills, common breast problems, the symptoms of their baby's infection, and the principles of personal hygiene to protect the infant against COVID-19 infection.","Shahbazi Sighaldeh, Ebrahimi Kalan","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1777969","20200624","Breastfeeding; COVID-19; Coronavirus Disease 19; Newborn Care; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Differences in Preventive Behaviors of COVID-19 between Urban and Rural Residents: Lessons Learned from A Cross-Sectional Study in China","<i>Purpose:</i> The purpose of this study is to examine the differences in preventive behaviors of COVID-19 between urban and rural residents, as well as identify the factors that might contribute to such differences. <i>Methods:</i> Our online survey included 1591 participants from 31 provinces of China with 87% urban and 13% rural residents. We performed multiple linear regressions and path analysis to examine the relationship between rural status and behavioral intention, attitude, subjective norms, information appraisal, knowledge, variety of information source use, and preventive behaviors against COVID-19. <i>Findings:</i> Compared with urban residents, rural residents were less likely to perform preventive behaviors, more likely to hold a negative attitude toward the effectiveness of performing preventive behaviors, and more likely to have lower levels of information appraisal skills. We identified information appraisal as a significant factor that might contribute to the rural/urban differences in preventive behaviors against COVID-19 through attitude, subjective norms, and intention. We found no rural/urban differences in behavioral intention, subjective norms, knowledge about preventive behaviors, or the variety of interpersonal/media source use. <i>Conclusions:</i> As the first wave of the pandemic inundated urban areas, the current media coverage about COVID-19 prevention may not fully satisfy the specific needs of rural populations. Thus, rural residents were less likely to engage in a thoughtful process of information appraisal and adopt the appropriate preventive measures. Tailoring health messages to meet rural populations' unique needs can be an effective strategy to promote preventive health behaviors against COVID-19.","Chen, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124437","20200702","COVID-19; critical heath literacy; information appraisal; rural-urban health disparities; structural equation modeling; theory of reasoned action; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Intention; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rural Population; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Effect of COVID-19 on liver transplantation in Korea","COVID-19 is now a pandemic with increasing numbers of cases and deaths. In addition to the economic and social damage caused by COVID-19 outbreak prolongation, damage caused by delayed treatment of other diseases such as severe cirrhosis is also serious. We aimed to describe the effect of COVID-19 on the number of liver transplants (LT) in South Korea. The number of LT performed in Korea during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak, and the COVID-19 pandemic was compared with the average number of LT performed in the past 5Â years. There were 108.5 cases of LT performed per month during the MERS outbreak. It was 11% lower than the average of 122.8 cases per month for the last 5Â years. LDLT and DDLT decreased by 13% to 75.3 cases and by 7.5% to 33.2 cases per month during the MERS epidemic, respectively. From January to March 2020 (COVID-19 outbreak), the number of LT did not decrease significantly. The lockdown caused by COVID-19 did not affect the number of liver transplants in Korea. Establishing a safe process and procedure of liver transplantation within safe boundaries can be beneficial in reducing the side effects of lockdown and saving patients' lives.","Lee","https://doi.org/10.1111/tid.13384","20200717",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Beliefs towards the COVID-19 pandemic among patients with emotional disorders in China","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has given rise to fear and panic in the public. Although hospitals in China reduced outpatient visits and restricted inpatient admission to lower the risk of transmission of COVID-19, this has significantly affected patients in need of medical attention, for example, patients with emotional disorders. This study aimed to compare the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders (ie, anxiety or depression) with those of family caregivers and the general public and examine factors that shape the beliefs towards COVID-19 among outpatients with emotional disorders. Survey data from 570 outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders, 449 family caregivers and 470 general public subjects were collected. Multiple stepwise regression analyses were used to describe participants' level of concern, prevention attitude and positive expectations towards the COVID-19 outbreak. About 70.9% of outpatients had to postpone their mental health treatment; 43.2% of patients admitted that their mental health was adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak-these patients tended to be older, male and less educated. After controlling for age and education level, outpatients with emotional disorders had significantly lower levels of concerns but more negative expectations towards COVID-19, compared with family caregivers and the public. Multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis showed that age, education and the perception of the impact of COVID-19 on one's existing mental illness were significantly associated with outpatients' beliefs about the epidemic. Outpatients with anxiety or depression disorders were relatively less focused on the COVID-19 outbreak, but the impact of the infection was found to be independently associated with their beliefs towards COVID-19. In addition, outpatients who were older and of low educational levels particularly held more negative beliefs about the epidemic, which may place them at a higher risk for poor mental health.","Gao, Sun, Jiang, Fang, Yue, Lin, Li","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100231","20200623","anxiety; cross-sectional studies; depression; mental health; psychology, clinical","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Knowledge, Attitudes, Impact, and Anxiety Regarding COVID-19 Infection Among the Public in China","<b>Objectives:</b> Sufficient knowledge and positive attitudes are crucial to the prevention of COVID-19. However, little is known about public awareness and attitudes regarding COVID-19 in China. The impact of COVID-19 on the societal well-being and anxiety levels of the public has never been documented. The aim of this study was to survey the knowledge, attitudes, impact, and anxiety levels of the people of China in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. <b>Method:</b> A cross-sectional population survey using an online questionnaire was undertaken between Jan 24 and Feb 24, 2020. The study participants were residents of mainland China over the age of 18 years. The attitude items in this study measured the perceived threat of COVID-19 based on the Health Belief Model. Anxiety was measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a self-reported questionnaire that measure both state (STAI-S), and trait anxiety (STAI-T) <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,446 completed responses were received. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total knowledge score was 20.3 (<i>SD</i> Â± 2.9) out of a possible score of 23. The social disruption and household economic impact were notable, particularly in provinces with higher cumulative confirmed cases. The majority of responses indicated a low perceived susceptibility of being infected (86.7% [95%CI 85.4-88.1]), with a fair proportion of respondents perceiving a higher severity (62.9% [95% CI 61.0-64.8]). The mean total impact score was 9.9 (<i>SD</i> Â± 3.8) out of a possible score of 15. The mean score for STAI-S was 48.7 (<i>SD</i> Â± 10.8), whereas the mean STAI-T score was 45.7 (<i>SD</i> Â± 8.5). By demographics, women reported significantly higher odds for higher levels of both STAI-S (<i>OR</i> = 1.67) and STAI-T (<i>OR</i> = 1.30) compared to men. People of a younger age were also more likely to experience higher STAI-S and STAI-T. Higher perceived susceptibility and severity and impact were strong predictors of higher levels of STAI-S and STAI-T. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings can assist in tailoring public communication to change people's knowledge and attitudes. The present study also underlined the importance of the promotion of mental health during infectious disease outbreaks to help in moderating the perceived threat, social and household economic impact, targeting the vulnerable segment of the population.","Lin, Hu, Alias, Wong","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00236","20200623","COVID-19; anxiety; attitude; impact; knowledge","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psycho-Neuroendocrine-Immune Interactions in COVID-19: Potential Impacts on Mental Health","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The impacts of the disease may be beyond the respiratory system, also affecting mental health. Several factors may be involved in the association between COVID-19 and psychiatric outcomes, such as fear inherent in the pandemic, adverse effects of treatments, as well as financial stress, and social isolation. Herein we discuss the growing evidence suggesting that the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and host may also trigger changes in brain and behavior. Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it is conceivable that changes in endocrine and immune response in the periphery or in the central nervous system may be involved in the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and impaired mental health. This is likely to be further enhanced, since millions of people worldwide are isolated in quarantine to minimize the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and social isolation can also lead to neuroendocrine-immune changes. Accordingly, we highlight here the hypothesis that neuroendocrine-immune interactions may be involved in negative impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation on psychiatric issues.","Raony, de Figueiredo, Pandolfo, Giestal-de-Araujo, Oliveira-Silva Bomfim, Savino","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01170","20200710","COVID-19; HPA axis; SARS-CoV-2; central nervous system; cytokine; mental health; pandemic; social isolation; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Endocrine System Diseases; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Nervous System Diseases; Neurosecretory Systems; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Online Mental Health Survey in a Medical College in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, has led to the quarantine of many residents in their homes, in order to mitigate its spread. Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province. The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study. A total of 217 students participated in the survey. Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male. Furthermore, 77 students (35.5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22.1%) were in a state of anxiety. The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states. There were no significant differences in students in terms of gender, geographical location, and grade, for the prevalence of depression and anxiety.

"Can nanotechnology help in the fight against COVID-19?","The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus demands the development of strategies not only to detect or inactivate the virus, but to treat it (therapeutically and prophylactically). COVID-19 is not only a critical threat for the population with risk factors, but also generates a dramatic economic impact in terms of morbidity and the overall interruption of economic activities. Advanced materials are the basis of several technologies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19: biosensors might allow early virus detection, nanosized vaccines are powerful agents that could prevent viral infections, and nanosystems with antiviral activity could bind the virus for inactivation or destruction upon application of an external stimulus. Herein all these methods are discussed under the light of cutting-edge technologies and the previously reported prototypes targeting enveloped viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2. This analysis was derived from an extensive scientific literature search (including pubmed) performed on April 2020.

We conducted a literature search on pandemic or outbreak management in forensic mental health settings, including gray literature sources, from 2000 to April 2020. We describe the evolution of a COVID-19 outbreak in our own facility, and the design, and staffing of a forensic isolation unit. We found a range of useful guidance but no published experience of implementing these approaches. We experienced outbreaks of COVID-19 on two secure forensic units with 13 patients and 10 staff becoming positive. One patient died. The outbreaks lasted for 41 days on each unit from declaration to resolution. We describe the approaches taken to reduction of infection risk, social distancing and changes to the care delivery model. Forensic secure settings present major challenges as some proposals for pandemic management such as decarceration or early release are not possible, and facilities may present challenges to achieve sustained social distancing. Assertive testing, cohorting, and isolation units are appropriate responses to these challenges.","Simpson, Chatterjee, Darby, Jones, Maheandiran, Penney, Saccoccio, Stergiopoulos, Wilkie","https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743720935648","20200625","COVID-19; forensic mental health; isolation units; secure hospital","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

A web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in a cross-sectional design in three groups of participants: (1.) patients with RD, (2.) hospital workers, and (3.) high-school teachers/academic staff. Psychiatric status was evaluated using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised scale. Overall response rate was 34.7%. We studied 771 patients with RD, 535 hospital workers, and 917 teachers/academic staff. Most of the patients with RD were unwilling to go to the hospital (86%), while 22% discontinued their medications. Biological DMARDS were the most frequent drugs whose doses were altered. Only 4% were willing to take hydroxychloroquine for protection. Moreover, the frequency of anxiety (20%), depression (43%), and post-traumatic stress (28%) among patients with RD were found to be comparable to that found among the teachers/academic staff (23%, 43% and 29%, respectively), whereas significantly less than that observed among the hospital workers (40%, 62%, and 46%, respectively) (pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.001). Female gender, use of social media, having a comorbid disease, or a psychiatric disorder were found to be independently associated with psychiatric symptoms in total study population. The majority of the patients were unwilling to attend outpatient visits and one-fifth skipped or stopped their immunosuppressive agents. Psychiatric symptoms in patient's and teacher's populations were of considerable clinical concern, despite being significantly lower than that observed among the hospital workers.","Seyahi, Poyraz, Sut, Akdogan, Hamuryudan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00296-020-04626-0","20200714","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Health workers; Mental health; Outbreak; Post-traumatic stress; Rheumatic diseases; Rheumatology; Sleep disorders; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rheumatic Diseases; Turkey; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

An anonymous 22 question survey regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educational and clinical missions of residencies, its perceived impact upon morale of radiologists and trainees and a query of innovative solutions devised in response, was emailed to the Association of Program Directors in Radiology membership. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California). Respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their residency programs. Regarding the educational mission impact, 70.1% (75/107) report moderate/marked negative impact and 2.8% (3/107) that educational activities have ceased. Regarding the pandemic's impact on resident morale, 44.8% (48/107) perceive moderate/marked negative effect; perceived resident morale in programs with redeployment is significantly worse with 57.1% (12/21) reporting moderate/marked decrease. Respondents overwhelmingly report adequate resident access to mental health resources during the acute phase of the pandemic (88.8%, 95/107). Regarding morale of program directors, 61% (65/106) report either mild or marked decreased morale. Program innovations reported by program directors were catalogued and shared. The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly impacted the perceived well-being and educational missions of radiology residency programs across the United States.","Robbins, England, Patel, DeBenedectis, Sarkany, Heitkamp, Milburn, Kalia, Ali, Gaviola, Ho, Jay, Ong, Jordan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2020.06.002","20200721","Association of Program Directors in Radiology; COVID-19; Program director; Radiology resident; Well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"&quot;Quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak: Changes in diet and physical activity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease&quot;","CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home. Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.","Mattioli, Sciomer, Cocchi, Maffei, Gallina","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020","20200625","COVID-19; Gender; Lifestyle; Physical activity; Quarantine; Stress; Vitamin D","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Emotional distress in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence of risk and resilience from a longitudinal cohort study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated lockdown could be considered a 'perfect storm' for increases in emotional distress. Such increases can only be identified by studies that use data collected before and during the pandemic. Longitudinal data are also needed to examine (1) the roles of previous distress and stressors in emotional distress during the pandemic and (2) how COVID-19-related stressors and coping strategies are associated with emotional distress when pre-pandemic distress is accounted for. Data came from a cohort study (N = 768). Emotional distress (perceived stress, internalizing symptoms, and anger), COVID-19-related stressors, and coping strategies were measured during the pandemic/lockdown when participants were aged 22. Previous distress and stressors were measured before COVID-19 (at age 20). On average, participants showed increased levels of perceived stress and anger (but not internalizing symptoms) during the pandemic compared to before. Pre-COVID-19 emotional distress was the strongest predictor of during-pandemic emotional distress, followed by during-pandemic economic and psychosocial stressors (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions) and hopelessness, and pre-pandemic social stressors (e.g. bullying victimization and stressful life events). Most health risks to self or loved ones due to COVID-19 were not uniquely associated with emotional distress in final models. Coping strategies associated with reduced distress included keeping a daily routine, physical activity, and positive reappraisal/reframing. In our community sample, pre-pandemic distress, secondary consequences of the pandemic (e.g. lifestyle and economic disruptions), and pre-pandemic social stressors were more consistently associated with young adults' emotional distress than COVID-19-related health risk exposures.","Shanahan, Steinhoff, Bechtiger, Murray, Nivette, Hepp, Ribeaud, Eisner","https://doi.org/10.1017/S003329172000241X","20200709","COVID-19; distress; mental health; resilience; stress; young adults","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"How Much Support Is There for the Recommendations Made to the General Population during Confinement? A Study during the First Three Days of the COVID-19 Quarantine in Spain","<i>Background:</i> Recommendations on lifestyles during quarantine have been proposed by researchers and institutions since the COVID-19 crisis emerged. However, most of these have never been tested under real quarantine situations or derive from older investigations conducted mostly in China and Canada in the face of infections other than COVID-19. The present study aimed at exploring the relationship between a comprehensive set of recommended lifestyles, socio-demographic, and personality variables and mood during the first stages of quarantine. <i>Methods</i>: A virtual snow-ball recollection technique was used to disseminate the survey across the general population in Spain starting the first day of mandatory quarantine (15 March 2020) until three days later (17 March). In total, 2683 Spanish adults (mean age = 34.86 years, <i>SD</i> = 13.74 years; 77.7% women) from the general population completed measures on socio-demographic, COVID-related, behavioral, personality/cognitive, and mood characteristics. <i>Results</i>: In the present study, depression and anger were higher than levels reported in a previous investigation before the COVID-19 crisis, while vigor, friendliness, and fatigue were lower. Anxiety levels were comparable. The expected direction of associations was confirmed for the majority of predictors. However, effect sizes were generally small and only a subset of them correlated to most outcomes. Intolerance of unpleasant emotions, neuroticism, and, to a lesser extent, agreeableness, sleep quality, young age, and time spent Internet surfing were the most robust and strongest correlates of mood states. <i>Conclusions</i>: Some recommended lifestyles (i.e., maintaining good quality of sleep and reducing Internet surfing) might be more important than others during the first days of quarantine. Promoting tolerance to unpleasant emotions (e.g., through online, self-managed programs) might also be of upmost importance. So far, recommendations have been made in general, but certain subgroups (e.g., certain personality profiles and young adults) might be especially vulnerable and should receive more attention.","Suso-Ribera, MartÃ­n-Brufau","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124382","20200723","COVIDâ€“19; frustration intolerance; lifestyle; mood states; quarantine; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Resilience, Psychological; Social Support; Spain; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In this general review, we examined the literature about the psychological effects of COVID-19 pandemia. In total 65 papers were reviewed using the Medline computer database. Only publications in English were selected. Children are likely to be experiencing worry, anxiety and fear and older people are also those with underlying health conditions, having been identified as more vulnerable to COVID-19, can be extremely frightening and very fear-inducing. China and several other countries took strict isolation measures. Medical staff and affiliated healthcare workers (staff) are under both physical and psychological pressure. The COVID-19 pandemic is exceptional. Its effect will likely be imprinted on each individual involved. Extensive stressors will emerge or become worsened.

"Coinfection with HIV and SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China: A 12-person case series","Given the magnitude of the global COVID-19 pandemic, persons living with HIV (PLWH) may become co-infected with SARS-COV-2. We conducted a survey in Wuhan, China, to characterize the status of co-infected PLWH, their time to clinical improvement, and clinical prognoses. Using a Wuhan shipping service for antiretroviral medications, the Wuhan LGBT Center screened 2900 PLWH shipping addresses and cross-referenced 36 of them to quarantine sites or hospitals, suggesting possible COVID-19 cases. Via telephone calls and WeChat (social media) messaging, we conducted a survey after obtaining online informed consent. We had 12 HIV-infected respondents (10 men, 2 women) who also reported COVID-19. Median age was 36 years (inter-quartile range: 33.0-56.3), mean age 42.4, and range 25-66 years of age. Nine of 10 persons on antiretroviral therapy (ART) presented with only mild COVID-19 symptoms. The tenth person on ART was a 56-year old man who died at home early in the outbreak when healthcare services were overwhelmed. Two additional cases who had been in intensive care with acute COVID-19 were both men, ages 25 and 37; both were ART-naÃ¯ve until this hospitalization. Excluding the deceased man, 6 of 11 co-infected persons reported feeling depressed even after clinical improvements. Twelve co-infected persons were identified in Wuhan; nine of 10 were on long-term ART and had favorable outcomes. Two men identified as having started ART only recently were found to have severe symptoms.

"The Effects of Confinement on Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease During the COVID-19 Crisis","Neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, agitation, and hallucinations, are frequent in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and their prevalence tends to increase with external stressors. We offer the first investigation of the effects of confinement during the COVID-19 crisis on neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD. We contacted caregivers of 38 patients with AD who were confined to their homes for nearly two months and asked them to report whether patients experienced any change in neuropsychiatric symptoms during, compared to before, the confinement and rate its severity and impact on themselves using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. Among the 38 patients, only 10 demonstrated neuropsychiatric changes during the confinement. Cognitive function of these 10 patients, assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination, was worse than that of patients who did not demonstrate neuropsychiatric changes. Interestingly, among the 10 patients with neuropsychiatric changes, the duration of confinement significantly correlated with the severity of symptoms as well as with their caregivers' distress. The confinement seems to impact neuropsychiatric symptomatology in AD patients with low baseline cognitive function.","Boutoleau-BretonniÃ¨re, Pouclet-Courtemanche, Gillet, Bernard, Deruet, Gouraud, Mazoue, Lamy, Rocher, Kapogiannis, El Haj","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200604","20200715","Alzheimerâ€™s disease; COVID-19; confinement; neuropsychiatric symptoms; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Betacoronavirus; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Status and Dementia Tests; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We explored the emotional state, perception, and concerns of Saudi patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) during the crisis. We conducted a cross-sectional survey from 30 March to 5 April, 2020 using a pre-designed questionnaire distributed through social media platforms to IBD patients. The five-part questionnaire included an assessment of psychological wellbeing using a previously validated Arabic version of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which includes domains for anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D). A logistic regression analysis was used to uncover possible associations between patient characteristics and anxiety and depression. The data from 1156 IBD patients were analyzed. Normal, borderline, and HADS-A scores consistent with a diagnosis of anxiety were reported by 423 (36.6%), 174 (15.1%), and 559 (48.4%) patients, respectively. However, 635 (69%) patients had normal scores and 273 (30.1%) had borderline HADS-D scores; no patients reported scores consistent with depression.

The objective of this article was to find the prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and stress and their socio-demographic correlates among Indian population during the lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an electronic questionnaire. A total of 354 participants were recruited through convenience sampling. Depression, anxiety and stress were measured using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), a 21-item self-reported questionnaire. In total, 25%, 28% and 11.6% of the participants were moderate to extremely severely depressed, anxious and stressed, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated employment status (odds ratio (OR)â€‰=â€‰1.91; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.072-3.418) and binge drinking (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.03; 95% CI: 1.045-3.945) were significantly associated with depressive symptoms; gender (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.17; 95% CI: 1.317-3.589), employment status (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.77; 95% CI: 1.002-3.141) and binge drinking (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.62; 95% CI: 1.361-5.048) were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms; and binge drinking (ORâ€‰=â€‰3.42; 95% CI: 1.544-7.583) was significantly associated with stress symptoms. Depression, anxiety and stress among Indian population during the lockdown were prevalent.

Europe continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of writing France was the fourth country with the highest number of detected cases and cumulative deaths. Websites of the World Health Organization, French Government, French Agency of Public Health, French National Council of Nurses and ClinicalTrials.gov database, as well as the experiences of the authors. The history of the development of the pandemic in France helps explain the establishment of the state of health emergency and containment of the population. Many decisions made had undesirable repercussions, particularly in terms of intra-family violence, mental health disorders and the renunciation of care. Hospitals and primary care services, with significant investment by nurses, played a key role in the care of persons with and without COVID-19. France has suffered a very high toll in terms of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, and effects on its people, health systems and health professionals, including nurses. Nurses are recognized for their social usefulness in France. However, it is important to consider the collateral effects of this crisis on nurses and nursing and to integrate the health emergency nursing skills established during the pandemic into the standard field of nursing competence. The nursing profession has expectations of a reflection on and revision of nursing skills as well as of its valorization in the French healthcare system, notably carried out by the French National Council Order of Nurses.","Chamboredon, Roman, Colson","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12604","20200717","COVID-19; France; Health Emergency; Health Policy; Nursing Nursing Policy; Pandemics Primary Care Nursing; Public Health; Roles and Responsibilities","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Changing dynamics of psychoneuroimmunology during the COVID-19 pandemic","The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a global health care crisis. Emerging research suggest an unanticipated impact of COVID-19 on mental and/or psychological health of both the general community and affected individuals. The fear of the COVID-19 epidemic and the consequent lockdown and economic crisis has led to globally increased psychological distress. The biological bases of immediate and new onset of psychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 are not yet known. COVID-19 infection may lead to activated immune-inflammatory pathways and a cytokine storm. Activated immune-inflammatory pathways, especially chronic low-grade inflammation, are associated with major psychiatric disorders in at least a subset of individuals. We propose that both the (sub)chronic inflammatory response and cytokine storm might crucially be involved in the immediate manifestation of neuropsychiatric symptoms in individuals with COVID-19 infection as well as heightened expression of psychiatric symptoms in COVID-19 infected individuals with prior psychiatric conditions. These events might expand concepts in psychoneuroimmunology, with the importance of chronic-low grade inflammation augmented by the cytokine storm hypothesis. Additionally, this might augment and refine diagnosis and prognostic management as well as treatment.","Debnath, Berk, Maes","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100096","20200710","COVID-19; Chronic low-grade inflammation; Cytokine storm; Delirium; Depression; Mental health; Neuroscience; Psychiatry; Psychosis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We systematically searched the literature on health education during COVID-19, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemics in Medline (via PubMed), Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China Biology Medicine disc (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data from their inception until March 31, 2020. The potential bias of the studies was assessed by Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Tool. Of 1,067 papers found, 24 cross-sectional studies with a total of 35,967 participants were included in this review. The general public lacked good knowledge of SARS and MERS at the early stage of epidemics. Some people's knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of COVID-19 had been improved, but the health behaviors of some special groups including children and their parents need to be strengthened. Negative emotions including fear and stigmatization occurred during the outbreaks. Reliable health information was needed to improve public awareness and mental health for infectious diseases. Health information from nonprofit, government and academic websites was more accurate than privately owned commercial websites and media websites. For educating and cultivating children, parents should obtain information from the official websites of authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and national Centers for Disease Control, or from other sources endorsed by these authorities, rather than from a general search of the internet or social media.","Li, Liao, Li, Baskota, Wang, Tang, Zhou, Wang, Luo, Ma, Fukuoka, Ahn, Lee, Chen, Luo, Liu","https://doi.org/10.21037/atm-20-3312","20200623","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); children; health education; parents; rapid review","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Flattening the curve of mental ill-health: the importance of primary prevention in managing the mental health impacts of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is one the biggest challenges the global community has faced this century. The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a 'wave' of COVID-19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; unemployment; housing and income stress; intimate partner violence; work-related trauma; and grief and loss. The 'two-pronged' approach used to deal with COVID-19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new-onset cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to 'flatten the curve' and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among others.","Carbone","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mhp.2020.200185","20200715","COVID-19; Mental disorders; Mental health; Pandemic; Primary prevention; Risk factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Increased stressful impact among general population in mainland China amid the COVID-19 pandemic: A nationwide cross-sectional study conducted after Wuhan city's travel ban was lifted","Our study aimed to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological responses and lifestyle changes among the general population in mainland China following the re-opening of the Wuhan city. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in April 2020. Participants of Chinese nationality agedâ€‰â©¾â€‰18â€‰years were asked to complete a modified validated Chinese version of a questionnaire regarding the impact of event scale (IES), family and social support, mental health-related lifestyle changes, and indicators of negative mental health impacts. A total of 728 participants (i.e., 217 males and 511 females) completed the questionnaire. The mean age of the participants was 32.9â€‰Â±â€‰10.4â€‰years, with a majority of them (92.2%) having a higher educational qualification level. The overall mean IES in participants was 21.5â€‰Â±â€‰7.0, reflecting mild stressful impact (i.e., following the re-opening of the Wuhan city); 25.5% of the participants had an IES scoreâ€‰â©¾â€‰26. Being females and married were significantly associated with a higher mean IES score. The overall mean scores for intrusion and avoidance score scales in participants were 9.4â€‰Â±â€‰3.7 and 12.1â€‰Â±â€‰4.2, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased stressful impact in our participants following the re-opening of the Wuhan city when compared with our previous study, which should not be taken lightly.","Ma, Zhang, Luo, Li, Li, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020935489","20200622","COVID-19; China; Coronavirus; lifestyle changes; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of Personal Protective Equipment on Surgical Performance During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 pandemic has exposed surgeons to hazardous working conditions, imposing the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) use during surgery. The use of such equipment may affect their non-technical skills, augment fatigue, and affect performance. This study aimed to assess the surgeons' perceptions of the impact of wearing PPE during emergency surgery throughout the pandemic. An international cooperation group conducted an anonymous online survey among surgeons from over 30 countries, to assess perceptions about the impact of PPE use on non-technical skills, overall comfort, decision making, and surgical performance during emergency surgery on COVID-19 patients. Responses to the survey (134) were received from surgeons based on 26 countries. The vast majority (72%) were males. More than half of the respondents (54%) felt that their surgical performance was hampered with PPE. Visual impairment was reported by 63%, whereas 54% had communication impediments. Less than half (48%) felt protected with the use of PPE, and the same proportion perceived that the use of such equipment influenced their decision making. Decreased overall comfort was cited by 66%, and 82% experienced increased surgical fatigue. Surgeons perceived impediment for both visibility and communication, and other non-technical skills while using PPE on emergency surgery in COVID-19 patients. Their perceived lack of protection and comfort and increased fatigue may have inhibited their optimal surgical performance. More attention should be placed in the design of more user-friendly equipment, given the possibility of a second wave of the pandemic.","YÃ¡nez BenÃ­tez, GÃ¼emes, Aranda, Ribeiro, Ottolino, Di Saverio, Alexandrino, Ponchietti, Blas, Ramos, Rangelova, MuÃ±oz, YÃ¡nez","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-020-05648-2","20200624",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Insomnia during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown: Prevalence, severity, and associated risk factors in French population","In response to Voitsidis etÂ al. (2020) published in Psychiatry Research addressing the paucity of research on insomnia during a pandemic, we obtained data from an online cross-sectional survey by documenting the prevalence of clinical insomnia and its contributing factors in a French general public sample. Participants (NÂ =Â 556) completed the Insomnia Severity Index, UCLA Loneliness scale, and provided information on sociodemographics, antecedents of mental and physical health conditions, and COVID-19-related stressful life events. In our sample, 19.1% met the diagnostic criteria of clinical insomnia, which was twice lower than that reported in the study by Voitsidis etÂ al., but close to those found among Chinese and Italian populations. We confirmed COVID-19-related worries and loneliness to be the major contributing factors to clinical insomnia, in addition to education status, being infected by the virus and pre-existing mental health illness. These findings underscore that sleep-related problems should be an important component of mental health interventions during pandemics.","Kokou-Kpolou, Megalakaki, Laimou, Kousouri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113128","20200714",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychological and mental impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical staff and general public - A systematic review and meta-analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures. In conclusion, psychological interventions targeting high-risk populations with heavy psychological distress are in urgent need.","Luo, Guo, Yu, Jiang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113190","20200707","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Psychological impact; Psychological intervention; Review; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece Comparison between 2019 and 2020","In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70-79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.","Sakelliadis, Katsos, Zouzia, Spiliopoulou, Tsiodras","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365","20200720","COVID-19; Forensic medicine; Greece; Lockdown; Mortality; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Correlates of symptoms of anxiety and depression and mental wellbeing associated with COVID-19: a cross-sectional study of UK-based respondents","The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population. A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and â‰¥75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (&lt;Â£15,000: reference; Â£25,000-&lt;Â£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; Â£40,000-&lt;Â£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and â‰¥Â£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46).

Despite these challenges, many of the changes implemented during the pandemic can and should be maintained. These include offering a spectrum of options for remote and in-person care, greater integration of behavioral and physical healthcare, prevention of viral exposure, increased collaborativeÂ decision-making related to long-acting injectable and clozapine use, modifying safety plans and psychiatric advance directives to include new technologies and broader support systems, leveraging natural supports, and integration of digital health interventions.

The influence of the baseline characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory parameters and the types of mental disorders on prognosis were analyzed. According to their final prognosis, the patients were divided into the deceased group (5 patients) and the cured group (25 patients). The mortality rate of patients with dementia was significantly higher than that of patients with other mental disorders (P = 0.001). The levels of certain laboratory parameters in the serum of dementia patients were significantly increased compared with levels in nondementia patients (WBC count: 10.100Â±6.147 vs. 5.694Â±3.383, p = 0.029; neutrophil count: 8.504Â± 5.993 vs. 3.764 Â± 2.733, P = 0.008; BUN: 8.300Â± 4.072 vs. 4.364 Â± 1.196, P = 0.001).

"COVID-19-Related Loneliness and Psychiatric Symptoms Among Older Adults: The Buffering Role of Subjective Age","The study examined whether subjective age moderated the relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms. A convenience sample of older adult Israelis (Nâ€¯=â€¯277, mean ageâ€¯=â€¯69.58 Â± 6.72) completed web-based questionnaires comprising loneliness, anxiety, depressive, and peritraumatic distress symptoms. They also reported how old they felt. The positive relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms was weak among those who felt younger than their age while this very same relationship was robust among those feeling older. Young subjective age may weaken the loneliness-symptom association among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults holding an older age identity are more susceptible to the adverse effects of loneliness. Although preliminary, the findings may inform screening and interventions. Subjective age may help identify those at high risk in suffering from loneliness, and suggest interventions aimed at ameliorating both loneliness and older subjective ages.","Shrira, Hoffman, Bodner, Palgi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.018","20200623","COVID-19; Loneliness; Psychiatric symptoms; Subjective age","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID-19","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, China. It typically presents with mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and may have life threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, shock, and even death. Coronavirus infections are known to have neuroinvasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients in the TriNetX database, which is a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data from a network of health care organizations (HCOs) from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headache (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%), Encephalopathy (2.3%), Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%) and 0.6% had seizures. Most common psychiatric manifestations included anxiety and other related disorders (4.6%), mood disorders (3.8%), while 0.2% patients had suicidal ideation.

"Psychosocial factors and hospitalisations for COVID-19: Prospective cohort study based on a community sample","While certain infectious diseases have been linked to socioeconomic disadvantage, mental health problems, and lower cognitive function, relationships with COVID-19 are either uncertain or untested. Our objective was to examine the association of a range of psychosocial factors with hospitalisation for COVID-19. UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study, comprises around half a million people who were aged 40 to 69 years at study induction between 2006 and 2010 when information on psychosocial factors and covariates were captured. Hospitalisation for COVID-19 were ascertained between 16<sup>th</sup> March and 26<sup>th</sup> April 2020. There were 908 hospitalisations for COVID-19 in an analytical sample of 431,051 England-based study members. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, an elevated risk of COVID-19 was related to disadvantaged levels of education (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 2.05; 1.70, 2.47), income (2.00; 1.63, 2,47), area deprivation (2.20; 1.86, 2.59), occupation (1.39; 1.14, 1.69), psychological distress (1.58; 1.32, 1.89), mental health (1.50; 1.25, 1.79), neuroticism (1.19; 1.00, 1.42), and performance on two tests of cognitive function - verbal and numerical reasoning (2.66; 2.06, 3.34) and reaction speed (1.27; 1.08, 1.51). These associations were graded (p-value for trend â‰¤0.038) such that effects were apparent across the full psychosocial continua. After mutual adjustment for these characteristics plus ethnicity, comorbidity, and lifestyle factors, only the relationship between lower cognitive function as measured using the reasoning test and a doubling in the risk of the infection remained (1.98; 1.38, 2.85). A range of psychosocial factors revealed associations with hospitalisations for COVID-19 of which the relation with cognitive function, a marker of health literacy, was most robust.","Batty, Deary, Luciano, Altschul, KivimÃ¤ki, Gale","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.021","20200627","COVID-19; UK Biobank; cohort study; hospitalisation; risk factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord.

While many psychiatrists have different views on this question, recent developments suggest AI may change the practice of psychiatry for both clinicians and patients.","Allen","https://doi.org/10.1109/MPULS.2020.2993657","20200625","Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mobile Applications; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry; Psychotherapy; Smartphone","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Fighting COVID-19: Fear and Internal Conflict among Older Adults in Ghana","The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has upended the social lives and health of all people globally. The debilitating brunt of the infection and mortality has been huge for older adults with comorbidities. The exponential rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Ghana have engendered intense fear and anxiety among the at-risk populations with serious implications for mental health and well-being of older people. In this letter, I call on the government to implement innovative interventions to contain the spread of COVID-19 to older people. The health system should realign to deliver geriatric care and psychological support for older people in these extraordinary times.","Gyasi","https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2020.1766630","20200619","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Ghana; fear; older people; social distancing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological Functioning of Slovene Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Does Resilience Matter?","As a public health emergency, a pandemic increases susceptibility to unfavourable psychological outcomes. The aim of the present study was to investigate the buffering role of personal resilience in two aspects of psychological functioning, mental health and stress, among Slovene adults at the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak. Within five days after Slovenia declared epidemics, 2722 participants (75% female) completed an on-line survey measuring mental health and perceived stress as outcome variables and demographics, health-related variables, and personal resilience as predictor variables. Hierarchical logistic regression analyses demonstrated that women, younger, and less educated participants had higher odds for less favourable psychological functioning during the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, poorer health indicators and COVID-19 infection concerns predicted diminished psychological functioning. The crucial factor promoting good psychological functioning during the COVID-19 pandemics was resilience, additionally buffering against detrimental effects of demographic and health-related variables on mental health and perceived stress. While previous research suggests that mental health problems increase during pandemics, one way to prevent these problems and bolster psychological functioning is to build individuals' resilience. The interventions should be targeted particularly at younger adults, women, less educated people, and individuals who subjectively perceive their health to be rather poor.","KavÄiÄ, Avsec, Zager Kocjan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09789-4","20200622","COVID-19 pandemic; Health; Mental health; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The study included 63 patients, with hip or knee OA, who had been scheduled for arthroplasty that was postponed because of COVID-19. Patients were evaluated by telephone interviews during the first week after lockdown, in the fourth week, and again at the end of the lockdown. Patients rated their pain level on the basis of a visual analog scale (VAS) and completed WOMAC, SF-12 and Tegner activity scale (TAS) questionnaires. VAS and WOMAC scores increased significantly during lockdown, while physical activity significantly decreased. At the final evaluation, VAS and WOMAC showed a significant negative correlation with TAS. The SF-12 subscale scores showed a significant decrease of the physical component during the lockdown, while the mental component remained largely unchanged. Patients with knee OA showed a faster progress of pain compared to those with hip OA. 50 patients (79%) stated they wished to have arthroplasty as soon as possible.

"Evaluation of health-related quality of life using EQ-5D in China during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since December 2019, an increasing number of cases of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Now, more cases have been reported in 200 other countries and regions. The pandemic disease not only affects physical health who suffered it, but also affects the mental health of the general population. This study aims to know about the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of living using EQ-5D in general population in China. An online-based survey was developed and participants were recruited via social media. The questionnaires included demographic and socioeconomic data, health status, the condition epidemic situation and EQ-5D scale. The relationships of all factors and the scores of EQ-5D were analyzed. Logistic regression model were used to the five health dimensions. The respondents obtained a mean EQ-5D index score of 0.949 and a mean VAS score of 85.52.The most frequently reported problem were pain/discomfort (19.0%) and anxiety/depression (17.6%). Logistic regression models showed that the risk of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression among people with aging, with chronic disease, lower income, epidemic effects, worry about get COVID-19 raised significantly. The article provides important evidence on HRQOL during the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk of pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression in general population in China raised significantly with aging, with chronic disease, lower income, epidemic effects, worried about get COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results from each categorical data can be used for future healthcare measures among general population.","Ping, Zheng, Niu, Guo, Zhang, Yang, Shi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0234850","20200706","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life; Research Design; Risk Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Effectiveness of an 8-Week Web-Based Mindfulness Virtual Community Intervention for University Students on Symptoms of Stress, Anxiety, and Depression: Randomized Controlled Trial","A student mental health crisis is increasingly acknowledged and will only intensify with the COVID-19 crisis. Given accessibility of methods with demonstrated efficacy in reducing depression and anxiety (eg, mindfulness meditation and cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT]) and limitations imposed by geographic obstructions and localized expertise, web-based alternatives have become vehicles for scaled-up delivery of benefits at modest cost. Mindfulness Virtual Community (MVC), a web-based program informed by CBT constructs and featuring online videos, discussion forums, and videoconferencing, was developed to target depression, anxiety, and experiences of excess stress among university students. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of an 8-week web-based mindfulness and CBT program in reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (primary outcomes) and increasing mindfulness (secondary outcome) within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with undergraduate students at a large Canadian university. An RCT was designed to assess undergraduate students (n=160) who were randomly allocated to a web-based guided mindfulness-CBT condition (n=80) or to a waitlist control (WLC) condition (n=80). The 8-week intervention consisted of a web-based platform comprising (1) 12 video-based modules with psychoeducation on students' preidentified life challenges and applied mindfulness practice; (2) anonymous peer-to-peer discussion forums; and (3) anonymous, group-based, professionally guided 20-minute live videoconferences. The outcomes (depression, anxiety, stress, and mindfulness) were measured via an online survey at baseline and at 8 weeks postintervention using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire Short Form (FFMQ-SF). Analyses employed generalized estimation equation methods with AR(1) covariance structures and were adjusted for possible covariates (gender, age, country of birth, ethnicity, English as first language, paid work, unpaid work, relationship status, physical exercise, self-rated health, and access to private mental health counseling). Of the 159 students who provided T1 data, 32 were males and 125 were females with a mean age of 22.55 years. Participants in the MVC (n=79) and WLC (n=80) groups were similar in sociodemographic characteristics at T1 with the exception of gender and weekly hours of unpaid volunteer work. At postintervention follow-up, according to the adjusted comparisons, there were statistically significant between-group reductions in depression scores (Î²=-2.21, P=.01) and anxiety scores (Î²=-4.82, P=.006), and a significant increase in mindfulness scores (Î²=4.84, P=.02) compared with the WLC group. There were no statistically significant differences in perceived stress for MVC (Î²=.64, P=.48) compared with WLC. With the MVC intervention, there were significantly reduced depression and anxiety symptoms but no significant effect on perceived stress. Online mindfulness interventions can be effective in addressing common mental health conditions among postsecondary populations on a large scale, simultaneously reducing the current burden on traditional counseling services.

"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10Â years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction. All patients were discharged home with median duration of pediatric intensive care unit stay of 4.7Â days (IQR, 4-8Â days) and a hospital stay of 7.8Â days (IQR, 6.0-10.1Â days). One patient (3%) died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Critically ill children with coronavirus disease-2019-associated MIS-C have a spectrum of severity broader than described previously but still require careful supportive intensive care. Rapid, complete clinical and myocardial recovery was almost universal.","Kaushik, Aydin, Derespina, Bansal, Kowalsky, Trachtman, Gillen, Perez, Soshnick, Conway, Bercow, Seiden, Pass, Ushay, Ofori-Amanfo, Medar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpeds.2020.06.045","20200718",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Persistent and disturbed thinking about the disease appears to be contributing to this mental health concern. Although the <i>Obsession with COVID-19 Scale</i> (OCS) has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument in the U.S., it has not been examined with in Pakistan. The current study addressed this problem by examining the validity of an Urdu translated version of the OCS using online survey data from 240 university students and teachers in Pakistan. The results showed that the OCS exhibited factorial validity, as well as measurement invariance for gender. However, the OCS also showed limited evidence of construct validity in terms of showing weak positive correlations with the total scale and social dysfunction and self-confidence subscales of the <i>General Heath Questionnaire</i> and no correlation with the depression and anxiety subscale (GHQ-12). These findings suggest that further research is necessary before the Urdu version of the OCS is widely adopted in Pakistan.","Ashraf, Lee, Elizabeth Crunk","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2020.1779436","20200624",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The effect of the 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic on college students in Wuhan","This study explored a multiple mediation model in Wuhan's college students. Positive thinking and resilience were identified as mediators between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) victimization experiences and mental health. The sample included 384 from 4 universities in Wuhan, China. Four structured instruments were applied to the college students, including scale of the 2019-nCoV coronavirus victimization experience, scale of the positive thinking, scale of the resilience, and scale of the mental health. The responses were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Structural equation models were used to construct measurement and structural models. The findings confirmed that the 2019-nCoV victimization experience was a negative predictor of mental health; positive thinking and resilience were strong mediators between 2019-nCoV victimization experience and mental health. The results indicated that a complete model was significant because positive thinking compensated for resilience. Notably, these 2 strong mediators will vastly resist the negative influences of 2019-nCoV victimization experience on mental health in Wuhan's college students until the end of the pandemic.

"Loneliness, isolation, and social support factors in post-COVID-19 mental health","Social support plays a key role in well-being, yet one of the major preventative efforts for reducing the spread of COVID-19 involves social distancing. During times of crisis, social support is emphasized as a coping mechanism. This requires many people to change their typical ways of connectedness and assumes that people have existing healthy relationships or access to technology. The purpose of this article was to explore the potential impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and well-being. Social support is an important consideration for understanding the impact of COVID-19 Psychological First Aid and Skills for Psychological Recovery, which are tools used to inform response methods to help people connect during isolation and are interventions that could be adapted to COVID-specific needs for what may be a prolonged isolation and postisolation. Given the many unknowns of COVID-19, studies are needed to understand the larger behavioral health impact to ensure resources are available, current, and evidence informed. Future studies are also needed to understand how access to technology may help buffer loneliness and isolation and thus improve the social outcomes of the current pandemic.

"Commentary on the coronavirus pandemic: Nigeria","About a week after the confirmation of Nigeria's index case of COVID-19 on February 27, 2020, the Nigerian federal government set up a 12-member Presidential Task Force for the Control of the Coronavirus. The country's borders were closed on March 23, and the lockdown of cities was also implemented. The unanticipated disruption of scholarly or professional advancement for the 94% of university students who are not currently learning may increase the burden of mental illness among these students and predispose them to social vices. Two suicide deaths occurred during the lockdown. Poverty, lack of trust in the government, ignorance, denial and misplaced religious zealotry negatively impact on the behavior of Nigerians. Fear-induced behavioral changes such as consuming lemon, ginger, garlic, local herbs, and other substances for protection have also become rampant. Loss of income due to the lockdown and the accompanying destitution can also be a pathfinder for numerous other sicknesses and deaths. For the benefit of enhanced prevention and control of infection, only government-funded hospitals and a few designated privately owned hospitals have been permitted to provide continued services at this time. The number of shifts in these hospitals were adjusted such that there are fewer health care professionals in the hospital at a given time. This strategy has inhibited treatment and care for certain groups of people who are not COVID-19 patients. Efforts are being made to develop telehealth services, but most rural residents may not benefit from them.

"Systematic Review of Clinical Insights into Novel Coronavirus (CoVID-19) Pandemic: Persisting Challenges in US Rural Population","(1) Introduction. A recent viral outbreak of novel coronavirus (CoVID-19) was declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) due to its global public health concern. There has been an aggressive growth in the number of emerging cases suggesting rapid spread of the virus. Since the first reported case of CoVID-19, there has been vast progress in understanding the dynamics of CoVID-19. However, there is an increasing evidence of epidemiological disparity in disease burden between urban and rural areas, with rural areas having minimal pandemic preparedness and their own healthcare challenges. Therefore, this review aims to provide insight on the pathogenesis and the transmission dynamics of CoVID-19 along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention strategies to mitigate the clinical manifestation of this virus. This review also aims to assess existing challenges of the CoVID-19 pandemic in rural areas based on past pandemic experiences and the effect on rural population. (2) Methods. A literature review was conducted using databases such as PubMed, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, along with information from governmental organizations such as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and World Health Organization (WHO). (3) Results. The causative virus, with its likely zoonotic origin, has demonstrated high pathogenicity in humans through increasing human-to-human transmission leading to extensive mitigation strategies, including patient quarantine and mass &quot;social distancing&quot; measures. Although the clinical manifestation of symptoms is mild in majority of the virus-inflicted population, critical patients may present with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, exacerbated by pre-existing comorbidities, eventually leading to death. While effective coronavirus disease (CoVID-19)-specific vaccines and drugs are under clinical trials, several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been adapted to manage symptoms and curtail the effect of the virus to prevent increasing morbidity and mortality. Several persisting challenges have been noted for mitigating CoVID-19 in rural areas, including the poor healthcare infrastructure, health literacy, pandemic preparedness along with the fact that majority of rural population are frail subjects with pre-existing comorbidities. (4) Discussion. The increasing rate of incidence of CoVID-19 presents its own challenges, burdening healthcare institutions and the global economy, and impacting the physical and mental health of people worldwide. Given the clinical insights into CoVID-19 and the challenges presented in this review for the U.S. rural population, mitigation strategies should be designed accordingly to minimize the morbidity and mortality of this contagion.","Lakhani, Pillai, Zehra, Sharma, Sodhi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124279","20200625","clinical characteristics; coronavirus; pandemic; pharmacotherapies; rural healthcare; Betacoronavirus; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Incidence; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Quarantine; Rural Population; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Preserving Organizational Resilience, Patient Safety, and Staff Retention during COVID-19 Requires a Holistic Consideration of the Psychological Safety of Healthcare Workers","During the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare workers are fighting a lethal virus with acute shortages of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). These unprecedented circumstances have amplified the sources of emotional distress and worker burnout. However, many healthcare organizations (HCOs) in the United States, have opted for a &quot;stoic approach&quot; to healthcare worker support, i.e., no additional support beyond federal and state policy protections for the licensing and liability of healthcare workers. In this scenario, a key public health concern is sustaining an adequate healthcare workforce, both by way of quantity (adequate numbers) and quality (maximizing clinician resilience to provide safe care to large volumes of patients under challenging conditions). Therefore, it is imperative for HCO leaders to recognize that a limited view of worker psychological safety, without due consideration for the broader emotional distress created by the pandemic, could have the effect of restricting organizational resilience and adversely impacting patient safety and staff retention during and beyond the pandemic. This paper uses the organizational resilience framework to discuss the potential impact of a stoic approach to healthcare worker support on patient safety and staff retention in a hospital intensive care unit (ICU) during COVID-19. The discussion in turn, helps to develop recommendations for HCOs to overcome these challenges.","Rangachari, L Woods","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17124267","20200625","COVID-19; hospital intensive care; leadership; mental health; organizational resilience; patient safety; staff retention; worker psychological safety; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Health Workforce; Hospitals; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Organizational Culture; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Personal Protective Equipment; Personnel Turnover; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Response of Practicing Chiropractors during the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Descriptive Report","The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strained all levels of healthcare and it is not known how chiropractic practitioners have responded to this crisis. The purpose of this report is to describe responses by a sample of chiropractors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a qualitative-constructivist design to understand chiropractic practice during the COVID-19 pandemic, as described by the participants. A sample of chiropractic practitioners (doctors of chiropractic, chiropractors) from various international locations were invited to participate. Each described the public health response to COVID-19 in their location and the actions that they took in their chiropractic practices from April 20 through May 4, 2020. A summary report was created from their responses and common themes were identified. Eighteen chiropractic practitioners representing 17 locations and 11 countries participated. A variety of practice environments were represented in this sample, including, solo practice, mobile practice, private hospital, US Veterans Administration health care, worksite health center, and group practice. They reported that they recognized and abided by changing governmental regulations. They observed their patients experience increased stress and mental health concerns resulting from the pandemic. They adopted innovative strategies, such as telehealth, to do outreach, communicate with, and provide care for patients. They abided by national and World Health Organization recommendations and they adopted creative strategies to maintain connectivity with patients through a people-centered, integrated, and collaborative approach. Although the chiropractors in this sample practiced in different cities and countries, their compliance with local regulations, concern for staff and patient safety, and people-centered responses were consistent. This sample covers all 7 World Federation of Chiropractic regions (ie, African, Asian, Eastern Mediterranean, European, Latin American, North American, and Pacific) and provides insights into measures taken by chiropractors during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This information may assist the chiropractic profession as it prepares for different scenarios as new evidence about this disease evolves.","Johnson, Green, Konarski-Hart, Hewitt, Napuli, Foshee, Brown, Kopansky-Giles, Stuber, Lerede, Charlton, Field, Botelho, Da Silva, TÃ¸nner, Yap, Gkolfinopoulos, Quintero, Agaoglu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmpt.2020.05.001","20200619","COVID-19 [Supplementary Concept]; Chiropractic; Health Occupations; Pandemics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"School Nurses on the Front Lines of Healthcare: The Approach to Maintaining Student Health and Wellness During COVID-19 School Closures","In response to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, most states in the United States enacted statewide school closures, ranging in duration from 1 month to the remainder of the academic year. The extended durations of these closures present unique challenges, as many families rely on the school as a source of physical activity, mental health services, psychosocial support, child care, and food security. While the school doors may be closed, the school nurse can still play a vital role in emergency management. This article discusses challenges and proposes solutions to maintaining student health and wellness during extended school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, it is inevitable that until a vaccine for coronavirus is developed and readily available, many schools will continue to see future closures, though likely for shorter periods of time, as they respond to local outbreaks.","Rothstein, Olympia","https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602X20935612","20200703","COVID-19; coronavirus; pandemic; school closures; social distancing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Fear of COVID-19 Scale-Associations of Its Scores with Health Literacy and Health-Related Behaviors among Medical Students","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic causes fear, as its immediate consequences for the public have produced unprecedented challenges for the education and healthcare systems. We aimed to validate the fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S) and examine the association of its scores with health literacy and health-related behaviors among medical students. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 7 to 29 April 2020 on 5423 students at eight universities across Vietnam, including five universities in the North, one university in the Center, two universities in the South. An online survey questionnaire was used to collect data on participants' characteristics, health literacy, fear of COVID-19 using the FCoV-19S, and health-related behaviors. The results showed that seven items of the FCoV-19S strongly loaded on one component, explained 62.15% of the variance, with good item-scale convergent validity and high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.90). Higher health literacy was associated with lower FCoV-19S scores (coefficient, B, -0.06; 95% confidence interval, 95%CI, -0.08, -0.04; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Older age or last academic years, being men, and being able to pay for medication were associated with lower FCoV-19S scores. Students with higher FCoV-19S scores more likely kept smoking (odds ratio, OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.14; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) or drinking alcohol (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.06; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) at an unchanged or higher level during the pandemic, as compared to students with lower FCoV-19S scores. In conclusion, the FCoV-19S is valid and reliable in screening for fear of COVID-19. Health literacy was found to protect medical students from fear. Smoking and drinking appeared to have a negative impact on fear of COVID-19. Strategic public health approaches are required to reduce fear and promote healthy lifestyles during the pandemic.","Nguyen, Do, Pham, Kim, Dam, Nguyen, Nguyen, Nguyen, SÃ¸rensen, Pleasant, Duong","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17114164","20200625","Vietnam; academic year; behaviors; fear of COVID-19; health literacy; lifestyles; medical students; mental health; principal component analysis; psychological health; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fear; Female; Health Behavior; Health Literacy; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Smoking; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Vietnam; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Community Susceptibility and Resiliency to COVID-19 Across the Rural-Urban Continuum in the United States","This study creates a COVID-19 susceptibility scale at the county level, describes its components, and then assesses the health and socioeconomic resiliency of susceptible places across the rural-urban continuum. Factor analysis grouped 11 indicators into 7 distinct susceptibility factors for 3,079 counties in the conterminous United States. Unconditional mean differences are assessed using a multivariate general linear model. Data from 2018 are primarily taken from the US Census Bureau and CDC. About 33% of rural counties are highly susceptible to COVID-19, driven by older and health-compromised populations, and care facilities for the elderly. Major vulnerabilities in rural counties include fewer physicians, lack of mental health services, higher disability, and more uninsured. Poor Internet access limits telemedicine. Lack of social capital and social services may hinder local pandemic recovery. Meat processing facilities drive risk in micropolitan counties. Although metropolitan counties are less susceptible due to healthier and younger populations, about 6% are at risk due to community spread from dense populations. Metropolitan vulnerabilities include minorities at higher health and diabetes risk, language barriers, being a transportation hub that helps spread infection, and acute housing distress. There is an immediate need to know specific types of susceptibilities and vulnerabilities ahead of time to allow local and state health officials to plan and allocate resources accordingly. In rural areas it is essential to shelter-in-place vulnerable populations, whereas in large metropolitan areas general closure orders are needed to stop community spread. Pandemic response plans should address vulnerabilities.","Peters","https://doi.org/10.1111/jrh.12477","20200716","COVID-19; community resiliency; county; rural-urban; susceptibility; Age Factors; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rural Population; Social Capital; Social Work; Socioeconomic Factors; United States; Urban Population","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic due to technological barriers","The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been responsible for the devastation of hundreds of thousands of lives directly and has caused disruptions globally. Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously. Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.","Ojha, Syed","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100330","20200617",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Digital Approaches to Remote Pediatric Health Care Delivery During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Existing Evidence and a Call for Further Research","The global spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak poses a public health threat and has affected people worldwide in various unprecedented ways, both personally and professionally. There is no question that the current global COVID-19 crisis, now more than ever, is underscoring the importance of leveraging digital approaches to optimize pediatric health care delivery in the era of this pandemic. In this perspective piece, we highlight some of the available digital approaches that have been and can continue to be used to streamline remote pediatric patient care in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to telemedicine. JMIR Pediatrics and Parenting is currently publishing a COVID-19 special theme issue in which investigators can share their interim and final research data related to digital approaches to remote pediatric health care delivery in different settings. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly transformed health care systems worldwide, with significant variations and innovations in adaptation. There has been rapid expansion of the leveraging and optimization of digital approaches to health care delivery, particularly integrated telemedicine and virtual health. Digital approaches have played and will play major roles as invaluable and reliable resources to overcome restrictions and challenges imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic and to increase access to effective, accessible, and consumer-friendly care for more patients and families. However, a number of challenges remain to be addressed, and further research is needed. Optimizing digital approaches to health care delivery and integrating them into the public health response will be an ongoing process during the current COVID-19 outbreak and during other possible future pandemics. Regulatory changes are essential to support the safe and wide adoption of these approaches. Involving all relevant stakeholders in addressing current and future challenges as well as logistical, technological, and financial barriers will be key for success. Future studies should consider evaluating the following research areas related to telemedicine and other digital approaches: cost-effectiveness and return on investment; impact on quality of care; balance in use and number of visits needed for the management of both acute illness and chronic health conditions; system readiness for further adoption in other settings, such as inpatient services, subspecialist consultations, and rural areas; ongoing user-centered evaluations, with feedback from patients, families, and health care providers; strategies to optimize health equity and address disparities in access to care related to race and ethnicity, socioeconomic status, immigration status, and rural communities; privacy and security concerns for protected health information with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)-secured programs; confidentiality issues for some specific populations, especially adolescents and those in need of mental health services; early detection of exposure to violence and child neglect; and integration of training into undergraduate and graduate medical education and subspecialty fellowships. Addressing these research areas is essential to understanding the benefits, sustainability, safety, and optimization strategies of telemedicine and other digital approaches as key parts of modern health care delivery. These efforts will inform long-term adoption of these approaches with expanded dissemination and implementation efforts.","Badawy, Radovic","https://doi.org/10.2196/20049","20200702","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; adolescents; children; coronavirus; digital; digital health; digital medicine; eHealth; health care delivery; interventions; mHealth; mobile health; outbreak; pandemic; pediatric; public health; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Psychometric characteristics, reliability and validity in the Israeli population","Mental health clinicians worldwide have been expressing concerns regarding the broad psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (nÂ =Â 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.","Tzur Bitan, Grossman-Giron, Bloch, Mayer, Shiffman, Mendlovic","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100","20200725","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Fear; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The effects of social deprivation on adolescent development and mental health","Adolescence (the stage between 10 and 24 years) is a period of life characterised by heightened sensitivity to social stimuli and the increased need for peer interaction. The physical distancing measures mandated globally to contain the spread of COVID-19 are radically reducing adolescents' opportunities to engage in face-to-face social contact outside their household. In this interdisciplinary Viewpoint, we describe literature from a variety of domains that highlight how social deprivation in adolescence might have far-reaching consequences. Human studies have shown the importance of peer acceptance and peer influence in adolescence. Animal research has shown that social deprivation and isolation have unique effects on brain and behaviour in adolescence compared with other stages of life. However, the decrease in adolescent face-to-face contact might be less detrimental due to widespread access to digital forms of social interaction through technologies such as social media. The findings reviewed highlight how physical distancing might have a disproportionate effect on an age group for whom peer interaction is a vital aspect of development.","Orben, Tomova, Blakemore","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2352-4642(20)30186-3","20200725",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Recommendations for treatment of severe coronavirus disease 2019 based on critical care ultrasound]","Severe patients with COVID-19 are characterized by persistent lung damage, causing respiratory failure, secondary circulatory changes and multiple organ dysfunction after virus invasion. Because of its dynamic, real-time, non-invasive, repeatable and other advantages, critical ultrasonography can be widely used in the diagnosis, assessment and guidance of treatment for severe patients. Based on the recommendations of critical care experts from all over the country who fight against the epidemic in Wuhan, this article summarizes the guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 based on critical ultrasonography, hoping to provide help for the treatment of severe patients. The recommendations mainly cover the following aspects: (1) lung ultrasound in patients with COVID-19 is mainly manifested by thickened and irregular pleural lines, different types of B-lines, shred signs, and other consolidation like dynamic air bronchogram; (2) Echocardiography may show right heart dysfunction, diffuse cardiac function enhancement, stress cardiomyopathy, diffuse cardiac depression and other multiple abnormalities; (3) Critical ultrasonography helps with initiating early treatment in the suspect patient, screening confirmed patients after intensive care unit admission, early assessment of sudden critical events, rapid grading assessment and treatment based on it; (4) Critical ultrasonography helps to quickly screen for the etiology of respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19, make oxygen therapeutic strategy, guide the implementation of lung protective ventilation, graded management and precise off-ventilator; (5) Critical ultrasonography is helpful for assessing the circulatory status of patients with COVID-19, finding chronic cardiopulmonary diseases and guiding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation management; (6) Critical ultrasonography Contributes to the management of organs besides based on cardiopulmonary oxygen transport; (7) Critical ultrasonography can help to improve the success of operation; (8) Critical ultrasonography can help to improve the safety and quality of nursing; (9) When performing critical ultrasonography for patients with COVID-19, it needs to implement three-level protection standard, pay attention to disinfect the machine and strictly obey the rules from nosocomial infection. (10) Telemedicine and artificial intelligence centered on critical ultrasonography may help to improve the efficiency of treatment for the patients with COVID-19.In the face of the global spread of the epidemic, all we can do is to share experience, build a defense line, We hope this recommendations can help COVID-19patients therapy. é‡ç—‡æ–°åž‹å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’è‚ºç‚Ž(COVID-19)æ‚£è€…çš„ç‰¹ç‚¹æ˜¯ç—…æ¯’ä¾µè¢­åŽï¼Œè‚ºéƒ¨æŸå®³æŒç»­åŠ é‡ï¼Œå¼•å‘å‘¼å¸è¡°ç«­ï¼Œå¹¶å‘æˆ–ç»§å‘å¾ªçŽ¯æ”¹å˜ä¸Žå¤šå™¨å®˜åŠŸèƒ½éšœç¢ã€‚é‡ç—‡è¶…å£°å› å…¶åŠ¨æ€ã€å®žæ—¶ã€æ— åˆ›ã€å¯é‡å¤ç­‰ä¼˜ç‚¹ï¼Œå¯å¹¿æ³›ç”¨äºŽé‡ç—‡æ‚£è€…çš„ç—…å› è¯Šæ–­ã€ç—…æƒ…è¯„ä¼°å¹¶æŒ‡å¯¼æ²»ç–—ã€‚çŽ°ä»¥åœ¨æ¹–åŒ—çœæ­¦æ±‰å¸‚æ¥è‡ªå…¨å›½å‚ä¸ŽCOVID-19æ•‘æ²»çš„é‡ç—‡ä¸“å®¶å»ºè®®ä¸ºåŸºç¡€ï¼Œæ€»ç»“å‡ºåŸºäºŽé‡ç—‡è¶…å£°çš„é‡ç—‡COVID-19æ•‘æ²»çš„æŒ‡å¯¼å»ºè®®ï¼Œå¸Œæœ›ä¸ºæ•‘æ²»COVID-19é‡ç—‡æ‚£è€…æä¾›ä¾æ®ã€‚.","Zhang, Yin, He, Zhang, Liu, Zhu, Wu, Cai, Chao, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112138-20200219-00098","20200616","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Coronavirus disease 2019; Critical ultrasonography; Protocol; Therapy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide rates","Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has profound psychological and social effects. The psychological sequelae of the pandemic will probably persist for months and years to come. Studies indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with distress, anxiety, fear of contagion, depression, and insomnia in the general population and among health care professionals. Social isolation, anxiety, fear of contagion, uncertainty, chronic stress, and economic difficulties may lead to the development or exacerbation of depressive, anxiety, substance use, and other psychiatric disorders in vulnerable populations including individuals with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and people who reside in high COVID-19 prevalence areas. Stress-related psychiatric conditions including mood and substance use disorders are associated with suicidal behavior. COVID-19 survivors may also be at elevated suicide risk. The COVID-19 crisis may increase suicide rates during and after the pandemic. Mental health consequences of the COVID-19 crisis including suicidal behavior are likely to be present for a long time and peak later than the actual pandemic. To reduce suicides during the COVID-19 crisis it is imperative to decrease stress, anxiety, fears and loneliness in the general population. There should be traditional and social media campaigns to promote mental health and reduce distress. Active outreach is necessary, especially for people with a history of psychiatric disorders, COVID-19 survivors, and older adults. Research studies are needed of how mental health consequences can be mitigated during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sher","https://doi.org/10.1093/qjmed/hcaa202","20200626","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus disease; depression; economy; suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Care, Convenience, Comfort, Confidentiality, and Contagion: The 5 C's that Will Shape the Future of Telemedicine","The COVID-19 pandemic has driven rapid, widespread adoption of telemedicine. The distribution of clinicians, long travel distances, and disability all limit access to care, especially for persons with Parkinson's disease. Telemedicine is not a panacea for all of these challenges but does offer advantages. These advantages can be summarized as the 5 C's: accessible care, increased convenience, enhanced comfort, greater confidentiality to patients and families, and now reduced risk of contagion. Telemedicine also has its limitations, including the inability to perform parts of the physical examination and inequitable access to the Internet and related technologies. Future models will deliver care to patients from a diverse set of specialties. These will include mental health specialists, physiotherapists, neurosurgeons, speech-language therapists, dieticians, social workers, and exercise coaches. Along with these new care models, digital therapeutics, defined as treatments delivered through software programs, are emerging. Telemedicine is now being introduced as a bridge to restart clinical trials and will increasingly become a normal part of future research studies. From this pandemic will be a wealth of new telemedicine approaches which will fundamentally change and improve care as well as research for individuals with Parkinson's disease.","Dorsey, Okun, Bloem","https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202109","20200615","COVID-19; Parkinson disease; confidentiality; health care reform; organizational innovation; patient comfort; quarantine; telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Neurobiology of COVID-19","Anosmia, stroke, paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, encephalopathy, delirium, meningitis, and seizures are some of the neurological complications in patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) which is caused by acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2). There remains a challenge to determine the extent to which neurological abnormalities in COVID-19 are caused by SARS-Cov2 itself, the exaggerated cytokine response it triggers, and/or the resulting hypercoagulapathy and formation of blood clots in blood vessels throughout the body and the brain. In this article, we review the reports that address neurological manifestations in patients with COVID-19 who may present with acute neurological symptoms (e.g., stroke), even without typical respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, or shortness of breath. Next, we discuss the different neurobiological processes and mechanisms that may underlie the link between SARS-Cov2 and COVID-19 in the brain, cranial nerves, peripheral nerves, and muscles. Finally, we propose a basic &quot;NeuroCovid&quot; classification scheme that integrates these concepts and highlights some of the short-term challenges for the practice of neurology today and the long-term sequalae of COVID-19 such as depression, OCD, insomnia, cognitive decline, accelerated aging, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease in the future. In doing so, we intend to provide a basis from which to build on future hypotheses and investigations regarding SARS-Cov2 and the nervous system.","Fotuhi, Mian, Meysami, Raji","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-200581","20200715","Alzheimerâ€™s disease; COVID-19; SARS-Cov2; anosmia; cerebrovascular disease; cytokines; seizure; vasculitis; Betacoronavirus; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Nervous System Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the &quot;comparison period&quot; (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the &quot;COVID-19 pandemic&quot; (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (nÂ =Â 1650) and the COVID-19 period (nÂ =Â 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity.

"Motivation and preference in isolation: a test of their different influences on responses to self-isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak","This multi-wave study examined the extent that both preference and motivation for time alone shapes ill-being during self-isolation. Individuals in the USA and the UK are self-isolating in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Different motivations may drive their self-isolation: some might see value in it (understood as the identified form of autonomous motivation), while others might feel forced into it by authorities or close others (family, friends, neighbourhoods, doctors; the external form of controlled motivation). People who typically prefer company will find themselves spending more time alone, and may experience ill-being uniformly, or as a function of their identified or external motivations for self-isolation. Self-isolation, therefore, offers a unique opportunity to distinguish two constructs coming from disparate literatures. This project examined preference and motivation (identified and external) for solitude, and tested their independent and interacting contributions to ill-being (loneliness, depression and anxiety during the time spent alone) across two weeks. Confirmatory hypotheses regarding preference and motivation were not supported by the data. A statistically significant effect of controlled motivation on change in ill-being was observed one week later, and preference predicted ill-being across two weeks. However, effect sizes for both were below our minimum threshold of interest.","Weinstein, Nguyen","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200458","20200615","COVID-19; loneliness; motivation; self-isolation; solitude","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This Commentary discusses the pathway involved and recommends in-hospital augmentation with foods or supplements that increase TRP levels for COVID-19 patients treated with INFs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be tried if the depressive symptomatology is not short-lived.","Shader","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113198","20200707","COVID-19; Depression; Interferons; Kynurenine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Beyond the virus: Ensuring continuity of care for people with diabetes during COVID-19","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern for the diabetes community. A meta-analysis in China found that the proportions of people with COVID-19 and diabetes was 9.7% and that having diabetes resulted in a two-fold increased risk of having a severe case. Global guidance on confinement measures for the prevention of COVID-19 have a particular emphasis on vulnerable populations which include people with diabetes. These recommendations are coherent to avoid the spread of SARSCoV-2 infection, but are in contradiction with comprehensive diabetes care, which requires regular patient-provider interactions for patient education, prescriptions and possible management of complications or mental health. Moreover, confinement drives risk for unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, mental health related concerns, in parallel to delayed care-seeking due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Another weakness in the current COVID-19 response is the focus on hospital care which overlooks the importance of Primary Care in guaranteeing continuity of care. Ensuring the availability of insulin, other medicines, self-monitoring and diagnostic tools is another challenge. These are all global concerns for the diabetes community, as well as for those suffering from other chronic conditions. Undoubtedly, the global priority is to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19. However, health systems still need to meet the needs of the entire population, including individuals with diabetes. Clear guidance for preparedness, crisis and post-crisis management of diabetes and chronic diseases during mass disruptions to health systems are lacking. Therefore, in parallel to the epidemic response efforts to ensure existing healthcare services keep running should be supported to avoid health consequences that might be worse than the epidemic itself. This includes targeted messaging for people with diabetes and vulnerable populations with regards to possible risk of infection as well as their disease-related management; continued support via telephone, video conferencing or even home visits; ensuring access to insulin and other medicines and supplies both nationally and individually; and most importantly, preparing for the future.","Beran, Aebischer Perone, Castellsague Perolini, Chappuis, Chopard, Haller, Jacquerioz Bausch, Maisonneuve, Perone, Gastaldi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2020.05.014","20200614","COVID-19; Diabetes; Health systems; Primary Care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Influence of NAD+ as an ageing-related immunomodulator on COVID 19 infection: A hypothesis","The aging-associated decline of biological functions represents an important contributor to the increase in morbidity and mortality of human beings. Of these biological functions deterioration; there is a significant decline in the heart function, impairments in the lungs gas exchange, and impairments in the immune function. Many alterations in the body humeral and cellular immune response were observed with ageing process: The circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines are increased, the naive lymphocytes are decreased, the numbers of the antigen-presenting cells areelevated and the overall response is impaired. In addition, ageing is associated with a progressive restriction in the telomere length. Telomeres are located at chromosomes ends and play an essential role in preserving chromosome stability. Also, telomere length is very important to the immune system, because of the high sensitivity of the immune cells to the shortening of telomeres. Telomeres shortening adversely affect the immune cells' function and developments. These adverse changes increased the susceptibility for severe infection, risk of hospitalization, and even death. Elderly COVID-19 patients are at a real risk of complications due to impaired immune function, cytokine storm and defective respiratory function. Administration of anti-ageing immunomodulation factors like Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide NAD+ can minimize these changes through its potent immunomodulation and longevity effects. NAD+ has a direct inhibitory effect on PARP-1 and can prevent pro-inflammatory cytokines over-activation. Increasing the NAD+ level will also result in stabilizing telomeres and this has a positive impact on immune cells function.","Omran, Almaliki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.06.004","20200614","Ageing; COVID-19; Cytokine storm; NAD+; Telomeres","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"An Internet-Based Intervention to Alleviate Stress During Social Isolation With Guided Relaxation and Meditation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Psychophysiological stress and decreased well-being are relevant issues during prolonged social isolation periods. Relaxation practices may represent helpful exercises to cope with anxiety and stressful sensations. The aim of this research protocol is to test whether remote relaxation practices such as natural sounds, deep respiration, and body scan meditation promote relaxation and improved emotional state and reduce psychomotor activation and the preoccupation related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The study population will consist of 3 experimental groups that will randomly receive one of 3 internet-based audio clips containing a single session of guided breathing exercise, guided body scan exercise, or natural sounds. The participants will listen to the fully automated audio clip for 7 minutes and complete pre-post self-assessment scales on their perceived relaxation, psychomotor activation, level of worry associated with COVID-19, and emotional state. At the end of the session, the participants will also be asked to provide qualitative reports on their subjective experiences. Analyses will be performed to test the differences in the efficacy of the different audio clips in an internet-based intervention on 252 participants (84 per group), investigating whether natural sounds or remote guided practices such as deep respiration and body scan meditation positively enhance the participants' perceived psychological state.

"A simple method for detection of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) using one-step RT-PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism","A novel coronavirus associated with acute respiratory disease (named SARS-CoV-2) is recently identified in Wuhan city, China, spread rapidly worldwide. Early identification of this novel coronavirus by molecular tools is critical for surveillance and control of the epidemic outbreak. We aimed to establish a simple method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV. Primers of our in-house reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays were designed to target conserved regions of the RdRP gene and E gene, selected restriction enzymes EcoRI, Tsp45I, and AluI to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. In this report, a 396-bp fragment of the RdRp gene and 345-bp fragment of the E gene were amplified by one-step RT-PCR. Enzyme Tsp45I cuts the RdRP-amplified product of SARS-CoV-2 generating three fragments of 45, 154, and 197â€‰bp, but it did not cut the amplicon of SARS-CoV. In contrast, the amplified product of SARS-CoV was digested with EcoRI producing two fragments of 76 and 320â€‰bp, whereas the amplicon of SARS-CoV-2 was undigested by Tsp45I help to distinguish clearly SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV on gel electrophoresis. In addition, AluI cut the amplicon of the E gene of SARS-CoV-2 generating two fragments of 248 and 97â€‰bp without cutting to SARS-CoV. The accuracy of the assay was confirmed by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. When evaluated on clinical samples showed a high sensitivity of 95%, specificity of our assay was 100% and clinical performance for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with other reference assays. In conclusion, in the present study, we successfully developed a simple method for molecular detection of SARS-CoV-2 in differentiating with SARS-CoV.","Son, Hang, Thuan, Quyen, Thuong, Nga, Quang, Hung, Son, Linh, Nam, Van Ba, Tien, Quyet, Van Luong, Su","https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26171","20200629","RT-PCR-RFLP; SARS-CoV; coronavirus disease: SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19","Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as &quot;coronaphobia&quot;, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- &quot;COVID-19&quot;, &quot;SARS-CoV2&quot;, &quot;Pandemic&quot;, &quot;Psychology&quot;, &quot;Psychosocial&quot;, &quot;Psychitry&quot;, &quot;marginalized&quot;, &quot;telemedicine&quot;, &quot;mental health&quot;, &quot;quarantine&quot;, &quot;infodemic&quot;, &quot;social media&quot; and&quot; &quot;internet&quot;. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an &quot;infodemic&quot; spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children's usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.","Dubey, Biswas, Ghosh, Chatterjee, Dubey, Chatterjee, Lahiri, Lavie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035","20200722","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Internet; Mental health; Pandemic; Psychosocial; Quarantine; SARS-CoV2; Social media; Stigma; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China","An outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019. Facing this largescale infectious public health event, everyone is under great psychological pressure. The aim was to investigate the psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China. The online cross-sectional study involving 922 participants (656 medical staff and 266 general population) was conducted in China between February and March, 2020. The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (meanÂ =Â 1.49) than that in general population (meanÂ =Â 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratioÂ =Â 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]Â =Â 0.30 to 0.59). Female had a 1.44-fold risk of psychological health problems than male (95% CIÂ =Â 1.01 to 2.03). In the study, 18.3% had psychological health problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. With the remission of the epidemic, the psychological health status of participants has been improved. Medical staff were likely to have higher SCL-90 scores than general population and female had more psychological problems than male. Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions for improving the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zhu, Liu, Jiang, Manandhar, Luo, Zheng, Li, Xie, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.026","20200720","COVID-19; Epidemics; Medical staff; Psychological health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A framework for identifying and mitigating the equity harms of COVID-19 policy interventions","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of 'lockdown' measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, 'flatten the curve'. However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities, but also generate new ones. We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorise adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by LMIC and HIC, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety; depression; food insecurity; loneliness; stigma; violence) appear to be repeated across many groups, and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.","Glover, van Schalkwyk, Akl, Kristjannson, Lotfi, Petkovic, Petticrew, Pottie, Tugwell, Welch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004","20200613","COVID-19; adverse effects; equity; impact assessment; inequity; public health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The possible impairment of respiratory-related neural loops may be associated with the silent pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2","As compared to many other viral pulmonary infections, there existed several peculiar manifestations in the COVID-19 patients, including the &quot;silence&quot; of pneumonia in both mild and severe cases and a long intensive care unit stay for those requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Similar silent pneumonia has been documented in the infectioninduced by H5N1 influenza virus HK483 and was found to result from the direct attack of the virus on the bronchopulmonary C-fibers at the early stage and the final infection in the brainstem at the late stage. The long stay of critical patients in the intensive care unit is possibly due to the depression of central respiratory drive, which resulted in the failure to wean from the mechanic ventilation. Carotid and aortic bodies and bronchopulmonary C-fibers are two key peripheral components responsible for the chemosensitive responses in the respiratory system, while triggering respiratory reflexes depends predominantly on the putative chemosensitive neurons located in the pontomedullary nuclei. In view of the findings for the H5N1 influenza virus, the silence of pneumonia induced by SARS-CoV-2 may be due to the possible impairment of peripheral chemosensitive reflexes as well as the damage to the respiratory-related central neurons.","Tan, Zhang, Gui, Wu, Li","https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26158","20200629","COVID-19; acute respiratory distress; coronavirus; nervous system","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The psychological impact of preexisting mental and physical health conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially changed our daily lives, career trajectories, and sense of safety. Current research posits that younger adults without persisting health conditions may be at reduced risk for complications of COVID-19 infection. However, young adults are often in unstable places in their careers, education, and social lives, which may be more disrupted by policy changes than those of older adults. Thus, it is imperative to identify young adult subgroups who are at increased risk for mental health difficulties to develop targeted interventions to mitigate emotional distress. This study recruited 620 young adults, Ages 18-35 (M = 26.59; SD = 5.24), to determine whether there were differences in self-reported anxiety and depression in the weeks following the pandemic declaration by gender (male, female, or nonbinary) and health status (i.e., the absence of health conditions, the presence of either physical or mental health conditions, and the presence of both physical and mental health conditions) using a 3 Ã— 4 analysis of variance. For both depression and anxiety, nonbinary participants reported the highest levels, followed by female participants. For health status, those with both mental and physical health conditions reported the highest anxiety and depression, followed by those with mental health conditions, physical health conditions, and no health conditions. These findings call for resources to be directed toward individuals who fall into groups reporting greater emotional distress, so that clinicians can intervene as early as possible to prevent mental health decline.

"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target","Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I<sub>h</sub>) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH<sub>3</sub> cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I<sub>h</sub> amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I<sub>h</sub> activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K<sup>+</sup> current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.","Chang, Ragazzi, Liu, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173237","20200724","Ca(2+) current; Hyperpolarization-activated cation current; K(+) current; Membrane potential; Pirfenidone; Pituitary cell; Voltage hysteresis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.","Cohen, Powell, Coleman, Keller, Livingston, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006","20200713","abortion; cervical cancer screening; contraception; coronavirus disease 2019; health equity; intimate partner violence; reproductive healthcare access; telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[How do children and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak?]","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the French government has decided a general lockdown. This unprecedented situation has raised concerns about children's and adolescent's mental health. Children and adolescents diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may find this context of restrained activity particularly tricky. The objectives of our study are to gather information about the well-being and global life conditions of children and adolescents with ADHD during the COVID-19 outbreak in France. We designed a survey including both open-ended questions and questionnaire items for parents of children and adolescents with ADHD. Parents responded to the following open-ended questions: 1) &quot;How is your child doing since the lockdown?&quot; 2) &quot;How is life at home since the lockdown?&quot; 3) &quot;If you had a remote service provision with a mental health professional (e.g. by telephone or video technology), please share your thoughts and any suggestions with us&quot; 4) &quot;Please share any other items that you think are important about ADHD symptoms of your child and the lockdown situation&quot;. This survey was posted on social media on the 6th of April and disseminated by French ADHD-parent and patient organizations. The present article reports the descriptive, qualitative and textometrical analyses of the survey. Between day 20 and 30 of lockdown, 538 parents responded to the survey, and we included 533 responses in the final analysis. The vast majority of responders were women 95Â % (95Â % CI 93,50; 97,18) with children whose mean age was 10,5 (95Â % CI 7.58; 13.44). Since the lockdown, 34.71Â % (95Â % CI 30.70; 38.94) of children experienced a worsening in well-being, 34.33Â % (95Â % CI 30.34; 38.56) showed no significant changes and 30.96Â % (95Â % CI 27.09; 35.10) were doing better according to their parents. The thematic analysis showed that an improvement of their children's anxiety was one of the main topics addressed by parents. This improvement related to less school-related strain and flexible schedules that respected their children's rhythm. Improved self-esteem was another topic that parents linked with a lesser exposure of their children to negative feed-back. Parents repeatedly reported both inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. However, optimal lockdown life conditions seemed to compensate for the impact of ADHD symptoms (e.g. sufficient space at home, presence of a garden). Some parents reported worsening of general well-being in their children, and this manifested as oppositional/defiant attitudes and emotional outbursts. Parents also cited sleep problems and anxiety in this context. As regards everyday life during lock-down, at-home schooling was another major topic-parents described that their children struggled to complete school-related tasks and that teachers seemed to have forgotten about academic accommodations. The lockdown situation seems to have raised parents' awareness of the role of inattention and ADHD symptoms in their children's learning difficulties. Due to potential selection biases, the results of our survey may not be generalizable to all children and adolescents with ADHD. The main strengths of this rapid survey-based study lies in the reactivity of the participants and the quality and diversity of their responses to the open-ended questions. According to their parents, most children and adolescents with ADHD experience stability or improvement of their well-being. An improvement in school-related anxiety and the flexible adjustment to the children's' rhythms as well as parents' increased awareness of the difficulties their children experience are among the key topics in parents' descriptions.","Bobo, Lin, Acquaviva, Caci, Franc, Gamon, Picot, Pupier, Speranza, Falissard, Purper-Ouakil","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.011","20200713","ADHD; Bien-Ãªtre; Children; Confinement; Enfants; Famille; Family; Lockdown; School; TDAH; Well-being; Ã‰cole; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Attitude; Betacoronavirus; Boredom; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Education; Family Relations; Female; France; Housing; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Pandemics; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychology, Adolescent; Psychology, Child; Self Concept; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Protocol for a partially nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the scleroderma patient-centered intervention network COVID-19 home-isolation activities together (SPIN-CHAT) program to reduce anxiety among at-risk scleroderma patients","Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-scoreâ€¯â‰¥â€¯55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention.

"Digital technology for management of severe mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries","Increasingly, digital technologies, especially mobile telecommunications and smartphone apps, are seen as a novel tool for managing severe mental disorders (SMDs) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, there is a need to identify best practices in the use of digital technologies to effectively reach, support, and manage care for patients living with SMDs. In this review, we summarize recent studies using digital technology to manage symptoms and support clinical care for this patient population and discuss new opportunities to advance digital psychiatry research and practice in LMICs. Studies evaluating digital interventions for clinical populations living with SMDs in LMICs are limited. Yet, across recent articles surveyed, digital technology appears to yield diverse benefits for this at-risk patient population. These benefits include improved medication adherence, appointment adherence, reduced instances of relapse, and fewer re-hospitalizations. Continued rigorous research evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of digital technologies in reaching, treating, and managing symptoms and supporting clinical care for patients with SMDs in LMICs is vital. The urgency for remote approaches for delivering specialized psychiatric care is particularly pronounced because of the immediate and long-term impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on access to in-person services. Future research should emphasize participatory approaches rooted in a process of codesign with target users, in order to achieve clinically effective remotely delivered digital mental health interventions.","Merchant, Torous, Rodriguez-Villa, Naslund","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000626","20200610",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The intensive use of the internet by children and adolescents in the context of COVID-19 and the risks for self-inflicted violence","This essay aimed to discuss the implications of social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic for the intensive use of the internet among children and adolescents and its possible consequences for the practice of self-inflicted violence. We briefly discussed the anxiogenic potential and the reproduction of a &quot;global fear&quot; that are consolidated with the massive and unmediated exposure of the content consumed, which can increase the vulnerabilities to stress and suicidal ideas. We centered our debate on &quot;recreational&quot; practices, called &quot;challenges&quot; with self-harm power, carried out by teenagers on the YouTube website. This practice has been shown to increase with the social isolation measures. Our reflection on these risks builds on the theoretical perspective of digital sociability, and its implications for the internet-mediated interactions of adolescents.

"Impact of COVID-19 on mental health in a Low and Middle-Income Country","Mental disorders (MD) are commonly comorbid with cardiovascular, metabolic, and some infectious diseases. Since the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is affecting the most multimorbid individuals, we might expect that the epidemic will be particularly problematic for people with MD. Understanding the burden of an outbreak on mental health is fundamental to effective action towards containing the spread of the disease, as psychopathology might reduce endurance during the lockdown. This can potentially reduce adhesion to ongoing treatment resulting in avoidable recurrence of a disorder. Additionally, there is the stress caused by the eminent risk of infection or economic uncertainty, especially in low-middle income settings. This is an overview on the expected influence of the COVID-19 on mental health from a research group that has not long ago been involved in the Zika epidemic. It aims to discuss the effects of the pandemic on a Low and Middle-Income country (LMIC), Brazil.","Castro-de-Araujo, Machado","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020256.1.10932020","20200617","Betacoronavirus; Bipolar Disorder; Brazil; Caregivers; Coronavirus Infections; Dementia; Developing Countries; Family; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Multimorbidity; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sensation; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Emotions, concerns and reflections regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina]","The scope of this work is to explore the feelings and expectations that COVID-19 has generated in Argentina during the first stage of the pandemic. A survey of the World Health Organization adapted to the local context was applied. Open-ended questions were included to study people's feelings about COVID-19, and content analysis was subsequently conducted. In terms of results, it is revealed that the population surveyed feels uncertainty, fear and anguish, albeit a feeling of responsibility and care in the face of COVID-19 also emerges. Moreover, positive feelings regarding society stand out as an achievement of social interdependence. The results obtained show that the impact on mental health differs in accordance with gender, educational level, and perceived comfort in the home. The study concludes that the emotional and bonding dimensions of people are central to confronting the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina. It is recommended that these dimensions, as well as their subjective and differential social impact among the different population groups, should be considered in the planning of policies to address the COVID-19 pandemic. El objetivo de este trabajo es explorar los sentimientos y expectativas que genera el COVID-19 en Argentina durante la primera etapa de la pandemia. Se aplicÃ³ una encuesta de la OrganizaciÃ³n Mundial de la Salud adaptada al contexto local. Se incluyeron preguntas abiertas para indagar sentimientos de las personas frente al COVID-19, y se realizÃ³ un anÃ¡lisis de contenido. Como resultados se advierte que la poblaciÃ³n encuestada siente incertidumbre, miedo y angustia, pero tambiÃ©n emerge un sentimiento de responsabilidad y cuidado frente al COVID-19. AsÃ­ mismo se destacan sentimientos positivos para la sociedad como una valoraciÃ³n de la interdependencia social. Los resultados arribados seÃ±alan que el impacto en la salud mental es desigual segÃºn el gÃ©nero, el nivel educativo alcanzado y el confort percibido en el hogar. El estudio permite concluir que las dimensiones emocionales y vinculares de las personas resultan aspectos centrales ante la pandemia del COVID-19 en Argentina. Es recomendable que estas dimensiones, asÃ­ como y su impacto subjetivo y social diferencial entre los diversos grupos poblacionales, sean consideradas en la planificaciÃ³n de polÃ­ticas para afrontar el COVID-19.","Johnson, Saletti-Cuesta, Tumas","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232020256.1.10472020","20200617","Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Anxiety; Argentina; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Emotions; Fear; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Impact Assessment; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Uncertainty; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health and Behavior of College Students During the Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Longitudinal Smartphone and Ecological Momentary Assessment Study","The vast majority of people worldwide have been impacted by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P&lt;.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19-related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P&lt;.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related news. Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","Huckins, daSilva, Wang, Hedlund, Rogers, Nepal, Wu, Obuchi, Murphy, Meyer, Wagner, Holtzheimer, Campbell","https://doi.org/10.2196/20185","20200707","COVID-19; anxiety; app; behavior; depression; mental health; mobile sensing; pandemic; phone usage; sedentary; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Ecological Momentary Assessment; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Smartphone; Students; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","While it is well known that mental health problems are common consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.","Tang, Hu, Yang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131","20200612","Alexithymia; COVID-19; Depression; PTSD; Undergraduate","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and the re-opening of schools: a policy maker's dilemma","The epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and rapidly spread across the world. In order to counter this epidemic, several countries put in place different restrictive measures, such as the school's closure and a total lockdown. However, as the knowledge on the disease progresses, clinical evidence showed that children mainly have asymptomatic or mild disease and it has been suggested that they are also less likely to spread the virus. Moreover, the lockdown and the school closure could have negative consequences on children, affecting their social life, their education and their mental health. As many countries have already entered or are planning a phase of gradual lifting of the containment measures of social distancing, it seems plausible that the re-opening of nursery schools and primary schools could be considered a policy to be implemented at an early stage of recovery efforts, putting in place measures to do it safely, such as the maintenance of social distance, the reorganisation of classes into smaller groups, the provision of adequate sanitization of spaces, furniture and toys, the prompt identification of cases in the school environment and their tracing. Therefore, policy makers have the task of balancing pros and cons of the school re-opening strategy, taking into account psychological, educational and social consequences for children and their families. Another issue to be considered is represented by socio-economic disparities and inequalities which could be amplified by school's closure.","Fantini, Reno, Biserni, Savoia, Lanari","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13052-020-00844-1","20200622","COVID-19; Children; Health policy; Lockdown; SARS-CoV-2; School closure; Administrative Personnel; Betacoronavirus; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Global Health; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Schools","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Correlation between Preventive Health Behaviors and Psycho-Social Health Based on the Leisure Activities of South Koreans in the COVID-19 Crisis","COVID-19 has caused unprecedented damage worldwide, and quarantine and lockdown measures have been undertaken globally. This study focused on the differences in preventive behaviors and psycho-social health of South Koreans, as people continue engaging in leisure activities under self-regulation without a lockdown measure imposed by the government. For the sample, the frame of the &quot;2018 Population and Housing Census&quot; in South Korea was applied, and data from 1770 people were analyzed. The results showed that the groups participating in culture and arts and social activities displayed characteristics with high prevention. Additionally, the groups that continued leisure activities for more than five years and with family showed high preventive behaviors. Meanwhile, participation in leisure activities with friends of the opposite sex lowered preventive behavior. In terms of psycho-social health, all groups were affiliated to the potential stress group and there were no differences in the period and participation time for leisure activities. Furthermore, the group participating in leisure activities with their school and group experienced psychological stability. When lockdown measures are eased, the aforementioned characteristics should be considered to design government policy; they can also be used as a reference for public health in case of a future outbreak of an epidemic.","Kim, Cho","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17114066","20200629","COVID-19; leisure; mental health; preventative health behavior; social health; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Behavior; Health Surveys; Humans; Leisure Activities; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Preventive Health Services; Quarantine; Republic of Korea; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Depression, Anxiety and Stress during COVID-19: Associations with Changes in Physical Activity, Sleep, Tobacco and Alcohol Use in Australian Adults","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has enforced dramatic changes to daily living including economic and health impacts. Evidence for the impact of these changes on our physical and mental health and health behaviors is limited. We examined the associations between psychological distress and changes in selected health behaviors since the onset of COVID-19 in Australia. An online survey was distributed in April 2020 and included measures of depression, anxiety, stress, physical activity, sleep, alcohol intake and cigarette smoking. The survey was completed by 1491 adults (mean age 50.5 Â± 14.9 years, 67% female). Negative change was reported for physical activity (48.9%), sleep (40.7%), alcohol (26.6%) and smoking (6.9%) since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Significantly higher scores in one or more psychological distress states were found for females, and those not in a relationship, in the lowest income category, aged 18-45 years, or with a chronic illness. Negative changes in physical activity, sleep, smoking and alcohol intake were associated with higher depression, anxiety and stress symptoms. Health-promotion strategies directed at adopting or maintaining positive health-related behaviors should be utilized to address increases in psychological distress during the pandemic.

"Problematic Internet Use and Perceived Quality of Life: Findings from a Cross-Sectional Study Investigating Work-Time and Leisure-Time Internet Use","Avoiding the potential negative impact brought by problematic internet use is becoming more important. To better understand public health and addiction, this study investigated to what extent work-time and leisure-time internet use relate to problematic internet use and perceived quality of life among college students and highly educated adults. An online cross-sectional survey with 446 individuals was assessed in Germany. Linear regression analyses were used to predict problematic internet use. Ordinal regression analyses were applied to predict perceived quality of life. Results showed that leisure-time internet use, but not work-time internet use, was positively associated with problematic internet use. Participants whose work-time internet use could be considered balanced (5-28 h/week in this study) indicated a higher perceived quality of life compared to individuals with little or large amount of internet use for work. The findings still emerged when taking negative feelings, perceived stress, smoking status and alcohol consumption into account. As both work-time and leisure-time internet use can be risk factors for mental health in terms of problematic internet use and perceived quality of life, well-controlled internet use rather than excessive use is recommended. This should be kept in mind when dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic and its aftermath.","Gao, Gan, Whittal, Lippke","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17114056","20200626","internet addiction; leisure; quality of life; smoking; stress; work","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact of COVID-19 stay-at-home orders on weight-related behaviours among patients with obesity","How the impact of the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders is influencing physical, mental and financial health among vulnerable populations, including those with obesity is unknown. The aim of the current study was to explore the health implications of COVID-19 among a sample of adults with obesity. A retrospective medical chart review identified patients with obesity from an obesity medicine clinic and a bariatric surgery (MBS) practice. Patients completed an online survey from April 15, 2020 to May 31, 2020 to assess COVID-19 status and health behaviours during stay-at-home orders. Logistic regression models examined the impact of these orders on anxiety and depression by ethnic group. A total of 123 patients (87% female, mean age 51.2â€‰years [SD 13.0]), mean BMI 40.2 [SD 6.7], 49.2% non-Hispanic white (NHW), 28.7% non-Hispanic black, 16.4% Hispanic, 7% other ethnicity and 33.1% completed MBS were included. Two patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and 14.6% reported symptoms. Then, 72.8% reported increased anxiety and 83.6% increased depression since stay-at-home orders were initiated. Also 69.6% reported more difficultly in achieving weight loss goals, less exercise time (47.9%) and intensity (55.8%), increased stockpiling of food (49.6%) and stress eating (61.2%). Hispanics were less likely to report anxiety vs NHWs (adjusted odds ratios 0.16; 95% CI, 0.05-0.49; P =â€‰.009). Results here showed the COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on patients with obesity regardless of infection status.

These actions could have an impact on mental health in the general population. The objective of this study was to analyze the differences in psychopathological symptoms shown by Spanish general population during the COVID-19 quarantine based on sociodemographic, occupational and environmental-contextual variables. A cross-sectional pilot study was performed in a sample of 151 participants aged between 18-76 years old. The Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire via online was used to measure the severity of psychopathology symptoms. Socio-demographic, environmental and occupational variables were collected with an ad hoc questionnaire. The data were gathered from the 3rd to the 6th of April, 2020. A descriptive and comparative analysis was carried out using parametric contrasts (t test and ANOVA). The younger participants (18-35 years) showed higher levels of hostility (t=2.24; p=0.02), depression (t=2.56; p=0.01), anxiety (t=2.78; p=0.006) and interpersonal sensitivity (t=2.08; p=0.04) than older participants (36-76 years). The active or employed people presented lower values of depressive symptoms (t=2.10; p=0.04) than unemployed people. The participants who dedicate less than 30 minutes on getting informed about COVID-19 showed higher scores for hostility (t=2.36; p=0.02) and interpersonal sensitivity (t=1.98; p=0.04) than participants who indicated dedicating at least 30 minutes. People who played sport daily reported a lower level of somatization symptoms (t=-2.11; p=0.03) than persons that did not play sport. Those who had relatives, acquaintances, etc. with COVID-19 reported higher levels of anxiety (t=2.09; p=0.04) than those who did not have close people infected. Lastly, participants who lived alone showed a higher level of psychoticism (F=3.93; p=0.02) compared to those who lived with more than two people. The findings of this study show that during quarantine can be identified groups with higher psychological vulnerability based on sociodemographic and occupational-contextual factors. La enfermedad pandÃ©mica por coronavirus (COVID-19) ha hecho necesaria la adopciÃ³n de medidas de cuarentena en diferentes paÃ­ses. Estas medidas podrÃ­an tener un impacto sobre la salud mental de la poblaciÃ³n general en confinamiento. El objetivo del trabajo fue analizar las diferencias en la sintomatologÃ­a psicopatolÃ³gica mostrada por la poblaciÃ³n general espaÃ±ola durante la cuarentena por COVID-19 en funciÃ³n de variables sociodemogrÃ¡ficas, ambientales y ocupacionales. Se realizÃ³ un estudio trasversal en una muestra de 151 participantes, con edades comprendidas entre los 18 y los 76 aÃ±os, en el que se utilizÃ³ de forma online la versiÃ³n espaÃ±ola del Symptom Assessment-45 Questionnaire para medir el nivel de sÃ­ntomas psicopatolÃ³gicos. Se recogieron tambiÃ©n variables sociodemogrÃ¡ficas, ambientales y de ocupaciÃ³n (mediante una encuesta ad hoc). La informaciÃ³n fue recogida del 3 al 6 abril de 2020. Se realizÃ³ un anÃ¡lisis descriptivo y comparativo utilizando contrastes paramÃ©tricos (prueba t y ANOVA). Los participantes mÃ¡s jÃ³venes (18-35 aÃ±os) mostraron niveles mÃ¡s altos de hostilidad (t=2,24; p=0,02), depresiÃ³n (t=2,56; p=0,01), ansiedad (t=2,78; p=0,006) y sensibilidad interpersonal (t=2,08; p=0,04) que los participantes mayores (36-76 aÃ±os). Las personas activas o empleadas presentaron valores mÃ¡s bajos de sÃ­ntomas depresivos (t=2,10; p=0,04) que las personas desempleadas. Los participantes que dedicaron menos de 30 minutos a informarse sobre el COVID-19 mostraron puntuaciones mÃ¡s altas en hostilidad (t=2,36; p=0,02) y sensibilidad interpersonal (t=1,98; p=0,04) que los participantes que indicaron dedicar al menos 30 minutos. Las personas que practicaban deporte diariamente informaron de un menor nivel de sÃ­ntomas de somatizaciÃ³n (t=-2,11; p=0,03) que las personas que no practicaban deporte. Aquellos que tenÃ­an familiares, conocidos, etc. con COVID-19 informaron de niveles mÃ¡s altos de ansiedad (t=2,09; p=0,04) que aquellos que no tenÃ­an a personas cercanas infectadas. Por Ãºltimo, los participantes que vivÃ­an solos mostraron un mayor nivel de psicoticismo (F=3,93; p=0,02) en comparaciÃ³n con aquellos que vivÃ­an con mÃ¡s de dos personas.

"Spring in London with Covid-19: a personal view","This is a personal view from London as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to spread here and the situation changes from day to day. As such it can only be a snapshot caught in time; it is not a diary of events. The Coronavirus Act 2020 gives Government enormous powers and was passed by Parliament in one day of debate immediately before it closed early for the Easter break. In March, the government imposed a &quot;lockdown: the closure of all&quot; but &quot;essential&quot; businesses and people other than essential workers must work from home but are allowed out for exercise and food shopping but must maintain 2 m apart, the &quot;social distancing rule&quot;. The aim is to suppress the spread of the virus, reduce the death toll and &quot;protect the National Health Service (NHS)&quot; which needed time to empty wards and expand its intensive care unit (ICU) capability to deal with an expected influx of thousands of very sick patients. I discuss whether this strategy is working, how and why it has rapidly been altered to respond to criticism. Why was the Government so slow to seek the help of private laboratories to assist with testing? Why was the personal protective equipment (PPE) guidance altered only after criticism? I look at the impact of the lockdown on the UK economy, the changes to practice of medicine and speeding of scientific research. Cooperating with the lockdown has its price; is it harming the health and mental health of children, people living in households with potentially abusive partners or parents and those who are disabled or financially desperate? Is the cure worse than the disease? The Economy is being devastated by the lockdown and each day of lockdown it is worse. Is litigation being seeded even now by the pandemic? Notwithstanding unprecedented Government financial help many businesses are on the edge of collapse, people will lose their jobs and pensioners income. The winners include pharmacies, supermarkets, online food retailers, Amazon, online apps, providers of video games, services, streaming and scientific research laboratories, manufacturers of testing kits, ventilators, hand sanitisers, coffins, undertakers, etc. The British public is cooperating with lockdown but are we less productive at home? Parents with babies and children often child minders, school, grandparents or paid help which is not now available. Will current reliance on video-conferencing and video calls permanently change the way we work and will we need smaller city offices? Will we travel less? Will medical and legal practice and civil and criminal trials be generally carried out remotely? Will social distancing with self-isolation and job losses and business failures fuel depression? Is Covid-19 comparable to past epidemics like the Plague and Spanish flu?","Brahams","https://doi.org/10.1177/0025817220923692","20200720","Coronavirus Act 2020; Covid-19; ICU capability; London; NHS cancels routine surgery and therapies; PPE supply chain; death toll; debt burden; herd immunity; impact on public welfare; indefinite lockdown; is the cure worse than the disease; jobs and business suffer; medical and legal practices; not the Plague; online working; rapid spread; relaxation of research rules; remote education; slowing infection spread; social distancing; staying home; testing; trialling new therapies; up-skilling clinicians; vaccine; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Commerce; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Criminal Law; Depression; Economics; Forecasting; Freedom; Government Regulation; Housing; Humans; Internet; London; Medical Staff, Hospital; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Pandemics; Panic; Personal Autonomy; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health Administration; Quarantine; Schools; Social Control Policies; Social Isolation; Telemedicine; Travel; Triage","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Caring for the carers: Advice for dealing with sleep problems of hospital staff during the COVID-19 outbreak","Hospital staff are at the frontline in the COVID-19 outbreak. The stressors they experience may induce sleep problems in a population already at risk. Sleep deprivation, long shifts and insomnia in hospital staff have been associated with individual, organizational and public health hazards. These include increased risk of mental and somatic disorders, altered immune responses, medical errors, misunderstandings, drowsy driving and burnout. In March 2020, the World Health Organization called for providing access to mental health and counselling for health professionals involved in the COVID-19 outbreak. To answer this call, we propose practical advice for the management of sleep problems (sleep deprivation, insomnia and shift work) that can be included in supportive interventions. The advice is based on psychobiological principles of sleep regulation and on guidelines for the treatment of insomnia and was implemented within an initiative offering psychological support to the staff of three university hospitals in Rome.","Ballesio, Lombardo, Lucidi, Violani","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13096","20200619","COVID-19; infection; insomnia; pandemic; public health; sleep","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Intentional Hydroxychloroquine Overdose Treated with High-Dose Diazepam: an Increasing Concern in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Recent attention on the possible use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine to treat COVID-19 disease has potentially triggered a number of overdoses from hydroxychloroquine. Toxicity from hydroxychloroquine manifests with cardiac conduction abnormalities, seizure activity, and muscle weakness. Recognizing this toxidrome and unique management of this toxicity is important in the COVID-19 pandemic. A 27-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis presented to the emergency department 7Â hours after an intentional overdose of hydroxychloroquine. Initial presentation demonstrated proximal muscle weakness. The patient was found to have a QRS complex of 134Â ms and QTc of 710Â ms. He was treated with early orotracheal intubation and intravenous diazepam boluses. Due to difficulties formulating continuous diazepam infusions, we opted to utilize an intermitted intravenous bolus strategy that achieved similar effects that a continuous infusion would. The patient recovered without residual side effects. Hydroxychloroquine toxicity is rare but projected to increase in frequency given its selection as a potential modality to treat COVID-19 disease. It is important for clinicians to recognize the unique effects of hydroxychloroquine poisoning and initiate appropriate emergency maneuvers to improve the outcomes in these patients.","Chai, Ferro, Kirshenbaum, Hayes, Culbreth, Boyer, Erickson","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13181-020-00790-8","20200713","Adverse Reactions; COVID-19; Chloroquine; Drug-Related Side Effects; hydroxycholorquine; Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Diazepam; Drug Overdose; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Suicide, Attempted; Treatment Outcome; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Social isolation and loneliness among older adults in the context of COVID-19: a global challenge","We are experiencing a historical moment with an unprecedented challenge of the COVID-19 global pandemic. The outbreak of COVID-19 will have a long-term and profound impact on older adults' health and well-being. Social isolation and loneliness are likely to be one of the most affected health outcomes. Social isolation and loneliness areÂ major risk factors that have been linked with poor physical and mental health status. This paper discusses several approaches that may address the issues of social isolation and loneliness. These approaches include promoting social connection as public health messaging, mobilizing the resources from family members, community-based networks and resources, developing innovative technology-based interventions to improve social connections, and engaging the health care system to begin the process of developing methods to identify social isolation and loneliness in health care settings.","Wu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-020-00154-3","20200611","Aging; COVID-19; Public health messaging; Social isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How to deal with COVID-19 epidemic-related lockdown physical inactivity and sedentary increase in youth? Adaptation of Anses' benchmarks","Faced with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, regulatory measures aiming to prevent interpersonal contaminations have been undertaken and among these, lockdown. Due to strong restrictions out-of-home movements, we hypothesize that overall physical activity will decrease and sedentary behavior increase. This could result in highest exposure to the well-known risk related to insufficient physical activity. To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health &amp; Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authorities' prescription, its former benchmarks. This paper supports and comments Anses' Opinion by raising the questions of whether, why, and how to deal with short- or medium-term lockdown-related physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increases. Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted. Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment. Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority. Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown.","Margaritis, Houdart, El Ouadrhiri, Bigard, Vuillemin, DuchÃ©","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-020-00432-z","20200611","Adolescents; Behaviors; COVID-19; Children; Physical activity; Screens; Sedentary lifestyle","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health and psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic: the invisible elephant in the room","The novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus pandemic has emerged as a truly formidable threat to humankind's existence. In the wake of the massively volatile global situation created by COVID-19, it is vital to recognize that the trauma it causes can affect people in different ways, at the individual and collective levels, resulting in mental health challenges for many. Although mentalÂ health problems account for about one-third of the world's disability among adults, these issues tend to be under-addressed and overlooked in society and are closely associated with deadly disease outbreaks. In large scale outbreaks, the mental health problems experienced are not limited to infected persons but also extend to involve frontline health workers and community members alike. While it is crucial to limit the spread of infections during an outbreak, previous experience suggests that mental and behavioural health interventions should be fully included in public health response strategies.","Otu, Charles, Yaya","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00371-w","20200611","Covid-19; Health inequalities; Mental Health; Outbreak; Pandemic; Psychosocial well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for infection prevention: a systematic umbrella review of the global evidence","Transmission of infectious diseases is often prevented by quarantine and isolation of the populations at risk. These approaches restrict the mobility, social interactions, and daily activities of the affected individuals. In recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, quarantine and isolation are being adopted in many contexts, which necessitates an evaluation of global evidence on how such measures impact the mental health outcomes among populations. This umbrella review aimed to synthesize the available evidence on mental health outcomes of quarantine and isolation for preventing infectious diseases. We searched nine major databases and additional sources and included articles if they were systematically conducted reviews, published as peer-reviewed journal articles, and reported mental health outcomes of quarantine or isolation in any population. Among 1,364 citations, only eight reviews met our criteria. Most of the primary studies in those reviews were conducted in high-income nations and in hospital settings. These articles reported a high burden of mental health problems among patients, informal caregivers, and healthcare providers who experienced quarantine or isolation. Prevalent mental health problems among the affected individuals include depression, anxiety, mood disorders, psychological distress, posttraumatic stress disorder, insomnia, fear, stigmatization, low self-esteem, lack of self-control, and other adverse mental health outcomes. This umbrella review found severe mental health problems among individuals and populations who have undergone quarantine and isolation in different contexts. This evidence necessitates multipronged interventions including policy measures for strengthening mental health services globally and promoting psychosocial wellbeing among high-risk populations.","Hossain, Sultana, Purohit","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2020038","20200720","Communicable diseases; Mental disorders; Mental health; Meta-analysis; Quarantine; Systematic review; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Uncovering psychobehavioral implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iran","Iran is the country in Western Asia most impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. A survey was conducted among the general public in Iran aimed at investigating psychobehavioural issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak, namely: 1) barriers to preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection; 2) negative emotions toward SARS-CoV-2 infection; and 3) anxiety levels among the general public in Iran. A cross-sectional, web-based survey using an online questionnaire was carried out between 16 March and 1 April 2020. The six-item version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety levels. A total of 1,789 complete responses were received. Nearly 60% reported having difficulty in wearing a face mask to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total prevention barrier score was 35.8 (SD Â± 7.1; range 18 to 68) out of a possible score of 72. Male respondents [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.51] and respondents who perceived their health status as poor/fair (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.31 to 1.82) were predictors of high prevention barriers. Negative emotions such as fear (74.6%), followed by depression (43.4%) and stigma (23.0%) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Respondents who perceived their health as poor/fair (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.57 to 3.04) reported a higher likelihood of having higher negative emotions. Findings on anxiety level revealed 68.0% (95% CI 65.8 to 70.1) reported moderate to severe anxiety. Respondents who perceived their health as poor/fair (OR = 3.46; 95% CI 12.22 to 5.40) and who were females (OR = 1.91; 95% CI 1.55 to 2.36) were predictors of moderate to severe anxiety.

"Factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical implications for US young adult mental health","This study sought to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology in U.S. young adults (18-30 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores â‰¥ 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores â‰¥ 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores â‰¥ 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety. These factors provide initial guidance regarding the clinical management for COVID-19-related mental health problems.","Liu, Zhang, Wong, Hyun, Hahm","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113172","20200714","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Ethnicity; PTSD; Psychological stress, Loneliness; Social support; University health services","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID 19-Depression and Neurosurgeons","The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20. A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR,Â 0.28). Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.","Sharif, Amin, Hafiz, Benzel, Peev, Dahlan, Enchev, Pereira, Vaishya","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007","20200621","COVID-19; Depression in neurosurgeons; Depression in surgeons; Depression scale; Depression/anxiety; Global neurosurgery; Health care workers; PPE; Pandemic; Safety; Social media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health status of medical staff in emergency departments during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in China","The emergency department is considered to be a high-risk area, as it is often the first stop for febrile patients who are subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei.","Song, Fu, Liu, Luo, Wang, Zhou, Yan, Lv","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002","20200615","COVID-19; Emergency department; Medical staff; Mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Early Impact of COVID-19 on Individuals with Eating Disorders: A survey of ~1000 Individuals in the United States and the Netherlands","We received rapid ethical permission to evaluate the early impact of COVID-19 on people with eating disorders. Participants in the United States (US, N=511) and the Netherlands (NL, N=510), recruited through ongoing studies and social media, completed an online baseline survey that included both quantitative measures and free-text responses assessing the impact of COVID-19 on situational circumstances, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder treatment, and general well-being. Results revealed strong and wide-ranging effects on eating disorder concerns and illness behaviors that were consistent with diagnoses. Participants with anorexia nervosa (US 62% of sample; NL 69%) reported increased restriction and fears about being able to find foods consistent with their meal plan. Individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (US 30% of sample; NL 15%) reported increases in their binge-eating episodes and urges to binge. Respondents noted marked increases in anxiety since 2019 and reported greater concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health than physical health. Although many participants acknowledged and appreciated the transition to telehealth, limitations of this treatment modality for this population were raised.

"COVID-19 pandemic: every day feels like a weekday to most","The COVID-19 outbreak has clear clinical and economic impacts, but also affects behaviors e.g. through social distancing, and may increase stress and anxiety. However, while case numbers are tracked daily, we know little about the psychological effects of the outbreak on individuals in the moment. Here we examine the psychological and behavioral shifts over the initial stages of the outbreak in the United States in an observational longitudinal study. Through GPS phone data we find that homestay is increasing, while being at work dropped precipitously. Using regular real-time experiential surveys we observe an overall increase in stress and mood levels which is similar in size to the weekend vs. weekday differences. As there is a significant difference between weekday and weekend mood and stress levels, this is an important decrease in wellbeing. For some, especially those affected by job loss, the mental health impact is severe.","Liu, Meyerhoff, Mohr, Ungar, Kording","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.11.20098228","20200608",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 during disease outbreak: prevalence and associated biopsychosocial risk factors","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) - a novel and highly infectious pneumonia - has now spread across China and beyond for over four months. However, its psychological impact on patients is unclear. We aim to examine the prevalence and associated risk factors for psychological morbidities and fatigue in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Amidst the disease outbreak, 41 out of 105 COVID-19 patients in a local designated hospital in China were successfully assessed using a constellation of psychometric questionnaires to determine their psychological morbidities and fatigue. Several potential biopsychosocial risk factors (including pre-existing disabilities, CT severity score of pneumonia, social support, coping strategies) were assessed through multivariable logistic regression analyses to clarify their association with mental health in patients. 43.9% of 41 patients presented with impaired general mental health, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, 26.8% had anxiety and/or depression symptoms, and 53.6% had fatigue. We did not find any association between pneumonia severity and psychological morbidities or fatigue in COVID-19 patients. However, high perceived stigmatization was associated with an increased risk of impaired general mental health and high perceived social support was associated with decreased risk. Besides, negative coping inclination was associated with an increased risk of PTSD symptoms; high perceived social support was associated with a decreased risk of anxiety and/or depression symptoms. Psychological morbidities and chronic fatigue are common among COVID-19 patients. Negative coping inclination and being stigmatized are primary risk factors while perceived social support is the main protective factor.","Qi, Chen, Liu, Thompson, Zhang, Xia, Cheng, Hong, Surento, Luo, Sun, Zhou, Li, Jiang, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.08.20031666","20200608","coronavirus disease 2019; fatigue; mental morbidities; post-traumatic stress disorder symptom; social support; stigmatization","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Factors Contributing to Healthcare Professional Burnout During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Turnaround Global Survey","Healthcare professionals (HCPs) on the front lines against COVID-19 may face increased workload, and stress. Understanding HCPs risk for burnout is critical to supporting HCPs and maintaining the quality of healthcare during the pandemic. To assess exposure, perceptions, workload, and possible burnout of HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic we conducted a cross-sectional survey. The main outcomes and measures were HCPs self-assessment of burnout and other experiences and attitudes associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2,707 HCPs from 60 countries participated in this study. Fifty-one percent of HCPs reported burnout. Burnout was associated with work impacting household activities (RR=1.57, 95% CI=1.39-1.78, P&lt;0.001), feeling pushed beyond training (RR=1.32, 95% CI=1.20-1.47, P&lt;0.001), exposure to COVID-19 patients (RR=1.18, 95% CI=1.05-1.32, P=0.005), making life prioritizing decisions (RR=1.16, 95% CI=1.02-1.31, P=0.03). Adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) was protective against burnout (RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.79-0.97, P=0.01). Burnout was higher in high-income countries (HICs) compared to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.02-1.36, P=0.018). Burnout is prevalent at higher than previously reported rates among HCPs working during the COVID-19 pandemic and is related to high workload, job stress, and time pressure, and limited organizational support. Current and future burnout among HCPs could be mitigated by actions from healthcare institutions and other governmental and non-governmental stakeholders aimed at potentially modifiable factors, including providing additional training, organizational support, support for family, PPE, and mental health resources.

"Coronavirus and PARP expression dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: a potentially actionable component of innate immunity","SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus (CoV) and cause of COVID-19, which is much more lethal in older people and those with comorbid conditions for unknown reasons. Innate immune responses to CoVs are initiated by recognition of double-stranded RNA and induction of interferon, which turns on a gene expression program that inhibits viral replication. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection of cells, ferrets and a person strikingly dysregulates the NAD gene set by inducing a set of PARP family members that includes enzymes required for the innate immune response to CoVs. CoV infection also induces a severe attack on host cell NAD. Overexpression of one induced enzyme, PARP10, is sufficient to depress host NAD. Gene expression and pharmacological data suggest that boosting NAD through the nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside kinase pathways may restore antiviral PARP functions to support innate immunity to CoVs, whereas PARP1,2 inhibition does not restore PARP10 activity.","Heer, Sanderson, Alhammad, Schmidt, Trammell, Perlman, Cohen, Fehr, Brenner","https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.17.047480","20200719","ADP-ribosylhydrolase; Biochemistry &amp; Chemical Biology; COVID-19; MHV; Microbiology &amp; Infectious Disease; PARP; SARS-CoV-2; innate immunity; interferon","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Coronavirus disease 2019 and stroke in Iran: a case series and effects on stroke admissions","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has affected healthcare systems around the globe and massively impacted patients with various non-infectious, life-threatening conditions. Stroke is a major neurological disease contributing to death and disability worldwide, and is still an ongoing issue during the pandemic. Here we investigate the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on stroke manifestations, treatment courses, the outcome of stroke patients, and the hospitalization rate in a referral center for stroke management in Tehran, Iran. We extracted data regarding 31 stroke patients (10 patients with laboratory-confirmed coronavirus disease 2019) and compared the demographic and pathological characteristics of the patients with or without coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The association of demographic/pathological characteristics of stroke patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a corresponding period during the previous year (49 patients) and an earlier period during the same year as the pandemic (50 patients) was also evaluated. The absolute number of admissions decreased about 40% during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Except for the stroke severity (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.002), there were no significant changes in the demographic and pathological characteristics of the stroke patients during the three studied periods. A significantly higher mean of age (75.60â€‰Â±â€‰9.54 versus 60.86â€‰Â±â€‰18.45; Pâ€‰=â€‰0.007), a significant difference in the type of stroke (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.046), and significantly higher stroke severity (Pâ€‰=â€‰0.024) were observed in stroke patients with coronavirus disease 2019 compared with those of stroke patients without coronavirus disease 2019. Treatment approaches, duration of hospitalization, and mortality rates did not differ significantly. This report shows that the pandemic caused the number of acute stroke admissions to plummet compared to other periods. Although the pandemic did not affect the treatment plans and care of the patients, stroke cases with coronavirus disease 2019 had higher age, more large vessel ischemic stroke, and more severe stroke. Further studies are urgently needed to realize the probable interaction of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the neurologic disease.","Mehrpour, Shuaib, Farahani, Hatamabadi, Fatehi, Ghaffari, Moghadam, Aghamiri, Mansouri, Assarzadegan, Lima, Hesami","https://doi.org/10.1177/1747493020937397","20200701","Coronavirus disease 2019; acute stroke; cerebrovascular disease; neurology; pandemic; stroke","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Covid-19: factors associated with emotional distress and psychological morbidity in spanish population]","The socio-health emergency caused by COVID-19 may have a significant psychological impact on the population. For this reason, it is necessary to identify especially vulnerable social groups and protective factors that may reduce this impact, which was the objective of this study. Using snowball sampling approach, 1,596 people residing in Spain during the lockdown answered an online questionnaire that included information on sociodemographic variables, symptoms, and contact with the disease, risk perception, precautionary measures to prevent infection and coping strategies during lockdown. Psychological impact was assessed using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status with the Goldberg's General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Simple linear regression models were performed to analyze the associations between the study variables and the psychological impact of the pandemic and the mental health of the participants. Of all respondents, 24.7% reported a moderate or severe psychological impact, and 48.8% showed mental health problems. Women, students and the population with a lower level of economic income, in addition to those having less available space per person in the household presented a more significant psychological impact and worse mental health. Living with someone from the high-risk vulnerable group, and anticipating the adverse economic effects of social-health crisis raised the emotional distress and psychological morbidity. Precautionary measures to prevent infection did not present a connection to the psychological impact of the pandemic; however, several coping strategies did help to reduce it. These findings outline the existence of especially vulnerable social groups to the impact of the pandemic, and suggest lines of action that help reduce the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with pre-existing anxiety disorders attending secondary care","To examine the psychological and social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with established anxiety disorders during a period of stringent mandated social restrictions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis of an anxiety disorder to determine the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on anxiety and mood symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. Twelve (40.0%) participants described COVID-19 restrictions as having a deleterious impact on their anxiety symptoms. Likert scale measurements noted that the greatest impact of COVID-19 related to social functioning (mean = 4.5, SD = 2.9), with a modest deleterious effect on anxiety symptoms noted (mean = 3.8, SD = 2.9). Clinician rated data noted that 8 (26.7%) participants had disimproved and 14 (46.7%) participants had improved since their previous clinical review, prior to commencement of COVID-19 restrictions. Conditions associated with no 'trigger', such as generalised anxiety disorder, demonstrated a non-significant increase in anxiety symptoms compared to conditions with a 'trigger', such as obsessive compulsive disorder. Psychiatric or physical comorbidity did not substantially impact on symptomatology secondary to COVID-19 mandated restrictions. The psychological and social impact of COVID-19 restrictions on individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders has been modest with only minimal increases in symptomatology or social impairment noted.","Plunkett, Costello, McGovern, McDonald, Hallahan","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.75","20200702","Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; obsessive compulsive disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Comparative analysis of perceived stress in dermatologists and other physicians during national lock-down and COVID-19 pandemic with exploration of possible risk factors: A web-based cross-sectional study from Eastern India","Since the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as global pandemic, several countries including India have enforced a national lock-down. We aimed to compare the perceived stress of dermatologists and nondermatologists, due to lock-down and COVID-19 pandemic and analyze the role of possible risk factors. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study to determine the perceived stress of doctors using the Perceived Stress Scale-10 and evaluate possible risk factors. Among 384 valid responders, we had 37.5% dermatologists and 62.5% nondermatologists. Perceived stress was more in nondermatologists compared to dermatologists, but not statistically significant (P = 0.1). Degree of stress was also comparable (P = 0.5). Higher stress was significantly associated with females and unmarried individuals in both groups. Risk of infecting self or colleagues or family members and lack of protective gear at work place were top causes of stress. Perceived stress is increased in all doctors due to COVID-19 pandemic and lock-down. Even dermatologists have developed high stress due to current situation, comparable to nondermatologists, despite being traditionally considered an outpatient speciality with minimum stress. Thus, proper mental health care policies should be adopted for all doctors, including dermatologists.","Podder, Agarwal, Datta","https://doi.org/10.1111/dth.13788","20200706","COVID-19; dermatologists; lock-down; nondermatologists; pandemic; perceived stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Media use and acute psychological outcomes during COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 outbreak in China led to an extraordinary threat to public health and wellbeing. This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.","Chao, Xue, Liu, Yang, Hall","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248","20200720","Anxiety; COVID-19; Disaster; Media use; Mental health; New media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Rapid Systematic Review: The Impact of Social Isolation and Loneliness on the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in the Context of COVID-19","Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 01/01/1946 and 03/29/2020. 20% of articles were double screened using pre-defined criteria and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n=51,576; mean age 15.3) 61 studies were observational; 18 were longitudinal and 43 cross sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time loneliness was measured and between 0.25 to 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and probably anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventative support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.","Loades, Chatburn, Higson-Sweeney, Reynolds, Shafran, Brigden, Linney, McManus, Borwick, Crawley","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.05.009","20200609","COVID-19; disease containment; loneliness; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

With the dismantling of routines and practices in the hospital, training activities such as daily rounds, conferences, and examinations were temporarily put on hold. Recognizing that the strength of any clinical training program is its wealth of patients, the immediate resumption of patient services, albeit limited at first, had been instrumental in ensuring the continuation of training in our institution. Opportunistic teaching-learning strategies between the faculty and fellows were devised. Innovative approaches to learning such as the use of online meeting platforms for division conferences, webinars, examinations, and other learning activities were initiated. Emphasis was given on the important considerations in the management of cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The emotional and psychological well-being of the faculty and fellows during this crisis were considered and a mental health assessment was conducted prior to the resumption of training activities.","Chua, Mendoza, Ando, Planilla, Fernando, Strebel, Ignacio","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-020-01786-2","20200609",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Are we all in this together? Longitudinal assessment of cumulative adversities by socioeconomic position in the first 3 weeks of lockdown in the UK","Despite media claims that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is uniting societies and countries in shared experience, there has been concern that the pandemic is in fact exposing and widening existing inequalities within societies. Data have shown these differences for cases and fatalities, but data on other types of adversities are lacking. Therefore, this study explored the changing patterns of adversity relating to the COVID-19 pandemic by socioeconomic position (SEP) during the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. Data were from 12Â 527 UK adults in the University College London COVID-19 Social Study (a panel study that involves online weekly data collection from participants during the COVID-19 pandemic). We analysed data collected from 25 March to 14 April 2020. The sample was well-stratified and weighted to population proportions of gender, age, ethnicity, education and country of living. We used Poisson and logit models to assess 10 different types of adverse experiences depending on an index of SEP over time. There was a clear gradient across the number of adverse events experienced each week by SEP. This was most clearly seen for adversities relating to finances (including loss of employment and cut in income) and basic needs (including access to food and medications) but less for experiences directly relating to the virus. Inequalities were maintained with no reductions in discrepancies between socioeconomic groups over time. There were clear inequalities in adverse experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic in the early weeks of lockdown in the UK. Results suggest that measures taken to try to reduce such adverse events did not go far enough in tackling inequality.","Wright, Steptoe, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1136/jech-2020-214475","20200619","Cohort studies; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MENTAL HEALTH; PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS; PUBLIC HEALTH","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Distress and Resilience in the Days of COVID-19: Comparing Two Ethnicities","The COVID-19 pandemic is an ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome, which has spread recently worldwide. Efforts to prevent the virus from spreading include travel restrictions, lockdowns as well as national or regional quarantines throughout the international community. The major negative psychological outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic is the anxiety caused by it. The aim of the present study was to examine the level of concern and the contributions of modes of resilience, well-being and demographic attributes towards decreasing or enhancing anxiety and depression among two samples: Israeli Jews (majority group) and Israeli Arabs (minority group). These random samples included 605 Jews and 156 Arabs who participated in an internet survey. A previous study, which has been conducted in the context of terror attacks, has shown that compared to Israeli Jews, Israeli Arabs expressed a higher level of fear of war and lower levels of resilience supporting personality attributes.

"Psychosocial and Behavioral Impact of COVID-19 in Autism Spectrum Disorder: An Online Parent Survey","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak could result in higher levels of psychological distress, especially among people suffering from pre-existing mental health conditions. Young individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are particularly at risk due to their vulnerability to unpredictable and complex changes. This study aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ASD individuals, whether any pre-pandemic sociodemographic or clinical characteristics would predict a negative outcome, and to narratively characterize their needs. Parents and guardians of ASD individuals filled out an online survey consisting of 40 questions investigating socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of their children, impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on their wellbeing and needs to deal with the emergency. Data were available on 527 survey participants. The COVID-19 emergency resulted in a challenging period for 93.9% of families, increased difficulties in managing daily activities, especially free time (78.1%) and structured activities (75.7%), and, respectively, 35.5% and 41.5% of children presenting with more intense and more frequent behavior problems. Behavior problems predating the COVID-19 outbreak predicted a higher risk of more intense (odds ratio (OR) = 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.42-3.29) and more frequent (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.48) disruptive behavior. Even though ASD children were receiving different types of support, also requiring specialist (19.1%) or emergency (1.5%) interventions in a relatively low proportion of cases, a number of needs emerged, including receiving more healthcare support (47.4%), especially in-home support (29.9%), as well as interventions to tackle a potentially disruptive quarantine (16.8%). The COVID-19 outbreak has undoubtedly resulted in increased difficulties among ASD individuals.","Colizzi, Sironi, Antonini, Ciceri, Bovo, Zoccante","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci10060341","20200723","2019-nCoV; child and adolescent psychiatry; coronavirus; mental health prevention; neurodevelopment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The evaluation of sleep disturbances for Chinese frontline medical workers under the outbreak of COVID-19","To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (FMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and make a comparison with non-FMW. The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI&gt;6 points or/and AIS&gt;6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3Â Â±Â 3.8 vs 7.5Â Â±Â 3.7; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001; Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.47), AIS (6.9Â Â±Â 4.3 vs 5.3Â Â±Â 3.8; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001; Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.38), anxiety (4.9Â Â±Â 2.7 vs 4.3Â Â±Â 2.6; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001; Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.22) and depression (4.1Â Â±Â 2.5 vs 3.6Â Â±Â 2.4; PÂ =Â 0.001; Cohen's dÂ =Â 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQIÂ &gt;Â 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR]Â =Â 1.29; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and AISÂ &gt;Â 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RRÂ =Â 1.45; PÂ &lt;Â 0.001).

"Orthopaedic Guidelines for the COVID-19 Post-Outbreak Period: Experience from Wuhan, People's Republic of China","Currently, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis has rapidly spread worldwide. As the earliest outbreak area of the pandemic, Wuhan, People's Republic of China, is gradually recovering to its normal state under the effective control of government authorities. Outpatient services in major hospitals are now being restored. An accumulation of asymptomatic infections is a potential risk for medical personnel, especially when there is crowding in hospitals. As the biggest center for orthopaedic patients in Wuhan, our orthopaedic outpatient department admits &gt;300 patients per day. Optimal guidelines on how to handle this huge number of patients during the post-outbreak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with regard to potential asymptomatic infection, are urgently needed for orthopaedic surgeons. We have developed and proposed applicable guidelines to fill this knowledge gap, including the necessary protective strategies for medical personnel in orthopaedic outpatient and inpatient wards as well as during surgery. We also have provided mental health recommendations for health-care workers. To the best of our knowledge, these guidelines are the first of their kind for orthopaedic surgeons who are slowly reestablishing medical activity following the pandemic.","Xiong, Chen, Lin, Panayi, Mi, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2106/JBJS.20.00773","20200605",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Closing the Psychological Treatment Gap During the COVID-19 Pandemic With a Supportive Text Messaging Program: Protocol for Implementation and Evaluation","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread globally with far-reaching, significant, and unprecedented impacts on health and everyday life. Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction. The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians. The prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; the demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope intervention in mitigating distress will be evaluated. Self-administered anonymous online questionnaires will be used to assess stress (Perceived Stress Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale [GAD-7]), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of SMS text messaging), the program midpoint (6 weeks), and the program endpoint (12 weeks). Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction. Given the large size of the data set, machine learning and data mining methods will also be used. This COVID-19 project will provide key information regarding prevalence rates of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms during the pandemic; demographic correlates of distress; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for practitioners and useful for informing policy and decision making regarding psychological interventions during the pandemic.

"On the clinical psychologist's role in the time of COVID-19, with particular reference to experience gained in pediatric oncology","The COVID-19 pandemic seems to be developing into a planetary-scale mental health experiment, undermining the foundations of our being human, obliging us to keep physically apart from one another, and inducing us to see other people as a potential threat. In the world of pediatric oncology, we have found ourselves up against new challenges. In this article, we discuss the difficulties found in conducting psychological support sessions while complying with physical distancing rules, as well as wearing protective face masks, and even gloves; or while using modern remote communication telecommunications. The classic reasons behind requests for psychological support have been compounded by other, novel problems, such as: fewer relational resources for families at home, less chance to socialize, hospital stays with only one parent, the suspension of all teaching and group activities on the ward, economic difficulties caused by the pandemic, the rising levels of family conflictuality and generalized anxiety. It is essential to find new solutions that can be promptly implemented, reconfiguring the way we humanize our hospital wards.","Clerici, Massimino, Ferrari","https://doi.org/10.1002/pon.5418","20200619","COVID-19; pediatric oncology; psychological support; remote communication; social distancing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

While there is no current evidence of vaccines and specific drugs to prevent and treat the ailments emanating from NCOVID-19 infections, complementary and conventional medical treatments could prove beneficial in ameliorating some of the respiratory difficulties, especially in countries in sub-Saharan Africa. These treatments include specific breathing exercises, a diet that strengthens the immune system, as well as avoiding tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. On the other hand, for those who have not contracted the virus, participation in indoor and within-the-yard physical activity could be beneficial in preventing unwanted weight gain as well as associated conditions such as anxiety and depression.","Onagbiye, Mchiza, Bassett, Travill, Eijnde","https://doi.org/10.4102/phcfm.v12i1.2453","20200616","NCOVID-19; SSA; physical exercise; respiratory difficulties; well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Clinical update on COVID-19 in pregnancy: A review article","The data pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic has been rapidly evolving since the first confirmed case in December 2019. This review article presents a comprehensive analysis of the current data in relation to COVID-19 and its effect on pregnant women, including symptoms, disease severity and the risk of vertical transmission. We also review the recommended management of pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and the various pharmacological agents that are being investigated and may have a role in the treatment of this disease. At present, it does not appear that pregnant women are at increased risk of severe infection than the general population, although there are vulnerable groups within both the pregnant and nonpregnant populations, and clinicians should be cognizant of these high-risk groups and manage them accordingly. Approximately 85% of women will experience mild disease, 10% more severe disease and 5% critical disease. The most common reported symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and diarrhea. Neither vaginal delivery nor cesarean section confers additional risks, and there is minimal risk of vertical transmission to the neonate from either mode of delivery. We acknowledge that the true effect of the virus on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality will only be evident over time. We also discuss the impact of social isolation can have on the mental health and well-being of both patients and colleagues, and as clinicians, we must be mindful of this and offer support as necessary.","Ryan, Purandare, McAuliffe, Hod, Purandare","https://doi.org/10.1111/jog.14321","20200619","COVID-19 and breastfeeding; COVID-19 and pregnancy; coronavirus and pregnancy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The Mental Health Consequences of Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Dentistry","With the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), strict isolation strategies to limit virus transmission have been applied worldwide. The lockdown has affected and challenged different medical areas. Doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health care workers are concerned about contagion, not only for themselves, but also for their families and colleagues. Furthermore, the oral mucosa has been accepted as a high-risk route of transmission for COVID-19. In many countries, dentists have been forced to stop working during quarantine until further notification. Isolation and its financial impact have produced physical and psychological pressure, depression, social anxiety, and other mental health concerns. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of the consequences of past epidemics on mental health and to assess possible aspects that might be associated with mental implications in dentists during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Related Health Factors of Psychological Distress During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Spain","Measures to prevent and contain the COVID-19 health crisis include population confinement, with the consequent isolation and interruption of their usual activities. The aim of the study is to analyse psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. For this, a cross-sectional observational study with a sample of 4180 people over the age of 18 during quarantine was developed. Variables considered were sociodemographic variables, physical symptoms, health conditions, COVID-19 contact history and psychological adjustment. The data were collected through a self-developed questionnaire and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Bivariate analyses were performed, including Chi-Squared test and Student's T-test. Predictive ability was calculated through logistic regression. Results obtained showed a high level of psychological distress (72.0%), with a higher percentage in women and people of lower middle age. Statistically significant differences were found in the variable working situation (Ï‡Â² = 63.139, <i>p</i><i>â‰¤</i> 0.001, V = 0.123) and living with children under the age of 16 (Ï‡Â² = 7.393, <i>p</i> = 0.007, V = 0.042).

"The Psychological Impacts of a COVID-19 Outbreak on College Students in China: A Longitudinal Study","An outbreak in Wuhan, China in late 2019 of a highly infectious new coronary pneumonia (COVID-19) led to the imposition of countrywide confinement measures from January to March 2020. This is a longitudinal study on changes in the mental health status of a college population before and after their COVID-19 confinement for the first two weeks, focusing on states of psychological distress, depression, anxiety and affectivity. The influence of possible stressors on their mental health were investigated, including inadequate supplies and fears of infection. Five hundred and fifty-five undergraduate students were recruited from Hebei Agricultural University in Baoding, China. The participants completed two online surveys-on anxiety and depression, and on positive and negative affect. One survey was conducted before the confinement and the other was conducted 15-17 days after the start of the confinement. Increases in negative affect and symptoms of anxiety and depression (<i>p</i>-values &lt; 0.001) were observed after 2 weeks of confinement. Inadequate supplies of hand sanitizers, a higher year of study, and higher scores on anxiety and depression were common predictors of increased negative affect, anxiety, and depression across the confinement period. The results suggest that healthcare policymakers should carefully consider the appropriate confinement duration, and ensure adequate supplies of basic infection-control materials.","Li, Cao, Leung, Mak","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17113933","20200622","COVID-19; anxiety; college students; depression; longitudinal study; mood; Adolescent; China; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Policy Making; Quarantine; Students; Time Factors; Universities","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of Rumors and Misinformation on COVID-19 in Social Media","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has not only caused significant challenges for health systems all over the globe but also fueled the surge of numerous rumors, hoaxes, and misinformation, regarding the etiology, outcomes, prevention, and cure of the disease. Such spread of misinformation is masking healthy behaviors and promoting erroneous practices that increase the spread of the virus and ultimately result in poor physical and mental health outcomes among individuals. Myriad incidents of mishaps caused by these rumors have been reported globally. To address this issue, the frontline healthcare providers should be equipped with the most recent research findings and accurate information. The mass media, healthcare organization, community-based organizations, and other important stakeholders should build strategic partnerships and launch common platforms for disseminating authentic public health messages. Also, advanced technologies like natural language processing or data mining approaches should be applied in the detection and removal of online content with no scientific basis from all social media platforms. Furthermore, these practices should be controlled with regulatory and law enforcement measures alongside ensuring telemedicine-based services providing accurate information on COVID-19.","Tasnim, Hossain, Mazumder","https://doi.org/10.3961/jpmph.20.094","20200617","COVID-19; Health impacts; Misinformation; Social media; Betacoronavirus; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

An online survey is conducted to assesÂ psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks.

We examined the role of socioeconomic, mental health, and pro-inflammatory factors in a community-based sample. We used data on 340,966 men and women (mean age 56.2Â years) from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort study with linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between ethnicity and hospitalisation for COVID-19. There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571/324,306 White, 31/4,485 Black, 21/5,732 Asian, 17/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval: 4.32; 3.00-6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the 'other' non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for potential explanatory factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, household crowding, smoking, body size, inflammation, glycated haemoglobin, and mental illness, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33% for Blacks, 52% for Asians and 43% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31).

"COVID-19: Implications for the Support of People with Social Care Needs in England","This perspective examines the challenge posed by COVID-19 for social care services in England and describes responses to this challenge. People with social care needs experience increased risks of death and deteriorating physical and mental health with COVID-19. Social isolation introduced to reduce COVID-19 transmission may adversely affect well-being. While the need for social care rises, the ability of families and social care staff to provide support is reduced by illness and quarantine, implying reductions in staffing levels. Consequently, COVID-19 could seriously threaten care availability and quality. The government has sought volunteers to work in health and social care to help address the threat posed by staff shortages at a time of rising need, and the call has achieved an excellent response. The government has also removed some barriers to effective coordination between health and social care, while introducing measures to promote the financial viability of care providers.

However, there is limited availability of psychometric measures to document COVID-19-related anxiety among the general public. This study was aimed at developing a validated scale to measure COVID-19-related anxiety. Three hundred and seven subjects from different gender, educational categories participated in the study. Exploratory factor analysis for the determination of factor structure, Pearson's correlation test, and Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA were employed in data analysis using SPSS version 20 software.

"Fear of COVID-19 and the mental health consequences in America","The intent of this work was to examine the intersection of COVID-19 fear with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences among adults living in the United States. Data are from a nationally representative sample (<i>n</i> = 10,368) of U.S. adults surveyed online during demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race and ethnicity, geography). The sample week of March 23, 2020. The sample was poststratification weighted to ensure a balanced representation across social and demographic subgroups (gender, age, income, race or ethnicity, geography). The sample comprised 51% female; 23% non-White; 18% Hispanic; 25% of households with children under 18 years of age; 55% unmarried; and nearly 20% unemployed, laid off, or furloughed at the time of the interview. Respondents were fearful, averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19. Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentrated in regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. census regions are noted (<i>p</i> &lt; .01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between socially vulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as well as with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, on average, were high (16+ on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25% of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms. More in-depth psychosocial research is needed using nationally representative samples that can help to inform potential mental health risks, as well as by targeting specific mental health interventions.

"[Exploring the Stress, Psychological Distress, and Stress-relief Strategies of Taiwan Nursing Staffs Facing the Global Outbreak of COVID-19]","The global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) began in December 2019. The high levels of stress experienced by nurses during this pandemic may have immediate and long-term effects on their mental health. To explore the stress and psychological problems of nurses during this pandemic and to identify strategies used by these nurses to relieve stress. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted that included a basic information datasheet, stress of nursing staff during COVID-19 outbreak scale, psychological distress scale, and stress relief methods survey form. Convenience sampling was used and a total of 469 practicing nurses participated in this study. Most of the participants expressed concerns about living problems (72.7%). On the stress questionnaire, the facets of &quot;burden of taking care of patients&quot; and &quot;worries about social isolation&quot; earned the first and second highest scores, respectively. In terms of items, &quot;worrying about infecting family members and friends&quot; and &quot;worrying about being separated from family after being infected&quot; earned the two highest scores (2.35 Â± 0.79 and 2.17 Â± 0.92, respectively). Scores for psychological distress averaged 5.49 Â± 3.83, with stress anxiety (1.32 Â± 0.84) earning the highest mean subscale score followed by distress and irritability (1.17 Â± 0.92) and depression (1.12 Â± 0.94). Nearly two-thirds (61.8%) of the participants earned psychological and emotional distress scores within the 'normal' range, and 3.4% earned scores indicating severe distress. &quot;Receiving education and training&quot; was the most common method used by the participants to relieve stress (2.27 Â± 0.51). The following six strategies are proposed based on the above findings: (1) Caring: provide psychological assessment and care; (2) Supporting: create a friendly team atmosphere and provide support; (3) Inquiring: recruit volunteers with relevant experience; (4) Informing: provide timely, open, and transparent epidemic-prevention information; (5) Equipping: provide complete and appropriate epidemic-prevention education and training; (6) Assisting: establish a strategy for family support and caring to reduce the stress and worries of nurses. é¢å°å…¨çƒæ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žçˆ†ç™¼å°ç£è­·ç†äººå“¡ä¹‹å£“åŠ›ã€å¿ƒç†å›°æ“¾èˆ‡ç·©è§£æ–¹å¼æŽ¢è¨Ž. 2019å¹´åº•æ–°åž‹å† ç‹€ç—…æ¯’ç–¾ç—…ï¼ˆCOVID-19ï¼‰åœ¨å…¨çƒçˆ†ç™¼ï¼Œç–«æƒ…æœŸé–“åŸ·æ¥­è­·ç†å¸«éœ€é¢è‡¨è«¸å¤šå£“åŠ›èˆ‡æ“”æ†‚ï¼Œé€™å°‡å°è­·ç†äººå“¡çš„å¿ƒç†å¥åº·ç”¢ç”Ÿç«‹å³æ€§èˆ‡æŒä¹…æ€§çš„é‡å¤§å½±éŸ¿ã€‚. æŽ¢è¨Žè­·ç†äººå“¡æ–¼COVID-19ç–«æƒ…ä¸‹çš„å£“åŠ›ã€å¿ƒç†å›°æ“¾èˆ‡ç·©è§£æ–¹å¼ã€‚. æ­¤æ©«æ–·å¼ç ”ç©¶æŽ¡ç·šä¸Šå•å·å¡«ç­”ï¼Œå•å·å«æ‹¬å››éƒ¨åˆ†ï¼šåŸºæœ¬è³‡æ–™ã€è­·ç†äººå“¡æ–¼COVID-19æœŸé–“çš„å£“åŠ›ã€å¿ƒç†å›°æ“¾ã€èˆ‡ç·©è§£å£“åŠ›æ–¹å¼èª¿æŸ¥ã€‚ä»¥æ–¹ä¾¿å–æ¨£æ–¹æ³•ï¼Œç²å…¨å°å„ç´šé†«é™¢å…±469ä½åŸ·æ¥­è­·ç†å¸«åƒèˆ‡å¡«ç­”ã€‚.

"[Intensive Care During a Global Epidemic]","The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly increasing the number of patients who are critically ill with this disease, with the related rate of mortality expected to peak in 2020 (Alhazzani et al., 2020). As severe acute respiratory syndrome is the major cause of mortality after COVID-19 infection, patients with COVID-19 who are prone to severe acute respiratory problems may require mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Ongoing advances in intensive care medicine are continuing to improve survival in critically ill patients (Kaukonen, Bailey, Suzuki, Pilcher, &amp; Bellomo, 2014). However, intensive care unit (ICU) survivors may experience complications and problems related to their disease and treatment such as critical illness polyneuropathy, critical illness myopathy, and post intensive care syndrome (PICS; Alhazzani et al., 2020). Harvey (2012) reported that 85%-95% of ICU patients have ICU-acquired weakness after ICU discharge and 74% of ICU patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have cognitive impairment after ICU discharge. Physical disabilities, cognitive impairment, and mental or psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder) after ICU discharge may be symptoms of PICS, and may continue to affect surviving patients for several years after ICU discharge (Elliott et al., 2014; Held &amp; Moss, 2019; Jackson et al., 2014; Jubran et al., 2010). Efforts to prevent and treat COVID-19 in Taiwan have proven more effective compared to most other places in the world. In addition to the low number of diagnosed cases, the mortality rate (seven of 440 confirmed cases) in Taiwan has been significantly lower than in most other countries (Taiwan Centers for Disease Control, ROC, 2020, May 14). However, post-discharge care for ICU survivors, especially those hospitalized after a sudden onset of severe disease symptoms and then discharged after a long ICU stay or after receiving mechanical ventilation, require specialized care to minimize PICS. Nurses are responsible not only for treating patients with the disease but also for preventing the further spread of disease. Therefore, providing continued care to patients discharged from the ICU is essential. Specifically, interventions to avoid PICS must be implemented rapidly by multidisciplinary medical teams during and immediately after ICU discharge. å…¨çƒæµè¡Œç–«æƒ…ä¸‹çš„é‡ç—‡åŠ è­·ç…§è­·. éš¨è‘—æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žï¼ˆCOVID-19ï¼‰ç–«æƒ…æ¼«å»¶ï¼Œé™¤äº†é«˜æ­»äº¡çŽ‡å¤–ï¼Œå…¨çƒé‡ç—‡ç—…äººæ–¼ä»Šå¹´ä¾†åˆ°ä¸€å€‹é«˜å³°ï¼ˆAlhazzani et al., 2020ï¼‰ã€‚æ–°åž‹åš´é‡æ€¥æ€§å‘¼å¸ç³»çµ±ç—‡å€™ç¾¤æ˜¯å°Žè‡´COVID-19è¿…é€Ÿè”“å»¶çš„ç–¾ç—…çš„åŽŸå› ï¼Œå› æ­¤ï¼Œç—…äººå®¹æ˜“å‡ºç¾åš´é‡æ€¥æ€§å‘¼å¸ç³»çµ±çš„å•é¡Œå°Žè‡´å¤šæ•¸æŸ“ç—…çš„ç—…äººéœ€è¦é€²ä½åŠ è­·ç—…æˆ¿ï¼ˆintensive care unit, ICUï¼‰ï¼Œä¸¦ä½¿ç”¨å‘¼å¸å™¨æˆ–è‘‰å…‹è†œï¼ˆECMOï¼‰æ²»ç™‚ï¼ˆAlhazzani et al., 2020ï¼‰ã€‚ç”±æ–¼é‡ç—‡ç›£è­·é†«å­¸çš„é€²æ­¥ï¼Œé‡ç—…æ‚£è€…çš„å­˜æ´»çŽ‡ä¹Ÿé€å¹´æé«˜ï¼ˆKaukonen, Bailey, Suzuki, Pilcher, &amp; Bellomo, 2014ï¼‰ï¼Œé‡ç—‡åŠ è­·ç—…äººé™¤äº†é«˜æ­»äº¡çŽ‡å¤–ï¼Œç—…äººæ–¼åŠ è­·ç—…æˆ¿æœŸé–“å› ç‚ºç–¾ç—…èˆ‡æ²»ç™‚å¯èƒ½ç”¢ç”Ÿè«¸å¤šä½µç™¼ç—‡èˆ‡å•é¡Œï¼Œå¦‚åš´é‡çš„å‘¼å¸ç³»çµ±ç–¾ç—…å’ŒçºŒç™¼æ€§å¤±èƒ½ç­‰é‡ç—‡åŠ è­·æ²»ç™‚çš„å¾Œæžœï¼ŒåŒ…æ‹¬é‡ç—‡å¤šç™¼æ€§ç¥žç¶“ç—…è®Šï¼ˆcritical illness polyneuropathyï¼‰å’Œé‡ç—…åŠ è­·å¾Œè‚Œç—…è®Šï¼ˆcritical illness myopathyï¼‰å’Œé‡ç—‡åŠ è­·å¾Œç—‡å€™ç¾¤ï¼ˆpost-intensive care syndrome, PICS; Alhazzani et al., 2020ï¼‰ã€‚Harveyï¼ˆ2012ï¼‰ç ”ç©¶ç™¼ç¾ï¼Œé‡ç—‡ç—…äººèº«é«”æ–¹é¢å•é¡ŒåŒ…æ‹¬ï¼šé‡ç—‡ç³»çµ±æ€§ä¹åŠ›ï¼ˆ85%â€“95%ï¼‰ï¼Œ74%è¢«è¨ºæ–·ç‚ºæ€¥æ€§å‘¼å¸çª˜è¿«å¾µå€™ç¾¤ï¼ˆacute respiratory distress syndromeï¼‰çš„ICUå­˜æ´»è€…æœ‰èªçŸ¥éšœç¤™ï¼Œä¸”é€™äº›å•é¡Œå¯èƒ½æŒçºŒåˆ°å‡ºé™¢å¾Œä»æœ‰èªçŸ¥ï¼Œç²¾ç¥žå’Œï¼æˆ–èº«é«”æ®˜ç–¾ï¼Œæ˜“å°Žè‡´æƒ…ç·’å¿ƒç†å›°æ“¾ï¼ˆå¦‚ï¼šç„¦æ…®ã€æ†‚é¬±å’Œå‰µå‚·å£“åŠ›éšœç¤™ï¼‰ï¼Œçµ±ç¨±ç‚ºPICSï¼Œä¸”ç›¸é—œå•é¡Œå¯èƒ½æŒçºŒå½±éŸ¿å­˜æ´»ç—…äººè‡³å‡ºé™¢å¾Œå¤šå¹´ï¼ˆElliott et al., 2014; Held &amp; Moss, 2019; Jackson et al., 2014ï¼‰ã€‚å°ç£æ–¼æœ¬æ¬¡COVID-19çš„é˜²ç–«èˆ‡æ²»ç™‚æˆæžœä¸–ç•Œæœ‰ç›®å…±ç¹ï¼Œé™¤äº†èˆ‡å…¨çƒå„åœ‹ç›¸è¼ƒçš„ä½Žç¢ºè¨ºäººæ•¸å¤–ï¼Œæ­»äº¡äººæ•¸ä¹Ÿæ¥µä½Žï¼ˆ440ä½ç¢ºè¨ºå€‹æ¡ˆåƒ…7ä½æ­»äº¡ï¼Œç–¾ç—…ç®¡åˆ¶ç½²ï¼Œ2020ï¼Œ5æœˆ14æ—¥ï¼‰ï¼Œç„¶è€Œå°æ–¼ç¢ºè¨ºé‡ç—‡ç—…äººçš„å‡ºé™¢å¾Œç…§è­·èˆ‡é—œæ‡·ä»ä¸å¯å¿½è¦–ï¼Œå°¤å…¶é‡å°ICUä½é™¢æœŸè¼ƒé•·ä¸”æœ‰ä½¿ç”¨å‘¼å¸å™¨è€…ï¼Œé¿å…é€™äº›çªç™¼é‡ç—‡å­˜æ´»çš„ç—…äººç”¢ç”ŸPICSå•é¡Œã€‚è­·ç†å°ˆæ¥­åœ¨æœ¬æ¬¡ç–«æƒ…é é˜²ã€æ²»ç™‚éŽç¨‹ä¸­ä¹Ÿæ‰¿æ“”è‘—å°ˆæ¥­çš„è²¬ä»»ï¼Œå› æ­¤åœ¨å‡ºé™¢ç—…äººçš„æŒçºŒé—œæ‡·äº¦æ‰®æ¼”ä¸€å€‹é‡è¦è§’è‰²ï¼Œåœ¨ç—…äººæ–¼é‡ç—‡ICUä½é™¢éŽç¨‹ä¸­é—œæ³¨ç—…äººå¯èƒ½å‡ºç¾çš„å•é¡ŒåŠæ—©ä»‹å…¥è™•ç½®ï¼Œä¸¦åƒèˆ‡è·¨é†«ç™‚å°ˆæ¥­åœ˜éšŠå…±åŒä»¥é¿å…é€™äº›é‡ç—‡å­˜æ´»è€…ç”¢ç”ŸPICSã€‚.","Lin","https://doi.org/10.6224/JN.202006_67(3).01","20200608","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Taiwan","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A New Drug-Drug Interaction Between Hydroxychloroquine and Metformin? A Signal Detection Study","Hydroxychloroquine was recently promoted in patients infected with COVID-19 infection. A recent experimental study has suggested an increased toxicity of hydroxychloroquine in association with metformin in mice. The present study was undertaken to investigate the reality of this putative drug-drug interaction between hydroxychloroquine and metformin using pharmacovigilance data. Using VigiBase<sup>Â®</sup>, the WHO pharmacovigilance database, we performed a disproportionality analysis (case/non-case study). Cases were reports of fatal outcomes with the drugs of interest and non-cases were all other reports for these drugs registered between 1Â January 2000 and 31Â December 2019. Data with hydroxychloroquine (or metformin) alone were compared with the association hydroxychloroquineâ€‰+â€‰metformin. Results are reported as ROR (reporting odds ratio) with their 95% confidence interval. Of the 10,771 Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) involving hydroxychloroquine, 52 were recorded as 'fatal outcomes'. In comparison with hydroxychloroquine alone, hydroxychloroquineâ€‰+â€‰metformin was associated with an ROR value of 57.7 (23.9-139.3). In comparison with metformin alone, hydroxychloroquineâ€‰+â€‰metformin was associated with an ROR value of 6.0 (2.6-13.8). Our study identified a signal for the association hydroxychloroquineâ€‰+â€‰metformin that appears to be more at risk of fatal outcomes (particularly by completed suicides) than one of the two drugs when given alone.","Montastruc, Toutain","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-00955-y","20200702","Adult; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Interactions; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Hypoglycemic Agents; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pharmacovigilance; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 Outbreak in Malaysia","In 2020 a significant threat to public health emerged. The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic outbreak emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China and spread to the rest of the world. This disease was named COVID-19 by World Health Organization. To date (17<sup>th</sup> April 2020) a total of 2,230,439 cases of COVID-19; 150,810 cases of deaths and 564,210 recovered cases have been reported worldwide. In this review the SARS-CoV-2 morphology, pathogenic mechanism, similarities and differences between SARS-CoV and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome, transmission mode, diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures were investigated. The outbreak of COVID-19 from a Malaysian perspective was explored and mental health care during the COVID-19 outbreak was explored. To date, there is no vaccine or no specific treatment for COVID-19. Therefore, preventive measures are very important to prevent and control the rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

For medical schools, this has manifested as examination and curricular restructuring as well as significant changes to clinical attachments. With the available evidence suggesting that medical students' mental health status is already poorer than that of the general population, with academic stress being a chief predictor, such changes are likely to have a significant effect on these students. In addition, there is an assumption that these students are an available resource in terms of volunteerism during a crisis. This conjecture should be questioned; however, as those engaging in such work without sufficient preparation are susceptible to moral trauma and adverse health outcomes. This, in conjunction with the likelihood of future pandemics, highlights the need for 'pandemic preparedness' to be embedded in the medical curriculum.","O'Byrne, Gavin, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106353","20200722","education; education/programs; emergency medicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Using Internet-Based Psychological Measurement to Capture the Deteriorating Community Mental Health Profile During COVID-19: Observational Study","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is expected to have widespread and pervasive implications for mental health in terms of deteriorating outcomes and increased health service use, leading to calls for empirical research on mental health during the pandemic. Internet-based psychological measurement can play an important role in collecting imperative data, assisting to guide evidence-based decision making in practice and policy, and subsequently facilitating immediate reporting of measurement results to participants. The aim of this study is to use an internet-based mental health measurement platform to compare the mental health profile of community members during COVID-19 with community members assessed before the pandemic. This study uses an internet-based self-assessment tool to collect data on psychological distress, mental well-being, and resilience in community cohorts during (n=673) and prior to the pandemic (two cohorts, n=1264 and n=340). Our findings demonstrate significantly worse outcomes on all mental health measures for participants measured during COVID-19 compared to those measured before (P&lt;.001 for all outcomes, effect sizes ranging between Cohen d=0.32 to Cohen d=0.81. Participants who demonstrated problematic scores for at least one of the mental health outcomes increased from 58% (n=197/340) before COVID-19 to 79% (n=532/673) during COVID-19, leading to only 21% (n=141) of measured participants displaying good mental health during the pandemic. The results clearly demonstrate deterioration in mental health outcomes during COVID-19. Although further research is needed, our findings support the serious mental health implications of the pandemic and highlight the utility of internet-based data collection tools in providing evidence to innovate and strengthen practice and policy during and after the pandemic.","van Agteren, Bartholomaeus, Fassnacht, Iasiello, Ali, Lo, Kyrios","https://doi.org/10.2196/20696","20200624","COVID-19; internet; mental health; pandemic; positive mental health; psychological distress; psychological measurement; resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19-Related Information Sources and the Relationship With Confidence in People Coping with COVID-19: Facebook Survey Study in Taiwan","People obtain information on the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from the internet and other sources. Understanding the factors related to such information sources aids health professionals in educating individuals. This study used data collected from the online survey study on COVID-19 in Taiwan to examine what major COVID-19 information sources are available and which sources are significantly related to the self-confidence of people in coping with COVID-19 in Taiwan. A total of 1904 participants (1270 non-health-care workers and 634 health care workers) were recruited from the Facebook advertisement. Their major sources of information about COVID-19, the relationships between the sources and demographic factors, and the relationships between the sources and the self-confidence in coping with COVID-19 were surveyed. Most Taiwanese people relied on the internet for COVID-19 information. Many respondents also used a variety of sources of information on COVID-19; such variety was associated with sex, age, and the level of worry toward COVID-19, as well as if one was a health care worker. For health care workers, the use of formal lessons as an information source was significantly associated with better self-confidence in coping with COVID-19. The significant association between receiving information from more sources and greater self-confidence was found only in health care workers but not in non-health-care workers. Medical professionals should consider subgroups of the population when establishing various means to deliver information on COVID-19.","Wang, Lu, Ko, Chen, Li, Chang, Yen","https://doi.org/10.2196/20021","20200617","COVID-19; Facebook; confidence; coping; information; internet; mental health; online health information; social media; survey; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

It presents in further detail the projects of the first theme, in particular the development of and initial data on the Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS), a brief instrument designed to screen for the wide range of potential outcomes of trauma. English language data and ongoing studies in several languages provide a first indication that the GPS is a feasible, reliable and valid tool, a tool that may be very useful in the current pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Further multi-language and cross-cultural validation is needed. Since the start of the GC-TS, new themes have been introduced to focus on in the coming years: a) Forcibly displaced persons, b) Global prevalence of stress and trauma related disorders, c) Socio-emotional development across cultures, and d) Collaborating to make traumatic stress research data &quot;FAIR&quot;.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and cancer care: Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists survey report","The covid-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented professional and personal challenges for the oncology community. Under the auspices of the Canadian Association of Medical Oncologists, we conducted an online national survey to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the medical oncology community in Canada. An English-language multiple-choice survey, including questions about demographics, covid-19 risk, use of personal protective equipment (ppe), personal challenges, and chemotherapy management was distributed to Canadian medical oncologists. The survey was open from 30 March to 4 April 2020, and attracted 159 responses. More than 70% of medical oncologists expressed moderate-to-extreme concern about personally contracting covid-19 and about family members or patients (or both) contracting covid-19 from them. Despite that high level of concern, considerable variability in the use of ppe in direct cancer care was reported at the time of this survey, with 33% of respondents indicating no routine ppe use at their institutions and 69% indicating uncertainty about access to adequate ppe. Of the respondents, 54% were experiencing feelings of nervousness or anxiety on most days, and 52% were having feelings of depression or hopelessness on at least some days. Concern about aging parents or family and individual wellness represented the top personal challenges identified. The management of cancer patients has been affected, with adoption of telemedicine reported by 82% of respondents, and cessation of clinical trial accrual reported by 54%. The 3 factors deemed most important for treatment decision-making wereâ– cancer prognosis and anticipated benefit from treatment,â– risk of treatment toxicity during scarce health care access, andâ– patient risk of contracting covid-19. This report describes the results of the first national survey assessing the impact of the covid-19 on Canadian medical oncologists and how they deliver systemic anticancer therapies. We hope that these data will provide a framework to address the challenges identified.","Gill, Hao, Hirte, Campbell, Colwell","https://doi.org/10.3747/co.27.6643","20200617","camo; covid-19; medical oncology; surveys; Anxiety; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Medical Oncology; Neoplasms; Oncologists; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health outcomes of the CoViD-19 pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (CoViD-19) caused by the novel Coronavirus strain SARS-CoV-2 is currently a pandemic. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared that the CoViD-19 outbreak is a public health emergency of international concern. The virus has already had a direct impact on the physical health of million people, and besides, it is supposed to pose a mental health threat of great magnitude globally. This review aims at synthesizing mounting evidence concerning the immediate psychological responses during the initial stage of the CoViD-19 pandemic among the general population, the health-care workers, and clinical populations. Experts point out the need to pay specific attention to other groups at risk of further distress that may need tailored interventions. Providing psychological first aid is an essential care component for populations that have been victims of emergencies and disasters, before, during and after the event. With the aim of dealing better with the urgent psychological problems of people involved in the CoViD-19 pandemic, a new psychological crisis intervention model is needed. Given the recommendation to minimize face-to-face interaction, online mental health services have been widely adopted in China and are urged in other countries.","Talevi, Socci, Carai, Carnaghi, Faleri, Trebbi, di Bernardo, Capelli, Pacitti","https://doi.org/10.1708/3382.33569","20200611","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Crisis Intervention; Emergencies; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Psychopharmacotherapy during the COVID-19 pandemic]","In view of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, patient care, including that of psychiatric patients, is facing unprecedented challenges. Treatment strategies for mental illness include psychotherapy and psychopharmacological interventions. The latter are associated with aÂ multitude of adverse drug reactions (ADR); however, they may currently represent the preferred treatment due to restrictions regarding patient care (i.e. social distancing). Direct contact to patients may have to be reduced in favor of telephone calls or video conferences, so that new techniques in diagnosing and treating patients have to be established to guarantee patient safety. Patients should be extensively informed about relevant ADRs and physicians should actively ask patients about the timely recognition of ADRs. The use of psychotropic drugs may lead to an increased risk of developing ADRs, which are considered to be particularly unfavorable if they occur simultaneously with an acute infection or may even lead to an increased risk of infection. These include respiratory depression, agranulocytosis, intoxication by inhibition of metabolizing enzymes and venous thromboembolism, each of which may be associated with potentially fatal consequences; however, physicians should simultaneously ensure adequate efficacy of treatment, since the ongoing crisis may lead to aÂ worsening of preexisting mental illnesses and to aÂ surge in first onset of psychiatric disorders.","Seifert, Heck, Eckermann, Singer, Bleich, Grohmann, Toto","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00115-020-00939-4","20200708","Adverse drug reactions (ADR); Drug safety; Infection; Psychiatry; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2); Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotherapy; Psychotropic Drugs","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Adolescents' Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health","Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Oosterhoff, Palmer, Wilson, Shook","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004","20200605","Anxiety; Belongingness; Burdensomeness; COVID-19; Depression; Motivation; Social distancing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Analysis of qualitative answers, however, showed that about 30% of patients had an insufficient level of knowledge, which was not associated with educational level, cognitive disorders, or depression. Changes in behaviour were reported by 73 patients (99% performed at least one specific preventive behavior, and 86.9% have reduced social contacts and stayed home). A closer analysis of qualitative answers showed that 27.3% of patients continued to meet relatives face-to-face almost daily. Anxiety and worries about the current situation were reported by 58.6% of patients; 31.3% complained about a decrease in their mobility since the beginning of the restrictions, mainly because of worsening of PD and because regular therapies (e.g., physiotherapy) were canceled. <b>Conclusions</b>: About 30% of PD patients are nonadherent to preventive measures.

"Coping with COVID-19: Exposure to COVID-19 and Negative Impact on Livelihood Predict Elevated Mental Health Problems in Chinese Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic might lead to more mental health problems. However, few studies have examined sleep problems, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms among the general adult population during the COVID-19 outbreak, and little is known about coping behaviors. This survey was conducted online in China from February 1st to February 10th, 2020. Quota sampling was used to recruit 2993 Chinese citizens aged â‰¥18 years old. Mental health problems were assessed with the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) Checklist for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression inventory, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Exposure to COVID-19 was measured with questions about residence at outbreak, personal exposure, media exposure, and impact on livelihood. General coping style was measured by the brief Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ). Respondents were also asked 12 additional questions about COVID-19 specific coping behaviors. Direct exposure to COVID-19 instead of the specific location of (temporary) residence within or outside the epicenter (Wuhan) of the pandemic seems important (standardized beta: 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.02-0.09). Less mental health problems were also associated with less intense exposure through the media (standardized beta: -0.07, 95% CI: -0.10--0.03). Perceived negative impact of the pandemic on livelihood showed a large effect size in predicting mental health problems (standardized beta: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.10-0.19). More use of cognitive and prosocial coping behaviors were associated with less mental health problems (standardized beta: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.34--0.27). Our study suggests that the mental health consequences of the lockdown impact on livelihood should not be underestimated. Building on cognitive coping behaviors reappraisal or cognitive behavioral treatments may be most promising.","Guo, Feng, Wang, van IJzendoorn","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17113857","20200609","COVID-19; Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms (PTSS); depression; insomnia; mental health; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep Wake Disorders; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences: Systematic review of the current evidence","During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002-2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (pÂ =Â 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19. Research evaluating the direct neuropsychiatric consequences and the indirect effects on mental health is highly needed to improve treatment, mental health care planning and for preventive measures during potential subsequent pandemics.","Vindegaard, Benros","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.048","20200704","COVID-19; Mental health; Mental health disorders; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is considered particularly at risk of disease transmission due to aerosol generation during surgical interventions, patient proximity and operating environment. On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home. There were 44 cases of facial fractures with a tendency for conservative treatment. 19 cases were related to domestic violence or self-harm. Of the 216 dental related emergencies, 68% could have been managed in the primary care setting. A quarter of all emergency patients were satisfactorily managed by remote consultations.

"Emergency mental health legislation in response to the Covid-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic in Ireland: Urgency, necessity and proportionality","Many countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, emergency mental health legislation in response to the global pandemic of Covid-19 (coronavirus). In Ireland, the Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act, 2020 amends the Mental Health Act 2001 to permit the Mental Health Commission to request an independent psychiatric report about an involuntary patient from any consultant psychiatrist who is not treating the patient (and not just those on its designated panel). This independent examination may occur 'in person', 'by other appropriate means', or even, 'due to the exigencies of the public health emergency', not occur at all, once this is explained in the resultant report. The 2020 Act acknowledges that 'the exigencies of the public health emergency' might hamper the independent psychiatrist's work and requires a written report from the patient's treating psychiatrist 'no earlier than the day before' the tribunal, in lieu of the psychiatrist physically attending a tribunal hearing, although, if possible, they will attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. The 2020 Act permits the Mental Health Commission to, if necessary, appoint tribunals 'consisting of one member who shall be a practising barrister or solicitor'. Such a tribunal shall, if possible, consult with a consultant psychiatrist if the reports from the independent psychiatrist and treating psychiatrist conflict or if it is otherwise 'necessary in the interest of the patient'. A tribunal can extend an involuntary order by a second period of 14Â days 'of its own motion if the tribunal, having due regard to the interest of the patient, is satisfied that it is necessary'. Tribunals for current involuntary patients will be prioritised over retrospective tribunals for discharged patients; a tribunal can direct a witness to provide 'a written statement' rather than attending; and the patient can make written representation to the tribunal instead of physically attending a tribunal hearing, although they may attend (i.e. phone in to) a tribunal held by conference call. Psycho-surgery for involuntary patients is banned. While it is clear that revisions are urgent and necessary in light of Covid-19, the proportionality of these changes will depend on how, and the extent to which, they are used in practice. With good communication, efficient team-working and close adherence to professional codes of practice and ethics, it is hoped that these amendments will result in a review system that is as reasonable, robust and reassuring as the current, highly unusual circumstances permit.","Kelly","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101564","20200615","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Human rights; Ireland; Mental disorder; Mental health legislation; Advisory Committees; Betacoronavirus; Commitment of Mentally Ill; Coronavirus Infections; Decision Making; Emergency Service, Hospital; Humans; Ireland; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prior and novel coronaviruses, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and human reproduction: what is known?","To summarize current understanding of the effects of novel and prior coronaviruses on human reproduction, specifically male and female gametes, and in pregnancy. Review of English publications in PubMed and Embase to April 6,Â 2020. Articles were screened for reports including coronavirus, reproduction, pathophysiology, and pregnancy. None. Reproductive outcomes, effects on gametes, pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal complications. Seventy-nine reports formed the basis of the review. Coronavirus binding to cells involves the S1 domain of the spike protein to receptors present in reproductive tissues, including angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), CD26, Ezrin, and cyclophilins. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) may cause severe orchitis leading to germ cell destruction in males. Reports indicate decreased sperm concentration and motility for 72-90 days following Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Gonadotropin-dependent expression of ACE2 was found in human ovaries, but it is unclear whether SARS-Coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) adversely affects female gametogenesis. Evidence suggests that COVID-19 infection has a lower maternal case fatality rate than SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), but anecdotal reports suggest that infected, asymptomatic women may develop respiratory symptoms postpartum. Coronavirus Disease 2019 infections in pregnancy are associated with preterm delivery. Postpartum neonatal transmission from mother to child has been reported. Coronavirus Disease 2019 infection may affect adversely some pregnant women and their offspring.

"Psychological intervention on COVID-19: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 is novel coronavirus infection in 2019. Many reports suggested that psychological intervention is playing a positive role in COVID-19 treatment, but there is no high-quality evidence to prove its effects. This paper reports the protocol of a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify effectiveness of psychological intervention during the treatment of COVID-19. The following electronic databases will be used by 2 independent reviewers: Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Scientific Journal Database, Wan fang Database, ClinicalTrials, WHO Trials, and Chinese Clinical Trial Registry. The randomised controlled trials of psychological intervention on COVID-19 will be searched in the databases by 2 researchers independently. Clinical recovery time and effective rate will be assessed as the primary outcomes. Changes of patients physical condition (1. Time until COVID-19 RT-PCR negative in upper respiratory tract specimen; 2. Time until cough reported as mild or absent; 3. Time until dyspnea reported as mild or absent; 4. Frequency of requiring supplemental oxygen or non-invasive ventilation; 5. Frequency of requiring respiratory; 6. Incidence of severe cases; 7. Proportion of re-hospitalization or admission to ICU; 8. All-cause mortality; 9. Frequency of seriously adverse events) and changes of psychological condition (such as: SRQ-20, PHQ-9, GAD-7, Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale) will be assessed as the secondary outcomes. For dichotomous outcomes, such as effective rate, data will be expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences (WMD) or standardized mean differences (SMD) will be calculated. Fixed effect model will be used for evaluating efficiency. Considering clinical heterogeneity, random effect model will be used for continuous outcomes. Relevant studies will be used to evaluate whether psychological intervention is effective for COVID-19. This study will provide reliable evidence for psychological intervention on COVID-19.

"Development and Clinical Evaluation of a Web-Based Upper Limb Home Rehabilitation System Using a Smartwatch and Machine Learning Model for Chronic Stroke Survivors: Prospective Comparative Study","Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have shown the feasibility of remote physical therapy at home. In particular, the current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the need and opportunity of internet-based wearable technology in future health care systems. Previous research has shown the feasibility of human activity recognition technologies for monitoring rehabilitation activities in home environments; however, few comprehensive studies ranging from development to clinical evaluation exist. This study aimed to (1) develop a home-based rehabilitation (HBR) system that can recognize and record the type and frequency of rehabilitation exercises conducted by the user using a smartwatch and smartphone app equipped with a machine learning (ML) algorithm and (2) evaluate the efficacy of the home-based rehabilitation system through a prospective comparative study with chronic stroke survivors. The HBR system involves an off-the-shelf smartwatch, a smartphone, and custom-developed apps. A convolutional neural network was used to train the ML algorithm for detecting home exercises. To determine the most accurate way for detecting the type of home exercise, we compared accuracy results with the data sets of personal or total data and accelerometer, gyroscope, or accelerometer combined with gyroscope data. From March 2018 to February 2019, we conducted a clinical study with two groups of stroke survivors. In total, 17 and 6 participants were enrolled for statistical analysis in the HBR group and control group, respectively. To measure clinical outcomes, we performed the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity, grip power test, Beck Depression Inventory, and range of motion (ROM) assessment of the shoulder joint at 0, 6, and 12 months, and at a follow-up assessment 6 weeks after retrieving the HBR system. The ML model created with personal data involving accelerometer combined with gyroscope data (5590/5601, 99.80%) was the most accurate compared with accelerometer (5496/5601, 98.13%) or gyroscope data (5381/5601, 96.07%). In the comparative study, the drop-out rates in the control and HBR groups were 40% (4/10) and 22% (5/22) at 12 weeks and 100% (10/10) and 45% (10/22) at 18 weeks, respectively. The HBR group (n=17) showed a significant improvement in the mean WMFT score (P=.02) and ROM of flexion (P=.004) and internal rotation (P=.001). The control group (n=6) showed a significant change only in shoulder internal rotation (P=.03). This study found that a home care system using a commercial smartwatch and ML model can facilitate participation in home training and improve the functional score of the WMFT and shoulder ROM of flexion and internal rotation in the treatment of patients with chronic stroke. This strategy can possibly be a cost-effective tool for the home care treatment of stroke survivors in the future.

"What lies ahead: Elevated concerns for the ongoing suicide pandemic","The genesis and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant health concerns amid societies that were ill-equipped for such a formidable opponent. The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated systemic health disparities and weaknesses within our health care and political systems. With aggressive but necessary interventions to thwart the instantaneous reproduction number, we have simultaneously introduced risk factors for new and exacerbated mental health concerns. Suicide, an ongoing pandemic whose rates are higher than they have been in the past 50 years, is one of these concerns as we navigate COVID-19 deaths and fears surrounding its spread. This article aims to briefly describe in retrospect some of the historical pandemics and their downstream consequences as well as present what may lie ahead in terms of anxiety, depression, and suicidal behaviors. This applies not only to frontline health care workers but also the public at large, who may very well experience long-term stressor- and trauma-related consequences through ongoing exposure to a virus that is not only potentially fatal but may have taken the lives of loved ones.

"Rural-urban mental health disparities in the United States during COVID-19","The United States has more confirmed deaths from coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) than any other country in the world. State governors made decisions around social distancing in their jurisdictions, which caused schools and businesses to close. Those with broadband access continued a sense or normalcy in their lives. However, for the more than 20 million people who do not have broadband access, a different set of barriers has been experienced. These challenges are especially prominent in rural communities throughout various states. The present commentary addresses how health disparities for preexisting conditions place rural residents at greater risk for morbidity during COVID-19. Reasons for physical and mental health disparities, such as limited access to hospitals or specialty providers (e.g., psychiatrists), are described. Whereas telehealth is promoted as a way to meet health access needs, especially during a pandemic, this luxury is not readily available for all U.S. residents. Recent actions brought about by the government (e.g., the CARES Act) have tried to address the rural-urban gap in telehealth, but more is needed.

"The social psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical staff in China: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 outbreak required the significantly increased working time and intensity for health professionals in China, which may cause stress signs. From March 2-13 of 2020, 4,618 health professionals in China were included in an anonymous, self-rated online survey regarding their concerns on exposure to the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaires consisted of five parts: basic demographic information and epidemiological exposure; occupational and psychological impact; concerns during the episode; coping strategies; and the Huaxi Emotional-Distress Index (HEI). About 24.2% of respondents experienced high levels of anxiety or/and depressive symptoms since the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who worried about their physical health and those who had COVID-19 infected friends or close relatives were more likely to have high HEI levels, than those without these characteristics. Further, family relationship was found to have an independent protective effect against high HEI levels. Their main concerns were that their families would not be cared for and that they would not be able to work properly. Compared to respondents with clear emotional problems, those with somewhat hidden emotional issues adopted more positive coping measures. About a quarter of medical staff experienced psychological problems during the pandemic of COVID-19. The psychological impact of stressful events was related to worrying about their physical health, having close COVID-19 infected acquaintances and family relationship issues. Therefore, the psychological supprot for medical staff fighting in the COVID-19 pandemic may be needed.","Dong, Ma, Hao, Shen, Liu, Gao, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.59","20200713","COVID-19; cross-sectional survey; medical staff; novel coronavirus; psychology; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Staff; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In the eating disorders group, increased restricting, binge eating, purging, and exercise behaviors were found. In the general population, both increased restricting and binge eating behaviors were reported; however, respondents reported less exercise relative to before the pandemic. The findings have important implications for providing greater monitoring and support for eating disorder patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 in four Chinese cities","In December 2019, there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China. The number of patients in China has risen to 31,000. We collected patient data from four Chinese cities (Hefei, Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Shenzhen) and described epidemiologic characteristics. As of 6 February 2020, we extracted data from 950 patients from the four cities. There were 477 (50.21%) males and 473 (49.79%) females of age (mean Â± SD) 45.64 Â± 15.59 years. Before contracting COVID-19, 299 patients had contact with Wuhan residents or contact with patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (31.47%).

"Dexmedetomidine and worsening hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19: A case report","Emergency department management of hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19 is riddled with uncertainty. The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.","Stockton, Kyle-Sidell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066","20200613",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic]","The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11Â million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees' access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000Â prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called &quot;UHSAs&quot; (which stands for &quot;unitÃ©s hospitaliÃ¨res spÃ©cialement amÃ©nagÃ©es&quot;, and can be translated as &quot;specially equipped hospital units&quot;). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of &quot;Covid units&quot;, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives' well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known &quot;revolving prison doors&quot; effect. The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.","Fovet, LancelevÃ©e, Eck, Scouflaire, BÃ©cache, Dandelot, Giravalli, Guillard, Horrach, Lacambre, Lefebvre, Moncany, Touitou, David, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002","20200713","Confinement; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Epidemic; Lockdown; Milieu pÃ©nitentiaire; Pandemic; PandÃ©mie; Prison; Psychiatrie; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-Cov-2; Ã‰pidÃ©mie; Adult; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Female; France; Health Care Surveys; Health Services Accessibility; Hospital Units; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Prisoners; Prisons; Psychiatric Department, Hospital; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The term &quot;physical distancing&quot; is recommended rather than &quot;social distancing&quot; during the COVID-19 pandemic for reducing feelings of rejection among people with mental health problems","As COVID-19 has plagued our world, the term &quot;social distancing&quot; has been widely used with the aim to encourage the general population to physically distance themselves from others in order to reduce the spread of the virus. However, this term can have unintended but detrimental effects, as it evokes negative feelings of being ignored, unwelcome, left alone with one's own fears, and even excluded from society. These feelings may be stronger in people with mental illnesses and in socio-economically disadvantaged groups, such as stigmatized minorities, migrants, and homeless persons [1], many of them also having high risk for suicidal behaviors [2]. Mental health disorders are pervasive worldwide; the global burden accounting for approximately 21.2-32.4% of years lived with disability-more than any other group of illnesses [3]. So, the vulnerable group of people with mental health disorders represents a considerable share of the total global population.","Wasserman, van der Gaag, Wise","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.60","20200617","Child; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Disabled Persons; Emotions; Female; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stereotyping; Terminology as Topic; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Editorial Perspective: Perils and promise for child and adolescent sleep and associated psychopathology during the COVID-19 pandemic","It is anticipated that the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and associated societal response will have wide-ranging impacts on youth development and mental health. Sleep is crucial for child and adolescent health and well-being, and the potential for sleep problems to emerge or worsen during and following the pandemic is high. This may be particularly true for children and adolescents who are at heightened risk for the onset of sleep and mental health disturbances and for those whom developmental changes impacting sleep are rapidly occurring. Youth with preexisting psychopathologies (including anxiety and depression) and neurodevelopmental conditions (including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and autism spectrum disorder) could be especially vulnerable to disturbed sleep during this period of change and uncertainty. It is thus imperative that sleep considerations be part of research and clinical initiatives aimed at understanding and mitigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in children and adolescents.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 quarantine measures in northeastern Italy on mothers in the immediate postpartum period","To explore whether quarantine measures and hospital containment policies among women giving birth in a COVID-19 &quot;hotspot&quot; area in northeastern Italy enhanced psycho-emotional distress in the immediate postpartum period. We designed a non-concurrent case-control study of mothers who gave birth during a COVID-19 quarantine period between March 8 and May 3, 2020 (COVID-19 study group), with an antecedent group of matched postpartum women (control group) who delivered in the same period in 2019.

In thisretrospective, multicenter study, the medical records of elderly patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hunan province, China, from January 21 to February 19, 2020 were reviewed. The characteristics of young-old patients and old-old patients were compared. Of the 105 elderly patientsconfirmed withCOVID-19, 81.0% were young-old patients, and 19.0% were old-old patients; 54.3% of elderly patients were females. Overall, 69.5% of elderly patients had underlying diseases, and the most common comorbidities included hypertension (43.8%), diabetes (25.7%), and cardiac disease (16.2%). Of the elderly patients, 22.9% were severe and 10.5% were critical severe cases. On admission, the most frequent symptoms in elderly patients included fever (66.7%), cough (64.8%), and fatigue (33.3%). Lymphopenia (31.4%), increased D-dimer (38.1%), depressed albumin (36.2%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (41.0%), and a high level of C-reactive protein (79.0%) were common among elderly patients with COVID-19. The median prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were longer in old-old patients than young-old patients (PT median 12.3 vs. 13.1 s, p = 0.007; APTT median 39.0 vs. 33.5 s, p = 0.045). Young-old patients showed fewer complications (14.1%) than old-old patients (40.0%; p = 0.0014) and fewer received invasive ventilator support (3.5 vs. 25.0%, p = 0.006). As of March 11, 2020, 85.7% of elderly patients had been discharged, 3 deaths had occurred, and 11.4% were still hospitalized. Elderly patients usually have chronic medical illness and are likely to have a severe or critically severe condition. They could show atypical symptoms without fever or cough and multiple organ dysfunction. Old-old patients tend to have more complications than young-old patients during hospitalization.

These important links to ecopsychological constructs of the extinction of experience, which indicates that loss of direct, personal contact with biodiversity (wildlife and the more visible elements of the natural world), might lead to emotional apathy and irresponsible behaviors toward the environment. The immune system is a useful early barometer of environmental effects and, by means of the microbiome, is a measure of the way in which our current experiences differ from our ancestral past. Although we would benefit from further research, efforts to increase direct, personal contact with biodiversity have clear benefits for multiple aspects of physical and mental health, the skin and gut microbiome, immune function, food choices, sleep, and physical activity and promote environmental responsibility.","Prescott","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anai.2020.05.025","20200701",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Maternal choline and respiratory coronavirus effects on fetal brain development","Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6-16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants' level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (â‰¥7.5Â mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (&lt;7.5Â mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels â‰¥7.5Â Î¼M, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.","Freedman, Hunter, Law, D'Alessandro, Noonan, Wyrwa, Camille Hoffman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019","20200622","Attention; Child development; Choline; Coronavirus; Phosphatidylcholine; Pregnancy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This provides challenges for the use of secondary prevention measures in patients with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of this Position Statement is to review the implications for effective delivery of secondary prevention strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced limitations for many patients to access standard health services such as visits to health care professionals, medications, imaging and blood tests as well as attendance at cardiac rehabilitation. In addition, the pandemic is having an impact on lifestyle habits and mental health. Taken together, this has the potential to adversely impact the ability of practitioners and patients to adhere to treatment guidelines for the prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events. Every effort should be made to deliver safe, ongoing access to health care professionals and the use of evidenced based therapies in individuals with CVD. An increase in use of a range of electronic health platforms has the potential to transform secondary prevention.

"Brainstem involvement and respiratory failure in COVID-19","Respiratory failure is the most worrisome problem of COVID-19. Patients may develop severe pneumonia requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and a significant proportion of them dies. It has been suggested that brainstem might play a role in severe respiratory failure of COVID-19 patients. We described three COVID-19 patients in ICU at Federico II Hospital in Naples that, although had recovered from pneumonia, could not be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation. Our clinical evaluation was consistent with an involvement of the brainstem and especially of respiratory centre thus possibly explaining the weaning failure in patients that were awake and had recovered from lung involvement. Our data, though limited, indicate that brainstem involvement may play a role in respiratory failure and perhaps in the high death rate of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, the weaning failure from mechanical ventilation due to central respiratory drive depression might underlie the unusual long stay in ICU reported for COVID-19 patients.","Manganelli, Vargas, Iovino, Iacovazzo, Santoro, Servillo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-020-04487-2","20200723","Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; brainstem involvement; respiratory failure","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

To provide the first snapshot of immediate impact of COVID-19 on Americans' stress, coping, and guideline adherence. Data were collected from an online workers' platform for survey research (Amazon's Mechanical Turk) from April 7 to 9, 2020. The current data represents the baseline of a longitudinal study. Best practices for ensuring high-quality data were employed. Individuals who are 18 years of age or older, living in the USA, and English-speaking were eligible for the study. Of 1086 unique responses, 1015 completed responses are included. Population-based. Exposure to and stressfulness of COVID-19 stressors, coping strategies, and adherence to CDC guidelines. The sample was 53.9% women (n = 547), with an average age of 38.9 years (SD = 13.50, range = 18-88), most of whom were White (n = 836, 82.4%), non-Hispanic (n = 929, 91.5%), and straight/heterosexual (n = 895, 88.2%); 40% were currently married (n = 407), and 21.6% (n = 219) were caregivers. About half (50.5%) endorsed having at least &quot;mostly&quot; enough money to meet their needs. Respondents' locations across the USA ranged from 18.5% in the Northeast to 37.8% in the South. The most commonly experienced stressors were reading/hearing about the severity and contagiousness of COVID-19, uncertainty about length of quarantine and social distancing requirements, and changes to social and daily personal care routines. Financial concerns were rated most stressful. Younger age, female gender, and caregiver status increased risk for stressor exposure and greater degree of stressfulness. The most frequently reported strategies to manage stress were distraction, active coping, and seeking emotional social support. CDC guideline adherence was generally high, but several key social distancing and hygiene behaviors showed suboptimal adherence, particularly for men and younger adults. Americans have high COVID-19 stress exposure and some demographic subgroups appear particularly vulnerable to stress effects. Subgroups less likely to adhere to CDC guidelines may benefit from targeted information campaigns. these findings may guide mental health interventions and inform policy-making regarding implications of specific public health measures.","Park, Russell, Fendrich, Finkelstein-Fox, Hutchison, Becker","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-020-05898-9","20200602",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives]","The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.","Conejero, Berrouiguet, Ducasse, Leboyer, Jardon, OliÃ©, Courtet","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001","20200713","COVID-19; Crise Ã©conomique; DÃ©connexion sociale; Economic crisis; PrÃ©vention; Social disconnection; Suicidal behavior; Suicidal vulnerability; Suicide; Suicide prevention; VulnÃ©rabilitÃ© suicidaire; Alcoholic Intoxication; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cost of Illness; Crisis Intervention; Economic Recession; France; Humans; Inflammation; Loneliness; Models, Neurological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotherapy; Psychotic Disorders; Quarantine; Renin-Angiotensin System; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Social Isolation; Stress, Psychological; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide, Attempted; Telemedicine; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological status and behavior changes of the public during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","A cluster of pneumonia cases were reported by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission, China in December 2019. A novel coronavirus was eventually identified, and became the COVID-19 epidemic that affected public health and life. We investigated the psychological status and behavior changes of the general public in China from January 30 to February 3, 2020. Respondents were recruited via social media (WeChat) and completed an online questionnaire. We used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, and Symptom Checklist-90 to evaluate psychological status. We also investigated respondents' behavior changes. Quantitative data were analyzed by t-tests or analysis of variance, and classified data were analyzed with chi-square tests. In total, 608 valid questionnaires were obtained. More respondents had state anxiety than trait anxiety (15.8% vs 4.0%). Depression was found among 27.1% of respondents and 7.7% had psychological abnormalities. About 10.1% of respondents suffered from phobia. Our analysis of the relationship between subgroup characteristics and psychological status showed that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced psychological status. Around 93.3% of respondents avoided going to public places and almost all respondents reduced Spring Festival-related activities. At least 70.9% of respondents chose to take three or more preventive measures to avoid infection. The three most commonly used prevention measures were making fewer trips outside and avoiding contact (98.0%), wearing a mask (83.7%), and hand hygiene (82.4%). We need to pay more attention to public psychological stress, especially among young people, as they are likely to experience anxiety, depression, and psychological abnormalities. Different psychological interventions could be formulated according to the psychological characteristics of different gender and age groups. The majority of respondents followed specific behaviors required by the authorities, but it will take time to observe the effects of these behaviors on the epidemic.","Liu, Luo, Li, Li, Hong, Chen, Xiao, Xia","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40249-020-00678-3","20200604","Anxiety; Behavior changes; COVID-19; Depression; Phobia; Psychological stress; Public psychological status; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Phobic Disorders; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Changes in Provision of Psychotherapy in the Early Weeks of the COVID-19 Lockdown in Austria","Reducing personal contacts is a central measure against the spreading of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This troubles mental health, but also mental health care as treatments usually take place in personal contact and switching to remote treatments might be necessary in times of COVID-19. The present study investigated the question how the provision of psychotherapy changed in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and whether there were differences between the four therapeutic orientations eligible in Austria (psychodynamic, humanistic, systemic, behavioral). Psychotherapists (<i>N</i> = 1547) completed an online survey. They entered their number of patients treated on average per week (in personal contact, via telephone, via Internet) in the early weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria as well as (retrospectively) in the months before. The number of patients treated on average per week in personal contact decreased (on average 81%; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), whereas the number of patients treated on average per week via telephone and via Internet increased (on average 979% and 1561%; both <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Yet, the decrease of psychotherapies through personal contact was not compensated for by increases of remote psychotherapies (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). No differences between the four therapeutic orientations emerged. Results imply an undersupply of psychotherapy in the COVID-19 lockdown and that further changes are necessary to cover the increased need for timely psychotherapy in times of COVID-19.","Probst, Stippl, Pieh","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17113815","20200617","COVID-19; Psychotherapy; Public Health; Austria; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotherapy; Retrospective Studies; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Age differences in COVID-19 risk perceptions and mental health:Evidence from a national US survey conducted in March 2020","Theories of aging posit that older adult age is associated with less negative emotions, but few studies have examined age differences at times of novel challenges. As COVID-19 spread in the United States, this study therefore aimed to examine age differences in risk perceptions, anxiety and depression. In March 2020, a nationally representative address-based sample of 6666 US adults assessed their perceived risk of getting COVID-19, dying if getting it, getting quarantined, losing their job (if currently working), and running out of money. They completed a mental health assessment for anxiety and depression. Demographic variables and pre-crisis depression diagnosis had previously been reported. In regression analyses controlling for demographic variables and survey date, older adult age was associated with perceiving larger risks of dying if getting COVID-19, but with perceiving less risk of getting COVID-19, getting quarantined, or running out of money, as well as less depression and anxiety. Findings held after additionally controlling for pre-crisis reports of depression diagnosis. With the exception of perceived infection-fatality risk, US adults who were relatively older appeared to have a more optimistic outlook and better mental health during the early stages of the pandemic. Interventions may be needed to help people of all ages maintain realistic perceptions of the risks, while also managing depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 crisis. Implications for risk communication and mental health interventions are discussed.","Bruine de Bruin","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa074","20200529","Risk perception; anxiety; depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Social support and mental health among health care workers during Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak: A moderated mediation model","During the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) all over the world, the mental health conditions of health care workers are of great importance to ensure the efficiency of rescue operations. The current study examined the effect of social support on mental health of health care workers and its underlying mechanisms regarding the mediating role of resilience and moderating role of age during the epidemic. Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were administrated among 1472 health care workers from Jiangsu Province, China during the peak period of COVID-19 outbreak. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the mediation effect of resilience on the relation between social support and mental health, whereas moderated mediation analysis was performed by Hayes PROCESS macro. The findings showed that resilience could partially mediate the effect of social support on mental health among health care workers. Age group moderated the indirect relationship between social support and mental health via resilience. Specifically, compared with younger health care workers, the association between resilience and mental health would be attenuated in the middle-aged workers. The results add knowledge to previous literature by uncovering the underlying mechanisms between social support and mental health. The present study has profound implications for mental health services for health care workers during the peak period of COVID-19.","Hou, Zhang, Cai, Song, Chen, Deng, Ni","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233831","20200604","China; Coronavirus Infections; Disaster Medicine; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Resilience, Psychological; Social Support","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Behavioral Health and Response for COVID-19","Research from financial stress, disasters, pandemics, and other extreme events, suggests that behavioral health will suffer, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Furthermore, these symptoms are likely to exacerbate alcohol or drug use, especially for those vulnerable to relapse. The nature of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and vast reach of the virus, leave many unknows for the repercussions on behavioral health, yet existing research suggests that behavioral health concerns should take a primary role in response to the pandemic. We propose a 4-step services system designed for implementation with a variety of different groups and reserves limited clinical services for the most extreme reactions. While we can expect symptoms to remit overtime, many will also have longer-term or more severe concerns. Behavioral health interventions will likely need to change overtime and different types of interventions should be considered for different target groups, such as for those who recover from COVID-19, health-care professionals, and essential personnel; and the general public either due to loss of loved ones or significant life disruption. The important thing is to have a systematic plan to support behavioral health and to engage citizens in prevention and doing their part in recovery by staying home and protecting others.","Hansel, Saltzman, Bordnick","https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2020.180","20200624","COVID-19; behavioral health; community mental health services; pandemics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the medico-legal and human rights of psychiatric patients","The COVID-19 pandemic has raised significant concerns for population mental health and the effective provision of mental health services in the light of increased demands and barriers to service delivery [1]. Particular attention is being directed toward the possible neuropsychiatric sequelae of both COVID-19 and of the stringent societal mitigation steps deployed by national governments, concerns that are informed by historical increases in the incidence of psychotic disorders following influenza pandemics [2]. However, so far there has been scant attention paid to other important areas of psychiatry during COVID-19, including medico-legal aspects and human rights. In this paper, we discuss the legal implications for psychiatry of the COVID-19 pandemic and report a novel situation in which psychiatric patients may experience diminution of their statutory protections. We believe that this represents a paradigm shift in psychiatric care and that the consideration of the fundamental rights of psychiatric patients as &quot;less important&quot; than infection control measures compel mental health professionals to &quot;advocate for â€¦ patients and their caregivers&quot; in this time of crisis [1].","Thome, Coogan, Simon, Fischer, Tucha, Faltraco, Marazziti, Butzer","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.58","20200611","Betacoronavirus; Civil Rights; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Health Personnel; Human Rights; Humans; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Mentally Ill Persons; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

People are likely to experience feelings as; worry about being infected or getting sick, increased self-blame, and helplessness. This study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and social support among Egyptian adults during the period of the pandemic. This is a cross-sectional observational study using an anonymous online questionnaire. The survey was conducted through a link shared on social networking sites.

"Social Media Data Analytics on Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Physical distancing during the coronavirus Covid-19 pandemic has brought telehealth to the forefront to keep up with patient care amidst an international crisis that is exhausting healthcare resources. Understanding and managing health-related concerns resulting from physical distancing measures are of utmost importance. To describe and analyze the volume, content, and geospatial distribution of tweets associated with telehealth during theÂ Covid-19 pandemic. We inquired Twitter public data to access tweets related to telehealth from March 30, 2020 to April 6, 2020. We analyzed tweets using natural language processing (NLP) and unsupervised learning methods. Clustering analysis was performed to classify tweets. Geographic tweet distribution was correlated with Covid-19 confirmed cases in the United States. All analyses were carried on the Google Cloud computing service &quot;Google Colab&quot; using Python libraries (Python Software Foundation). A total of 41,329 tweets containing the term &quot;telehealth&quot; were retrieved. The most common terms appearing alongside 'telehealth' were &quot;covid&quot;, &quot;health&quot;, &quot;care&quot;, &quot;services&quot;, &quot;patients&quot;, and &quot;pandemic&quot;. Mental health was the most common health-related topic that appeared in our search reflecting a high need for mental healthcare during the pandemic. Similarly, Medicare was the most common appearing health plan mirroring the accelerated access to telehealth and change in coverage policies. The geographic distribution of tweets related to telehealth and having a specific location within the United States (n=19,367) was significantly associated with the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in each state (p&lt;0.001). Social media activity is an accurate reflection of disease burden during the Covid-19 pandemic.

"Years of life lost due to the psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 mitigation strategies based on Swiss data","The pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has forced governments to implement strict social mitigation strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality from acute infections. These strategies, however, carry a significant risk for mental health, which can lead to increased short-term and long-term mortality and is currently not included in modeling the impact of the pandemic. We used years of life lost (YLL) as the main outcome measure, applied to Switzerland as an example. We focused on suicide, depression, alcohol use disorder, childhood trauma due to domestic violence, changes in marital status, and social isolation, as these are known to increase YLL in the context of imposed restriction in social contact and freedom of movement. We stipulated a minimum duration of mitigation of 3 months based on current public health plans. The study projects that the average person would suffer 0.205 YLL due to psychosocial consequence of COVID-19 mitigation measures. However, this loss would be entirely borne by 2.1% of the population, who will suffer an average of 9.79 YLL. The results presented here are likely to underestimate the true impact of the mitigation strategies on YLL. However, they highlight the need for public health models to expand their scope in order to provide better estimates of the risks and benefits of mitigation.","Moser, Glaus, Frangou, Schechter","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.56","20200623","Alcohol use disorder; COVID-19; depression; longevity; psychosocial stress; suicide; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Social Isolation; Switzerland; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Therefore, it is time to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The current population-based study aimed to evaluate the depression and anxiety of people in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents were randomly recruited and asked to complete a structured questionnaire, including the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7), the global rating of change scale and items related to COVID-19. Of the 500 respondents included in the study, 19% had depression (PHQ-9 score â‰¥ 10) and 14% had anxiety (GAD score â‰¥ 10). In addition, 25.4% reported that their mental health had deteriorated since the pandemic. Multiple logistic regression analysis found that not experiencing the SARS outbreak in 2003, being worried about being infected by COVID-19, being bothered by having not enough surgical masks and being bothered by not being able to work from home were associated with a poorer mental health status. Psychological support, such as brief, home-based psychological interventions, should be provided to citizens during the pandemic.","Choi, Hui, Wan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103740","20200608","COVID-19; Hong Kong; anxiety; depression; mental health; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health Problems during the COVID-19 Pandemics and the Mitigation Effects of Exercise: A Longitudinal Study of College Students in China","(1) Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health emergency that has caused worldwide concern. Vast resources have been allocated to control the pandemic and treat patients. However, little attention has been paid to the adverse impact on mental health or effective mitigation strategies to improve mental health. (2) Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the adverse impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on Chinese college students' mental health, understand the underlying mechanisms, and explore feasible mitigation strategies. (3) Methods: During the peak time of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we conducted longitudinal surveys of sixty-six college students. Structured questionnaires collected information on demographics, physical activity, negative emotions, sleep quality, and aggressiveness level. A mixed-effect model was used to evaluate associations between variables, and the mediating effect of sleep quality was further explored. A generalized additive model was used to determine the dose-response relationships between the COVID-19 death count, physical activity, and negative emotions. (4) Results: The COVID-19 death count showed a direct negative impact on general sleep quality (Î² = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.55, 2.19) and reduced aggressiveness (Î² = -6.57, 95% CI: -12.78, -0.36). In contrast, the COVID-19 death count imposed not a direct but an indirect impact on general negative emotions (indirect effect (IE) = 0.81, <i>p</i> = 0.012), stress (IE = 0.40, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and anxiety (IE = 0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.004) with sleep quality as a mediator. Moreover, physical activity directly alleviated general negative emotions (Î² = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.22, -0.01), and the maximal mitigation effect occurred when weekly physical activity was about 2500 METs. (5) Conclusions: (a) The severity of the COVID-19 outbreak has an indirect effect on negative emotions by affecting sleep quality. (b) A possible mitigation strategy for improving mental health includes taking suitable amounts of daily physical activity and sleeping well.","Zhang, Zhang, Ma, Di","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17103722","20200608","coronavirus; mental health; mitigation strategies; physical activity; sleep quality; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Exercise; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Correlation between immune response and self-reported depression during convalescence from COVID-19","Self-reported depression has been observed in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during discharge from the hospital. However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients.","Yuan, Li, Liu, Cai, Song, Zhao, Hu, Li, Chen, Zhang, Liu, Peng, Wang, Wang, An","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062","20200604","Blood routine analysis; Convalescent COVID-19 patients; Immunity response; Self-reported depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 on ophthalmologists-in-training and practising ophthalmologists in India","To evaluate the psychological impact of the COVID 19 crisis on ophthalmologists-in-training and practising ophthalmologists during lockdown in India. An online survey was completed by ophthalmologists and ophthalmology trainees during the lockdown. The information collected included demographics (age, gender), domicile (state, union territory), current professional status (in training or practising), type of practice (solo, group, institutional, governmental, non-governmental), marital status (married, single), impact of COVID-19 on their training or practice, and impact on income and ability to meet living expenses. Psychological distress was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In all, 2,355 ophthalmologists responded. Mean age was 42.5 (range, 25-82 years; SD, 12.05) years. Of these, 1,332 (56.7%) were males; 475 (20.2%) were still not in practice; 366 (15.5%) were single; 1,244 (52.8%) felt that COVID-19 would impact on their training or professional work; and 869 (37%) had difficulty in meeting their living expenses. The mean PHQ-9 score was 3.98 (range, 0-27; SD, 4.65). In terms of psychological impact, 768 (32.6%) had some degree of depression; mild in 504 (21.4%), moderate in 163 (6.9%), and severe in 101 (4.3%). Multivariable analysis showed that depression was significantly higher at younger age. The odds of depression decreased by 3% with 1 year increase in age. It was higher in non-practicing ophthalmologists, especially those who were considerably worried about their training or professional growth, and those with difficulty in meeting living expenses. A strikingly high proportion of ophthalmologists are psychologically affected and may require personalized mental health care.","Khanna, Honavar, Metla, Bhattacharya, Maulik","https://doi.org/10.4103/ijo.IJO_1458_20","20200605","COVID-19; Coronavirus; India; SARS COV-2; ophthalmologists; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depressive Disorder; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; India; Internship and Residency; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmologists; Ophthalmology; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological; Students, Medical","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"'Policing' a pandemic: Garda wellbeing and COVID-19","In response to the global pandemic COVID-19, the Irish government has called upon the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na to implement an unparalleled mode of policing to mitigate and contain the spread of the Coronavirus. Studies investigating smaller scale epidemics, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), indicate that staff at the frontlines of an outbreak are exposed to an insuperable amount of stress and experience increased psychological morbidities as a result. Furthermore, research not only indicates that heighted levels of psychological distress are an occupational hazard associated with the law enforcement profession, but that members of the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na feel their mental health needs are largely unmet by their organisation. Given the pandemic's propensity to expose officers to indeterminate echelons of physical and psychological threat; there has never been a more appropriate time to explore the potential burdens associated with 'policing' a pandemic, question the governments capacity to address the psychological support needs of frontline professionals, and plan future research for best practice.","Rooney, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.70","20200619","COVID-19; Pandemic; Policing; The Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na; psychological support needs","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Well-being and education of urology residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of an American National Survey","The rapid spread of COVID-19 has placed tremendous strain on the American healthcare system. Few prior studies have evaluated the well-being of or changes to training for American resident physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. We aim to study predictors of trainee well-being and changes to clinical practice using an anonymous survey of American urology residents. An anonymous, voluntary, 47-question survey was sent to all ACGME-accredited urology programmes in the United States. We executed a cross-sectional analysis evaluating risk factors of perception of anxiety and depression both at work and home and educational outcomes. Multiple linear regressions models were used to estimate beta coefficients and 95% confidence intervals. Among ~1800 urology residents in the USA, 356 (20%) responded. Among these respondents, 24 had missing data leaving a sample size of 332. Important risk factors of mental health outcomes included perception of access to PPE, local COVID-19 severity and perception of susceptible household members. Risk factors for declination of redeployment included current redeployment, having children and concerns regarding ability to reach case minimums. Risk factors for concern of achieving operative autonomy included cancellation of elective cases and higher level of training. Several potential actions, which could be taken by urology residency programme directors and hospital administration, may optimise urology resident well-being, morale, and education. These include advocating for adequate access to PPE, providing support at both the residency programme and institutional levels, instituting telehealth education programmes, and fostering a sense of shared responsibility of COVID-19 patients.","Khusid, Weinstein, Becerra, Kashani, Robins, Fink, Smith, Weiss","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13559","20200628",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of â‰¥9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores.

"Projected increases in suicide in Canada as a consequence of COVID-19","Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide. We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority. Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.","McIntyre, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113104","20200714",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Flattening the Mental Health Curve: COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders Are Associated With Alterations in Mental Health Search Behavior in the United States","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has led to dramatic changes worldwide in people's everyday lives. To combat the pandemic, many governments have implemented social distancing, quarantine, and stay-at-home orders. There is limited research on the impact of such extreme measures on mental health. The goal of this study was to examine whether stay-at-home orders produced differential changes in mental health symptoms using internet search queries on a national scale. In the United States, individual states vary in their adoption of measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19; as of March 23, 2020, 11 of the 50 states had issued stay-at-home orders. The staggered rollout of stay-at-home measures across the United States allows us to investigate whether these measures impact mental health by exploring variations in mental health search queries across the states. This paper examines the changes in mental health search queries on Google between March 16-23, 2020, across each state and Washington, DC. Specifically, this paper examines differential changes in mental health searches based on patterns of search activity following issuance of stay-at-home orders in these states compared to all other states. The participants were all the people who searched mental health terms in Google between March 16-23. Between March 16-23, 11 states underwent stay-at-home orders to prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Outcomes included search terms measuring anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive, negative thoughts, irritability, fatigue, anhedonia, concentration, insomnia, and suicidal ideation. Analyzing over 10 million search queries using generalized additive mixed models, the results suggested that the implementation of stay-at-home orders are associated with a significant flattening of the curve for searches for suicidal ideation, anxiety, negative thoughts, and sleep disturbances, with the most prominent flattening associated with suicidal ideation and anxiety. These results suggest that, despite decreased social contact, mental health search queries increased rapidly prior to the issuance of stay-at-home orders, and these changes dissipated following the announcement and enactment of these orders. Although more research is needed to examine sustained effects, these results suggest mental health symptoms were associated with an immediate leveling off following the issuance of stay-at-home orders.","Jacobson, Lekkas, Price, Heinz, Song, O'Malley, Barr","https://doi.org/10.2196/19347","20200606","COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; health information needs; infodemiology; infoveillance; mental health; search trends; stay-at-home orders; suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The potential long-term impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on patients with non-communicable diseases in Europe: consequences for healthy ageing","The early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic have focused on containing SARS-CoV-2 infection and identifying treatment strategies. While controlling this communicable disease is of utmost importance, the long-term effect on individuals with non-communicable diseases (NCD) is significant. Although certain NCDs appear to increase the severity of COVID-19 and mortality risk, SARS-CoV-2 infection in survivors with NCDs may also affect the progression of their pre-existing clinical conditions. Infection containment measures will have substantial short- and long-term consequences; social distancing and quarantine restrictions will reduce physical activity and increase other unhealthy lifestyles, thus increasing NCD risk factors and worsening clinical symptoms. Vitamin D levels might decreaseÂ and there might be a rise in mental health disorders. Many countries have made changes to routine management of NCD patients, e.g., cancelling non-urgent outpatient visits, which will have important implications for NCD management, diagnosis of new-onset NCDs, medication adherence, and NCD progression. We may have opportunities to learn from this unprecedented crisis on how to leverage healthcare technologies and improve procedures to optimize healthcare service provision. This article discusses how the COVID-19 outbreak and related infection control measures could hit the most frail individuals, worsening the condition of NCD patients, while further jeopardizing the sustainability of the healthcare systems. We suggest ways to define an integrated strategy that could involve both public institutional entities and theÂ private sector to safeguard frail individuals and mitigate the impact of the outbreak.","Palmer, Monaco, Kivipelto, Onder, Maggi, Michel, Prieto, Sykara, Donde","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01601-4","20200702","COVID-19; Chronic diseases; Coronavirus; Elderly; Frailty; NCD; SARS-coV-2; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Progression; Europe; Frail Elderly; Frailty; Healthy Aging; Humans; Infection Control; Loneliness; Noncommunicable Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and COVID-19","The media have featured the antimalarials chloroquine (CQ) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to treat coronavirus (COVID-19). Political leaders have touted their use and recommended availability to the public. These anti-inflammatory agents have substantial human toxicity with a narrow therapeutic window. CQ and HCQ poisoning cause myocardial depression and profound hypotension due to vasodilation. Bradycardia and ventricular escape rhythms arise from impaired myocardial automaticity and conductivity due to sodium and potassium channel blockade. With cardiotoxicity, ECGs may show widened QRS, atrioventricular heart block and QT interval prolongation. CQ may also cause seizures, often refractory to standard treatment. Of concern is pediatric poisoning, where 1-2 pills of CQ or HCQ can cause serious and potentially fatal toxicity in a toddler. The treatment of CQ/HCQ poisoning includes high-dose intravenous diazepam postulated to have positive ionotropic and antidysrhythmic properties that may antagonize the cardiotoxic effects of CQ. Infusions of epinephrine titrated to treat unstable hypotension, as well as potassium for severe hypokalemia may be required. Current scientific evidence does not support treatment or prophylactic use of these agents for COVID-19 disease. Regulatory and public health authorities recognize that CQ/HCQ may offer little clinical benefit and only add risk requiring further investigation before wider public distribution.","Erickson, Chai, Boyer","https://doi.org/10.1080/24734306.2020.1757967","20200530","Chloroquine; coronavirus; diazepam; epinephrine; hydroxychloroquine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Adapting IAPT services to support frontline NHS staff during the Covid-19 pandemic: the Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway","The Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic is exerting unprecedented pressure on NHS Health and Social Care provisions, with frontline staff, such as those of critical care units, encountering vast practical and emotional challenges on a daily basis. Although staff are being supported through organisational provisions, facilitated by those in leadership roles, the emergence of mental health difficulties or the exacerbation of existing ones amongst these members of staff is a cause for concern. Acknowledging this, academics and healthcare professionals alike are calling for psychological support for frontline staff, which not only addresses distress during the initial phases of the outbreak but also over the months, if not years, that follow. Fortunately, mental health services and psychology professional bodies across the United Kingdom have issued guidance to meet these needs. An attempt has been made to translate these sets of guidance into clinical provisions via the recently established Homerton Covid Psychological Support (HCPS) pathway delivered by Talk Changes (Hackney &amp; City IAPT). This article describes the phased, stepped-care and evidence-based approach that has been adopted by the service to support local frontline NHS staff.

"SARS-CoV-2 strategically mimics proteolytic activation of human ENaC","Molecular mimicry is an evolutionary strategy adopted by viruses to exploit the host cellular machinery. We report that SARS-CoV-2 has evolved a unique S1/S2 cleavage site, absent in any previous coronavirus sequenced, resulting in the striking mimicry of an identical FURIN-cleavable peptide on the human epithelial sodium channel Î±-subunit (ENaC-Î±). Genetic alteration of ENaC-Î± causes aldosterone dysregulation in patients, highlighting that the FURIN site is critical for activation of ENaC. Single cell RNA-seq from 66 studies shows significant overlap between expression of ENaC-Î± and the viral receptor ACE2 in cell types linked to the cardiovascular-renal-pulmonary pathophysiology of COVID-19. Triangulating this cellular characterization with cleavage signatures of 178 proteases highlights proteolytic degeneracy wired into the SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 into a global pandemic may be driven in part by its targeted mimicry of ENaC-Î±, a protein critical for the homeostasis of airway surface liquid, whose misregulation is associated with respiratory conditions. Viruses hijack the cellular machinery of humans to infect their cells and multiply. The virus causing the global COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2, is no exception. Identifying which proteins in human cells the virus co-opts is crucial for developing new ways to diagnose, prevent and treat COVID-19 infections. SARS-CoV-2 is covered in spike-shaped proteins, which the virus uses to gain entry into cells. First, the spikes bind to a protein called ACE2, which is found on the cells that line the respiratory tract and lungs. SARS-CoV-2 then exploits enzymes called proteases to cut, or cleave, its spikes at a specific site which allows the virus to infiltrate the host cell. Proteases identify which proteins to target based on the sequence of amino acids â€“ the building blocks of proteins â€“ at the cleavage site. However, it remained unclear which human proteases SARS-CoV-2 co-opts and whether its cut site is similar to human proteins. Now, Anand et al. show that the spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2 may have the same sequence of amino acids at its cut site as a human epithelial channel protein called ENaC-Î±. This channel is important for maintaining the balance of salt and water in many organs including the lungs. Further analyses showed that ENaC-Î± is often found in the same types of human lung and respiratory tract cells as ACE2. This suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may use the same proteases that cut ENaC-Î± to get inside human respiratory cells. It is possible that by hijacking the cutting mechanism for ENaC-Î±, SARS-CoV-2 interferes with the balance of salt and water in the lungs of COVID-19 patients. This may help explain why the virus causes severe respiratory symptoms. However, more studies are needed to confirm that the proteases that cut ENaC-Î± also cut the spike proteins on SARS-CoV-2, and how this affects the respiratory health of COVID-19 patients.","Anand, Puranik, Aravamudan, Venkatakrishnan, Soundararajan","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58603","20200715","COVID-19; ENaC; SARS-CoV-2; acute respiratory distress syndrome; computational biology; coronavirus; human; human biology; medicine; molecular mimicry; mouse; systems biology; virus; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epithelial Sodium Channels; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Molecular Mimicry; Pandemics; Peptide Hydrolases; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Proteolysis; Substrate Specificity; Viral Envelope Proteins; Viral Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Airborne Aerosol Generation During Endonasal Procedures in the Era of COVID-19: Risks and Recommendations","In the era of SARS-CoV-2, the risk of infectious airborne aerosol generation during otolaryngologic procedures has been an area of increasing concern. The objective of this investigation was to quantify airborne aerosol production under clinical and surgical conditions and examine efficacy of mask mitigation strategies. Prospective quantification of airborne aerosol generation during surgical and clinical simulation. Cadaver laboratory and clinical examination room. Airborne aerosol quantification with an optical particle sizer was performed in real time during cadaveric simulated endoscopic surgical conditions, including hand instrumentation, microdebrider use, high-speed drilling, and cautery. Aerosol sampling was additionally performed in simulated clinical and diagnostic settings. All clinical and surgical procedures were evaluated for propensity for significant airborne aerosol generation. Hand instrumentation and microdebridement did not produce detectable airborne aerosols in the range of 1 to 10 Î¼m. Suction drilling at 12,000 rpm, high-speed drilling (4-mm diamond or cutting burs) at 70,000 rpm, and transnasal cautery generated significant airborne aerosols (<i>P</i> &lt; .001). In clinical simulations, nasal endoscopy (<i>P</i> &lt; .05), speech (<i>P</i> &lt; .01), and sneezing (<i>P</i> &lt; .01) generated 1- to 10-Î¼m airborne aerosols.

"The management of surgical patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised several issues regarding the management of surgical patients. The aim of the current study was to clarify the management of oncologic and surgical patients during the pandemic. Relevant publications reporting on the epidemiology of the pandemic, the diagnosis of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, and the clinical management of cancer and surgical patients, as well as studies concerning health care workers' safety, were included. The last date of research for this study was April 4,Â 2020. We analyzed 28 papers. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19, and computed tomography scans were considered useful for cases of diagnostic uncertainty. Cancer patients and surgical patients were confirmed to be particularly at risk of infection and negative outcome. To guarantee adequate care to these patients, while minimizing the risk for infection, the early postponing of elective surgery, the creation of COVID-free facilities and the identification of COVID- dedicated operating theaters and teams have been proposed. The correct use of personal protective equipment was also strongly advocated, along with the institution of facilities for the psychologic support of health care workers. Clinicians should be aware of the importance of providing adequate care to patients with urgent and nondeferrable clinical issues, such as cancer. Every effort should be made to contain the virus spread in the hospital setting. Also, clinicians should value the importance of self-protection and mental health care.","Spolverato, Capelli, Restivo, Bao, Pucciarelli, Pawlik, Gronchi","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.04.036","20200702","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Patient Safety; Perioperative Care; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"University students' mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece","The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a 'horizontal' increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.","Kaparounaki, Patsali, Mousa, Papadopoulou, Papadopoulou, Fountoulakis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113111","20200714","COVID-19; Conspiracy theories; Depression; Lockdonw; Mental health; Quarantine; Suicidality; University students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown among students and workers of a Spanish university","The aim of this study was to analyze the psychological impact of COVID-19 in the university community during the first weeks of confinement. A cross-sectional study was conducted. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) was employed to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The emotional impact of the situation was analyzed using the Impact of Event Scale. An online survey was fulfilled by 2530 members of the University of Valladolid, in Spain. Moderate to extremely severe scores of anxiety, depression, and stress were reported by 21.34%, 34.19% and 28.14% of the respondents, respectively. A total of 50.43% of respondents presented moderate to severe impact of the outbreak. Students from Arts &amp; Humanities and Social Sciences &amp; Law showed higher scores related to anxiety, depression, stress and impact of event with respect to students from Engineering &amp; Architecture. University staff presented lower scores in all measures compared to students, who seem to have suffered an important psychological impact during the first weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown. In order to provide timely crisis-oriented psychological services and to take preventive measures in future pandemic situations, mental health in university students should be carefully monitored.","Odriozola-GonzÃ¡lez, Planchuelo-GÃ³mez, Irurtia, de Luis-GarcÃ­a","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113108","20200714","Anxiety; Depression; Psychological impact; Stress; University students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life in Spanish patients with Alzheimer's disease during the COVID-19 lockdown","The COVID-19 epidemic is affecting almost all individuals worldwide, and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are particularly at risk due to their characteristics and age. We analysed the impact of the pandemic on these patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms and their quality of life after 5Â weeks of lockdown in Spain. A total of 40 patients with a diagnosis of MCI (n = 20) or mild AD (n = 20) from the Cognitive Stimulation Program of the Cognitive Disorders Unit were evaluated. All patients had undergone a previous evaluation during the month before the lockdown, and were re-evaluated after 5Â weeks of lockdown. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and EuroQol-5D questionnaire (EQ-5D) were used to assess neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients and the quality of life in patients as well in caregivers. The mean (SD) total baseline NPI score was 33.75 (22.28), compared with 39.05 (27.96) after confinement (PÂ =Â 0.028). The most frequently affected neuropsychiatric symptoms were apathy [4.15 (3.78) vs. 5.75 (4.02); PÂ =Â 0.002] and anxiety [3.95 (3.73) vs. 5.30 (4.01); PÂ =Â 0.006] in patients with MCI, and apathy [2.35 (2.70) vs. 3.75 (3.78); PÂ =Â 0.036], agitation [0.45 (1.14) vs. 1.50 (2.66); PÂ =Â 0.029] and aberrant motor behaviour [1.25 (2.86) vs. 2.00 (2.93); PÂ =Â 0.044] in patients with AD. We did not observe differences in EQ-5D scores during the re-evaluation. The 30% of patients and 40% of caregivers reported a worsening of the patients' health status during confinement. The results of this study show the worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with AD and MCI during 5Â weeks of lockdown, with agitation, apathy and aberrant motor activity being the most affected symptoms.","Lara, Carnes, Dakterzada, Benitez, PiÃ±ol-Ripoll","https://doi.org/10.1111/ene.14339","20200624","Alzheimerâ€™s disease; COVID-19; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; mild cognitive impairment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Long-term clinical outcomes in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus outbreaks after hospitalisation or ICU admission: A systematic review and meta-analysis","To determine long-term clinical outcomes in survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus infections after hospitalization or intensive care unit admission. Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, and PsycINFO were searched. Original studies reporting clinical outcomes of adult SARS and MERS survivors 3 months after admission or 2 months after discharge were included. Studies were graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine 2009 Level of Evidence Tool. Meta-analysis was used to derive pooled estimates for prevalence/severity of outcomes up to 6 months after hospital discharge, and beyond 6 months after discharge. Of 1,169 identified studies, 28 were included in the analysis. Pooled analysis revealed that common complications up to 6 months after discharge were: impaired diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (prevalence 27%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 15â€“45%); and reduced exercise capacity (mean 6-min walking distance 461 m, CI 450â€“473 m). The prevalences of post-traumatic stress disorder (39%, 95% CI 31â€“47%), depression (33%, 95% CI 20â€“50%) and anxiety (30%, 95% CI 10â€“61) beyond 6 months after discharge were considerable. Low scores on Short-Form 36 were identified beyond 6 months after discharge. Lung function abnormalities, psychological impairment and reduced exercise capacity were common in SARS and MERS survivors.

"The impact of having inadequate safety equipment on mental health","Concerns are being raised about the impact of inadequate safety equipment on the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 medical response. To assess the impact of inadequate safety equipment on the mental health of service personnel deployed on operations in order to better understand the impact on those working under the similarly demanding conditions of the COVID-19 medical response. Self-report surveys were conducted in four operational environments with 3435 personnel providing data. Surveys recorded data on socio-demographic, military and operational characteristics, mental health measures and specific occupational stressors. Analysis through logistic regression explored the association between inadequate equipment and all other factors. A total of 3401 personnel provided data on their perceptions of the adequacy of their equipment, of which 532 (15%) stated that they had a lot of concerns that they did not have the right equipment in working order. Analysis found significantly greater odds of reporting symptoms of common mental health disorders (CMD), 2.49 (2.03-3.06), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 2.99 (2.11-4.24), poorer global health 2.09 (1.62-2.70) and emotional problems 1.69 (1.38-2.06) when individuals reported working with inadequate equipment. Analyses remained significant when adjusted for confounding factors such as rank, sex and operational environment. An individual's perception of having inadequate equipment is significantly associated with symptoms of CMD, probable PTSD, poorer global health and increased reporting of emotional problems. This in turn may impact on their ability to safely carry out their duties and may have longer-term mental health consequences.","Simms, Fear, Greenberg","https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa101","20200629","COVID-19; mental health; presenteeism; protective equipment; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Military Personnel; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Self Report","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Digital technology can revolutionize mental health services delivery: The COVID-19 crisis as a catalyst for change","The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis presents an imperative for mental health care systems to make digital mental health interventions a routine part of care. Already because of COVID-19, many therapists have rapidly moved to using telehealth in place of in-person contact. In response to this shift, Waller and colleagues compiled a series of expert recommendations to help clinicians pivot to delivering teletherapy to address eating disorders during COVID-19. However, numerous barriers still impede widespread adoption and implementation of digital interventions. In this commentary, we aim to extend the recommendations for clinicians offered by Waller and colleagues by presenting a roadmap of the systems- and policy-level requirements that are needed. We advocate for addressing barriers associated with training, licensing, safety, privacy, payment, and evaluation, as these factors have greatly limited use of these promising interventions. We also indicate that longer-term goals should include introducing truly innovative digital mental health practices, such as stepped-care models and simultaneously providing preventive and self-management services in addition to clinical services, into the health care system. Now is the time to catalyze change and comprehensively address the barriers that have prevented widespread delivery of these efficacious digital services to the millions of people who would benefit.","Taylor, Fitzsimmons-Craft, Graham","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23300","20200709","COVID-19; coronavirus; digital technology; mental health services; telehealth; Betacoronavirus; Cognition; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Feeding and Eating Disorders; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Uptrend in distress and psychiatric symptomatology in pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Prenatal maternal distress has a negative impact on the course of pregnancy, fetal development, offspring development, and later psychopathologies. The study aimed to determine the extent to which the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may aggravate the prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology of pregnant women. Two cohorts of pregnant volunteer women were evaluated, one that was recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic (nÂ =Â 496) through advertisements in prenatal clinics in Quebec, Canada, from April 2018 to March 2020; the other (nÂ =Â 1258) was recruited online during the pandemic from 2 April to 13 April 2020. Prenatal distress and psychiatric symptomatology were measured with the Kessler Distress Scale (K10), Post-traumatic Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The 1754 pregnant women (M<sub>age</sub> Â =Â 29.27, SDÂ =Â 4.23) were between 4 and 41 gestational weeks (MÂ =Â 24.80, SDÂ =Â 9.42), were generally educated (91.3% had post-high-school training), and financially well-resourced (85.3% were above the low-income cut-off). A multivariate analysis of covariance controlling for age, gestational age, household income, education, and lifetime psychiatric disorders showed a large effect size (ES) in the difference between the two cohorts on psychiatric symptoms (Wilks' Î»Â =Â 0.68, F<sub>6,1400</sub> Â =Â 108.50, PÂ &lt;Â .001, partial Î·<sup>2</sup> Â =Â 0.32). According to post-hoc analyses of covariance, the COVID-19 women reported higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ESÂ =Â 0.57), dissociative symptoms (ESÂ =Â 0.22 and ESÂ =Â 0.25), symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (ESÂ =Â 0.19), and negative affectivity (ESÂ =Â 0.96), and less positive affectivity (ESÂ =Â 0.95) than the pre-COVID-19 cohort. Women from the COVID-19 cohort were more likely than pre-COVID-19 women to present clinically significant levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (ORÂ =Â 1.94, Ï‡<sup>2</sup> [1]Â =Â 10.05, PÂ =Â .002). Multiple regression analyses indicated that pregnant women in the COVID-19 cohort having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or low income would be more prone to elevated distress and psychiatric symptoms. Pregnant women assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic reported more distress and psychiatric symptoms than pregnant women assessed before the pandemic, mainly in the form of depression and anxiety symptoms. Given the harmful consequences of prenatal distress on mothers and offspring, the presently observed upsurge of symptoms in pregnant women calls for special means of clinical surveillance.","Berthelot, Lemieux, Garon-Bissonnette, Drouin-Maziade, Martel, Maziade","https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.13925","20200630","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; depression; mental health; mothers; post-traumatic stress disorder; pregnancy; prenatal; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Gymnastics-sports activities: health benefits in emergency period CoViD-19 How to organize a quick shot]","Regular physical activity grants significant health effects and lowers the risk of premature death for all causes, in particular cardiovascular ones in asymptomatic subjects. Physical activity is useful in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular and lung diseases, metabolic diseases, musculoskeletal diseases, cancer and depression. Recent studies correlate inactivity with chronic low-grade inflammation and obesity, at the origin of chronic non-communicable diseases. The evidence must be taken seriously into consideration in this particular CoViD-19 emergency period and long-term effects of prolonged limitation of sports activity must not be overlooked. Contagion in open places is very difficult and the absolute prohibition of sports activities in open places and the closure of parks are creating discomfort and confusion.

Cross- sectional study. A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p&lt;0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1-6 months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p&lt;0.0001), daily (61%; p&lt;0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p&lt;0.0001) and for 30-60min (72%).

The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015-2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.","Slaunwhite, Gan, Xavier, Zhao, Buxton, Desai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047","20200629","COVID-19; Overdose; Risk factors; Substance use; Adult; Betacoronavirus; British Columbia; Chi-Square Distribution; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Overdose; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Public Health; Research Design; Risk Factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Medications in COVID-19 patients: summarizing the current literature from an orthopaedic perspective","The review aims to provide a summary of the current literature regarding common medications prescribed in orthopaedic surgery and their potential implications in COVID-19 patients. A systematic review was performed using the PRISMA guidelines. All clinical studies, reviews, consensus and guidelines related to the above medications and COVID-19 were included. A total of 18 articles were included. The use of analgesia, anti-inflammatories, steroids, anticoagulants, antibiotics, vitamin B, vitamin C and vitamin D and their potential impact on COVID-19 patients were reported. Eight main recommendations were derived from the review. Firstly, paracetamol remains the first line of analgesia and antipyretic. Secondly, there is no need to avoid NSAIDs for COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, opioids have the potential for immunosuppression in addition to respiratory depression and, therefore, should be prescribed with care in COVID-19 patients. Fourthly, patients with conditions where steroids are proven to be efficacious can continue to receive their steroids; otherwise, systemic steroids are not recommended for COVID-19 patients. Fifthly, orthopaedic surgeons following up on COVID-19 patients who are using steroids should continue to follow them up for possible avascular necrosis. Sixthly, whenever possible, oral anticoagulation should be converted to parental heparin. Seventhly, common orthopaedic antibiotics including penicillin and clindamycin are safe to continue for COVID-19 patients. However, for COVID-19 patients, the antibiotics can potentially be switched to macrolides and tetracyclines if the organisms are sensitive. Lastly, prescription for vitamins B, C and D should continue as per usual clinical practice.","Tan, Hong, Saha, Murphy, Hui","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00264-020-04643-5","20200725","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Medications; Orthopaedics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS). A total of N = 908 Chinese adults (mean age = 40.37 years, SD = 9.27; n = 752 female) participated in a survey distributed between February 24 and March 15, 2020. Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19.

"The proteasome as a druggable target with multiple therapeutic potentialities: Cutting and non-cutting edges","Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an adaptable and finely tuned system that sustains proteostasis network under a large variety of physiopathological conditions. Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.","Tundo, Sbardella, Santoro, Coletta, Oddone, Grasso, Milardi, Lacal, Marini, Purrello, Graziani, Coletta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579","20200721","Cancer; Neurodegeneration; Proteasome; Proteasome inhibitors; SARS-Cov-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is penetrating to dementia research","1. Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in late December, 2019. Despite the tremendous efforts to control the disease, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 1,5 million people and caused the death of more than a hundred thousand people across the globe as of writing. Recently, Mao et al. [1] investigated the penetration potential of SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system in 214 patients. They reported that 36.4% of the patients had some neurologic findings which are ranged from nonspecific manifestations, e.g., dizziness, headache, and seizure, to specific manifestations, e.g., loss of sense of smell or taste, and stroke. Whether these common symptoms in their patients are related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not known. However, it is important to mention here that dramatic neurologic symptoms, i.e., depressed level of consciousness, seizure, and stroke, are common in the patients at the late stage of the disease, accounting for increased mortality rate in severely affected patients. Nevertheless, to objectively delve into the direct relation between the neurologic symptoms and COVID-19, medical comorbidities of patients should also be considered [2]. Further studies are needed because we are in the midst of an ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, and neurologists may be confronted with new-onset neurologic symptoms owing to COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 penetrates via human angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 receptor (ACE-2) that was also utilized by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) [3]. Glial cells and neurons have been reported to express ACE-2 receptors, which make them a potential target of COVID-19. It was indicated that SARS CoV causes neuronal death by invading the brain via olfactory epithelium [4]. The electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and real-time reverse transcription- PCR findings have corroborated the presence of SARS-CoV in the brain tissue [4] and cerebrospinal fluid [5]. Together, it can be speculated that SARS-CoV-2 can affect the brain by penetrating the brain via the cribriform plate, which can account for the early findings of the COVID-19 like altered sense of smell or hyposmia. Because SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory symptoms in people aged 60 years and older, it has important implications for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) [6]. Therefore, in the countries that have taken action to the virus, clinic studies of AD have been stopped to protect the patients. However, rigorous quarantine of elders has aborted clinic trials and experimental studies conducted with transgenic animals. Transgenic models are quite expensive; the loss of these animals has costly consequences. There is no doubt that this storm will stop, but its catastrophic effects on dementia research will continue for a time. Thus, dementia researchers and pharmaceutical companies should determine an emergency action plan to exit the chaos of this pandemic. Here, we listed some challenges in dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak and table some suggestions. All countries try to control SARS-CoV-2 by social distancing. Therefore, neurology clinics were closed, and routine examination of Alzheimer's patients was stopped. However, the lockdown of patients with AD caused clinical studies to stop. which has severely affected dementia research. Additionally, the arrest of experimental studies due to the closing of universities in two hundred countries also deprives experimental achievements. The closing of universities may lead to data loss, death of expensive transgenic animals, international researchers to be faced with visa problems, and be lost the laboratory staff whose contract has expired [7]. It is impossible that forecasting when this COVID-19 pandemic will end is impossible and thus, it is essential that a solution be developed to continue dementia studies on Alzheimer's patients. Remote monitoring of the patients with the use of technology is in the lead of possible solutions. Clinicians can continue to follow their patients by telemedicine [8], but extended lockdown of patients may cause depression in both patients and their caregivers [9]. It is also known that movement restriction exacerbates AD symptoms [10]. The monitorization of the patient in this condition with telemedicine would not provide objective data. In addition, when patients living in rural areas are considered, it will not be a surprise that reaching equally all patients is impossible. Therefore, a collective action plan protecting dementia research during the COVID-19 outbreak should be prepared by a consortium of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, clinicians, and patients. Data loss is in the lead of expected problems during the COVID-19 outbreak. For example, the planned ending dates of phase 2/3 trials of gantenerumab (Roche) and solanezumab (Lilly) were missed [11]. It is highly essential that patients be monitored from their homes with telemedicine to protect them. Nonetheless, it is not sufficient for the continuation of clinical trials and experimental studies. We suggest that patients of phase trails should be isolated in fully-equipped nursing homes managed by qualified personnel. In this way, the patients can be more effectively protected from SARS-CoV-2 and the depression caused by the lockdown.Young family members going out for basic needs could infect older family members. Also, patients with AD pay less attention to hand hygiene, which makes them more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, cats have recently been shown to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 [12]. Patients with AD may not follow directions of neurologists on telemedicine and thus, the interaction of Alzheimer's patients with pets can cause a dangerous scenario. Consequently, the lockdown of patients with dementia in their homes might not be an appropriate exit strategy for the future of dementia research. On the other hand, it is important to mention here that the nursing home capacity of the United States may not be sufficient for 5,8 million Alzheimer's patients aged 65 years and older [13]. Thus, we highlight that only the patients involved in the clinic trails should be followed in the nursing homes. The other patients can be monitored with telemedicine from their homes. The data will hardly be lost in patients isolated in nursing homes. In this strategy, secondary risk factors affecting the clinic trails like depression are also removed. The motivations of clinicians and researchers is as important as the patients in the catastrophic atmosphere of the outbreak. Governments, media, and funders can support the motivations of clinicians and researchers. For example, research funders and pharmaceutical companies can extend project deadlines and provide an additional promotion to the researchers who have completed their clinic trails. Consequently, a global action plan should be prepared to block SARS-CoV-2 penetration to dementia research. At first glance, it may be thought that the most appropriate strategy for patients with dementia is social isolation in their homes during the outbreak as in healthy young people and elders. However, we suggest that isolating patients with dementia in fully-equipped nursing homes can be a more appropriate exit strategy for the protection of dementia patients and research.","Bostanciklioglu","https://doi.org/10.2174/1567202617666200522220509","20200527","Alzheimer's disease; COVID-19 outbreak; Dementia; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Nonserologic test for COVID-19: How to manage?","Diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Coranavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is currently based on real-time PCR (RT-PCR) performed on either nasopharyngeal (NPS) or oropharyngeal (OPS) swabs; saliva specimen collection can be used, too. Diagnostic accuracy of these procedures is suboptimal, and some procedural mistakes may account for it. The video shows how to properly collect secretions from the upper airways for nonserologic diagnosis of COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), oropharyngeal swab (OPS), and deep saliva collection after throat-cleaning maneuver, all performed under videoendoscopic view by a trained ENT examiner. We recommend to perform NPS after elevation of the tip of the nose in order to reduce the risk of contamination from the nasal vestible, and to let it flow over the floor of the nasal cavity in parallel to the hard palate in order to reach the nasopharynx. Then the tip of the swab should be left in place for few seconds, and then rotated in order to achieve the largest absorption of nasopharyngeal secretions. Regards OPS, gentle anterior tongue depression should be used to avoid swab contamination from the oral cavity during collection of secretions from the posterior pharyngeal wall. These procedural tricks would enhance diagnostic reliability.","Torretta, Zuccotti, Cristofaro, Ettori, Solimeno, Battilocchi, D'Onghia, Pignataro, Capaccio","https://doi.org/10.1002/hed.26270","20200720","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Endoscopy; Humans; Nasopharynx; Oropharynx; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Saliva; Specimen Handling; Video Recording","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older people: a rapid review","The current COVID-19 pandemic has been identified as a possible trigger for increases in loneliness and social isolation among older people due to the restrictions on movement that many countries have put in place. Loneliness and social isolation are consistently identified as risk factors for poor mental and physical health in older people. Video calls may help older people stay connected during the current crisis by widening the participant's social circle or by increasing the frequency of contact with existing acquaintances. The primary objective of this rapid review is to assess the effectiveness of video calls for reducing social isolation and loneliness in older adults. The review also sought to address the effectiveness of video calls on reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life. We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL from 1 January 2004 to 7 April 2020. We also searched the references of relevant systematic reviews. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs (including cluster designs) were eligible for inclusion. We excluded all other study designs. The samples in included studies needed to have a mean age of at least 65 years. We included studies that included participants whether or not they were experiencing symptoms of loneliness or social isolation at baseline.Â Any intervention in which a core component involved the use of the internet to facilitate video calls or video conferencing through computers, smartphones or tablets with the intention of reducing loneliness or social isolation, or both, in older adults was eligible for inclusion. We included studies in the review if they reported self-report measures of loneliness, social isolation, symptoms of depression or quality of life.Â Two review authors screened 25% of abstracts; a third review author resolved conflicts. A single review author screened the remaining abstracts. The second review author screened all excluded abstracts and we resolved conflicts by consensus or by involving a third review author. We followed the same process for full-text articles. One review author extracted data, which another review author checked. The primary outcomes were loneliness and social isolation and the secondary outcomes were symptoms of depression and quality of life. One review author rated the certainty of evidence for the primary outcomes according to the GRADE approach and another review author checked the ratings. We conducted fixed-effect meta-analyses for the primary outcome, loneliness, and the secondary outcome, symptoms of depression. We identified three cluster quasi-randomised trials, which together included 201 participants. The included studies compared video call interventions to usual care in nursing homes. None of these studies were conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic.Â Each study measured loneliness using the UCLA Loneliness Scale. Total scores range from 20 (least lonely) to 80 (most lonely). The evidence was very uncertain and suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the UCLA Loneliness Scale compared to usual care at three months (mean difference (MD) -0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.28 to 2.41; 3 studies; 201 participants), at six months (MD -0.34, 95% CI -3.41 to 2.72; 2 studies; 152 participants) and at 12 months (MD -2.40, 95% CI -7.20 to 2.40; 1 study; 90 participants). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. None of the included studies reported social isolation as an outcome. Each study measured symptoms of depression using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Total scores range from 0 (better) to 30 (worse). The evidence was very uncertain andÂ suggests that video calls may result in little to no difference in scores on the Geriatric Depression Scale compared to usual care at three months' follow-up (MD 0.41, 95% CI -0.90 to 1.72; 3 studies; 201 participants) or six months' follow-up (MD -0.83, 95% CI -2.43 to 0.76; 2 studies, 152 participants). The evidence suggests that video calls may have a small effect on symptoms of depression at one-year follow-up, though this finding is imprecise (MD -2.04, 95% CI -3.98 to -0.10; 1 study; 90 participants).Â We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Only one study, with 62 participants, reported quality of life. The study measured quality of life using a Taiwanese adaptation of the Short-Form 36-question health survey (SF-36), which consists of eight subscales that measure different aspects of quality of life: physical function; physical role; emotional role; social function; pain: vitality; mental health; and physical health.Â Each subscaleÂ is scored from 0 (poor health) to 100 (good health). The evidence is very uncertain and suggests that there may be little to no difference between people allocated to usual care and those allocated to video calls in three-month scores in physical function (MD 2.88, 95% CI -5.01 to 10.77), physical role (MD -7.66, 95% CI -24.08 to 8.76), emotional role (MD -7.18, 95% CI -16.23 to 1.87), social function (MD 2.77, 95% CI -8.87 to 14.41), pain scores (MD -3.25, 95% CI -15.11 to 8.61), vitality scores (MD -3.60, 95% CI -9.01 to 1.81), mental health (MD 9.19, 95% CI 0.36 to 18.02)Â and physical health (MD 5.16, 95% CI -2.48 to 12.80). We downgraded the certainty of this evidence by three levels for study limitations, imprecision and indirectness. Based on this review there is currently very uncertain evidence on the effectiveness of video call interventions to reduce loneliness in older adults. The review did not include any studies that reported evidence of the effectiveness of video call interventions to address social isolation in older adults. The evidence regarding the effectiveness of video calls for outcomes of symptoms of depression was very uncertain. Future research in this area needs to use more rigorous methods and more diverse and representative participants. Specifically, future studies should target older adults, who are demonstrably lonely or socially isolated, or both, across a range of settings to determine whether video call interventions are effective in a population in which these outcomes are in need of improvement.","Noone, McSharry, Smalle, Burns, Dwan, Devane, Morrissey","https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD013632","20200610","Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Loneliness; Nursing Homes; Online Social Networking; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Social Control, Informal; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Can social isolation caused by physical distance in people with psychosis be overcome through a Phone Pal?","The current pandemic has forced many people into self-isolation and to practice social distancing. When people are physically isolated and distant from each other, technology may play a fundamental role by enabling social connection and reducing feelings of loneliness caused by this prolonged social isolation. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many mental health services worldwide have had to shift their routine face-to-face outpatient appointments to remote telepsychiatry encounters. The increased pressure on mental health services highlights the importance of community-led health-promotion interventions, which can contribute to preventing mental illness or their relapses, and to reduce the burden on health services. Patients with psychosis are particularly socially isolated, have sedentary lifestyles, and commonly face stigma and discrimination from the general population. At the same time, patients with psychosis value technology, are interested in, use and own smart-phones to digitally connect, and are satisfied with their use. Thus, among psychosocial interventions, a helpful resource may be &quot;Phone Pal,&quot; a complex intervention which facilitates remote communication between volunteers and socially isolated patients with psychosis through different smart-phone tools. While &quot;Phone Pal&quot; has been originally developed for people with psychosis, it may also be useful to the wider population, helping to overcome the social isolation caused by physical distancing, particularly in these times of widespread isolation. &quot;Phone Pal&quot; may be a potential public health resource for society, providing important support to those that may need it the most, and possibly benefit most from it.","Pinto da Costa","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.53","20200626","Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Loneliness; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotic Disorders; Smartphone; Social Isolation; Social Stigma; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Older Cancer Patients during the COVID-19 Epidemic: Practice Proposal of the International Geriatric Radiotherapy Group","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented as it reached all countries in the world within a record short period of time. Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.","Nguyen, Vinh-Hung, Baumert, Zamagni, Arenas, Motta, Lara, Myint, Bonet, Popescu, Vuong, Appalanaido, Trigo, Karlsson, Thariat","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12051287","20200616","cancer patients; corona virus 19; epidemic; older; treatment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23Â·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22Â·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38Â·9% across 5 studies. Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.","Pappa, Ntella, Giannakas, Giannakoulis, Papoutsi, Katsaounou","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026","20200623","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Health care workers; Insomnia; Mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic","Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I<sup>2</sup> statistics, and assessment of study quality. 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12Â·2 years (SD 4Â·1) to 68Â·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27Â·9%; 95% CI 20Â·5-36Â·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32Â·6%; 24Â·7-40Â·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35Â·7%; 27Â·6-44Â·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34Â·1%; 26Â·2-42Â·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41Â·9%; 22Â·5-50Â·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0Â·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10Â·5%; 95% CI 7Â·5-14Â·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12Â·1%; 8Â·6-16Â·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12Â·3%; 7Â·7-17Â·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12Â·8%; 8Â·7-17Â·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18Â·9%; 14Â·1-24Â·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19Â·3%; 15Â·1-23Â·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30Â·4%; 23Â·9-37Â·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100Â·0%; 88Â·0-100Â·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32Â·2% (95% CI 23Â·7-42Â·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14Â·9% (12Â·1-18Â·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14Â·8% (11Â·1-19Â·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76Â·9%; 95% CI 68Â·1-84Â·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35Â·3 months (SD 40Â·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

"Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak.

"Covid-19 emergency in prison: Current management and forensic perspectives","The Covid-19 pandemic is currently a major worldwide public health problem. Contagion within prisons and in other custodial settings will need to be addressed promptly, but the management of preventive measures will be difficult due to overcrowding and inmates and officers' close physical contact. There may also be less access to care than in community settings. Accordingly, prisons are particularly vulnerable to outbreaks of infection, and in addition to the likely greater risks of contagion attention must be paid to the psychological problems that the pandemic can have on the prison population. Riots and episodes of violence have already taken place in various prisons. With the inevitable restrictions on social contact and family meetings, prisoners who already are at increased risk of mental illness and suicide are more susceptible to adverse psychological repercussions. From a forensic point of view, therefore, we stress the need for the development of a strong support network by mental health workers for the prison population.","Caputo, Gratteri, Sacco, Scalise, Cacciatore, Bonetta, Zibetti, Aloe, Sicilia, Cordasco, Ricci, Aquila","https://doi.org/10.1177/0025817220923693","20200521","Covid-19; mental health; prison; public health; suicide risk","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Being the second most populous country in the world, experts regard how India deals with the outbreak will have enormous impact on the world's ability to deal with it. The country has been in lockdown since 25th March 2020 until the current time of early May 2020, and despite several challenges there has been early success. The major conflict now is the health benefits weighed up against the deleterious social and economic consequences of prolonged lockdown i.e. life versus livelihood. This unprecedented calamity could potentially cause or exacerbate various psychiatric disorders. It is recognised that lifestyle changes and limited screen time may help reduce mental health difficulties. Considering the physical barriers to consultation, development of telemedicine services is needed.

"SAGES primer for taking care of yourself during and after the COVID-19 crisis","COVID-19 is a pandemic which has affected almost every aspect of our life since starting globally in November 2019. Given the rapidity of spread and inadequate time to prepare for record numbers of sick patients, our surgical community faces an unforeseen challenge. SAGES is committed to the protection and care of patients, their surgeons and staff, and all who are served by the medical community at large. This includes physical health, mental health, and well-being of all involved. The fear of the unknown ahead can be paralyzing. International news media have chronicled the unthinkable situations that physicians and other health care providers have been thrust into as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These situations include making life or death decisions for patients and their families regarding use of limited health care resources. It includes caring for patients with quickly deteriorating conditions and limited treatments available. Until recently, these situations seemed far from home, and now they are in our own hospitals. As the pandemic broadened its reach, the reality that we as surgeons may be joining the front line is real. It may be happening to you now; it may be on the horizon in the coming weeks. In this context, SAGES put together this document addressing concerns on clinician stressors in these times of uncertainty. We chose to focus on the emotional toll of the situation on the clinician, protecting vulnerable persons, reckoning with social isolation, and promoting wellness during this crisis. At the same time, the last part of this document deals with the &quot;light at the end of the tunnel,&quot; discussing potential opportunities, lessons learned, and the positives that can come out of this crisis.","Dort, Romanelli, Choudhury, Flink, Lak, Levy, Needleman, Paget, Telem, Schwarz, Zhang, Sylla, Mellinger, Matthews, Feldman, Pryor, Asbun","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-020-07631-3","20200609","Burnout; COVID-19; Pandemic well-being; Surgeon wellness; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Fear; Forecasting; Guidelines as Topic; Health Personnel; Health Promotion; Humans; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Stress, Psychological; Surgeons; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Turkey's response to COVID-19 in terms of mental health","Coronavirus disease (also known as COVID-19) continues to spread throughout the world. In Turkey, which has a strong health system, most hospitals have been turned into pandemic hospitals, elective procedures have been postponed, and doctors have been reassigned to treat COVID-19. Efforts to limit spread of COVID-19 have been effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19. Behind this success was not only the intrinsic strength of the health system but also the strict changes in everyday life wrought by the crisis. It is an inescapable fact that these new measures, such as the imposition of curfew and lockdown, have had a significant effect on the mental health of the general population. Anxiety caused by COVID-19 has spread to the mental state of everyone. Although coronavirus-related diseases will end soon, it is predicted that serious psychiatric disorders will be a lasting consequence of the pandemic. Despite the many negatives brought by COVID-19, it has led to a positive unity between the public and healthcare professionals, and in spite of significant risks to their own health, healthcare workers have risen to the challenge of COVID-19.","Ã–ÄŸÃ¼tlÃ¼","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.57","20200611","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Turkey; children; pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The need for Early Intervention for Psychosis to persist throughout the covid-19 pandemic and beyond","In the last three decades, Early Intervention for psychosis services have been established worldwide and have resulted in superior symptomatic and functional outcomes for people affected by psychotic disorders. These improved outcomes are a result of reducing delays to treatment and the provision of specialized, holistic interventions. The covid-19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the delivery of these services, such as undetected cases or long delays to treatment. Furthermore, the covid-19 pandemic will likely increase the mental health needs of communities, including the incidence of psychotic disorders. In this perspective piece, we provide suggestions as to how early intervention for psychosis services can adapt within this environment, such as utilizing novel technologies. Finally, we argue that despite the economic consequences of the pandemic, the funding for mental health services, including early intervention services, should be increased in line with the need for these services during and beyond the pandemic.","O'Donoghue, O'Connor, Thompson, McGorry","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.56","20200521",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In forensic psychiatry and across all psychiatric services, urgent and clinically led responses have underlined redundancies and confusions in the governance of mental health services and a vacuum in policy makers. For the future, a greater emphasis on services for patients with schizophrenia and other severe, enduring mental disorders must aim at reducing standardised mortality ratios, managing risk of violence and improving hard outcomes such as symptomatic remission, functional recovery and forensic recovery of autonomy. This will require more use of information technology at service level and at national level where Scandinavian-style population based data linkage research must now become legally sanctioned and necessary.

In ADMiRE, there has been a significant reduction of face to face consultations, postponement of new assessments, difficulties with physical monitoring, delays in medication initiation, suspension of medication titration, lack of group interventions and problems with access to controlled drug prescriptions. Current guidelines and alternative ways of ensuring adequate service provision are discussed.Restrictions to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 are likely to continue for many months, and child and adolescent mental health services need to find new ways to provide a sustainable service to young people in Ireland. There is a growing evidence base for telepsychiatry, the use of technology such as video conferencing to deliver mental health care remotely, and this approach may be particularly useful in assessment and management of ADHD.

"The challenges of COVID-19 for community pharmacists and opportunities for the future","Pharmacists, like psychiatrists, have modified their practices amidst COVID-19 in order to guarantee care and support to their patients. Designated an essential frontline service, community pharmacists are facing a spectrum of challenges to surmount to ensure patient care continues. These include assisting in the prevention of infection, managing supply chains, preventing stockpiling and provision of evidence-based medical information. However, disasters like COVID-19 disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable populations, and patients with mental health conditions may be among the hardest hit. Pharmacist-level, system-level and regulatory responses have sought to minimise this impact, although there is likely to be a lasting impression on the profession, both good and bad.

"Covid-19, child and adolescent mental health - Croatian (in)experience","The Covid-19 pandemic has caused unseen socio-economic changes all over the world, where enormous efforts are being made to preserve lives and maintain functional health systems. A secondary concern is to mitigate the severe economic consequences of the crisis. Different approaches have been adopted with varying outcomes and experiences. But regardless of the different approaches taken, one thing is common for all societies during this pandemic: fear and anxiety. This fear extends from concerns about the present situation, for the health and well-being of family members and loved ones from Covid-19 infection, to fears relating to how long the crisis will last, to the potential economic consequences of the pandemic (perhaps not seen in our lifetimes) and the ultimate fear of future uncertainty. Across the world, health systems are being faced with unprecedented challenges. At their core, these challenges are the same: how to beat Covid-19. Certainly, there are differences in how individual systems are organized and how they address the main issues arising from the pandemic while not forgetting the ongoing healthcare needs of the general population. In this paper, we share some perspectives from Croatia regarding Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHs) in these extraordinary circumstances.

As a species more fragile than we often allow, humans would be expected to adversely react to these types of disasters in terms of mental ill health and possibly suicidal behaviour leading to increased demands on the Mental Health services. This narrative historical paper examines relevant studies into how previous disasters affected mental health and suicidal behaviour. The characteristics of what is known of the current Covid-19 disease are analysed and compared to other types of disasters with a view to gaining some insight into what we might expect. Of all the types of disasters, economic recession appears most toxic. Mitigating the worst effects of recession appears to be protective.

The mental health impact of this pandemic cannot be underestimated, particularly relating to patients suffering from addiction. Heightened public stress and anxiety levels, increasing isolation and the physical consequences of addiction play a large role in the proliferation and ongoing relapse of substance misuse and behavioural addiction. Service provision is an ongoing challenge not only due to the increasing need for services given the increased mental health burden of COVID-19 but also the restrictions in place in clinical areas to achieve social distancing. The necessary adaptations to service provision provide opportunities for the analysis of current processes used in our addiction unit and the introduction of new processes to our service.

In this ongoing pandemic, public health concerns and the urgent need for effective therapeutic measures require a deep understanding of the epidemiology, transmissibility and pathogenesis of COVID-19. Here we analysed clinical, molecular and immunological data from 326 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shanghai. The genomic sequences of SARS-CoV-2, assembled from 112 high-quality samples together with sequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) dataset, showed a stable evolution and suggested that there were two major lineages with differential exposure history during the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan. Nevertheless, they exhibited similar virulence and clinical outcomes. Lymphocytopenia, especially reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts upon hospital admission, was predictive of disease progression. High levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 during treatment were observed in patients with severe or critical disease and correlated with decreased lymphocyte count. The determinants of disease severity seemed to stem mostly from host factors such as age and lymphocytopenia (and its associated cytokine storm), whereas viral genetic variation did not significantly affect outcomes.","Zhang, Tan, Ling, Lu, Liu, Yi, Jia, Wu, Shi, Xu, Chen, Wang, Chen, Jiang, Yu, Lu, Wang, Xu, Yuan, Zhang, Zhang, Zhao, Wang, Chen, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2355-0","20200721","Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Animals; Asymptomatic Infections; Betacoronavirus; China; Cohort Studies; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Illness; Disease Progression; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Hospitalization; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Interleukin-6; Interleukin-8; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphopenia; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Phylogeny; Pneumonia, Viral; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Adult; T-Lymphocytes; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Virulence; Virus Shedding; Young Adult; Zoonoses","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia. Results may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies and implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties.","Voitsidis, Gliatas, Bairachtari, Papadopoulou, Papageorgiou, Parlapani, Syngelakis, Holeva, Diakogiannis","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113076","20200605","Loneliness; Sleep; Uncertainty; Worry","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The sequential course of the crisis, the viral agent which acts as a triggering factor and the host of reactions which follow can thus evoke a suicidal crisis during which a subject often perceives an external event as a precipitating factor. However, unlike confinement in the case of the virus, it is the relationship, in particular the therapeutic relationship, which makes it possible to get through the crisis.

"Precision Physical Distancing for COVID-19: An Important Tool in Unlocking the Lockdown","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to the more routine public health measures, many countries have implemented &quot;lockdowns&quot;-closing borders, restricting international travel, and placing severe limitations on individual movement and group gatherings. While lockdowns may be an important tool to limit transmission, they come at a potentially great cost with regard to economic impact, mental health consequences, and increased morbidity and mortality from non-COVID-19 diseases. Furthermore, implementation of the required draconian measures may be difficult in some settings because of logistical, economic, and sociocultural impediments, especially in many low- and middle-income countries. Governments and health authorities must chart a course on how to &quot;unlock&quot; or control transmission where lockdowns are not feasible. &quot;Precision physical distancing&quot;-distancing tailored and optimized to specific physical, social, cultural, political, and economic contexts and to specific groups and settings-is proposed and discussed here as an important tool in the control of COVID-19. It has the advantages of being low cost, adaptable to diverse sociocultural and economic settings through community ownership and local action, and more easily monitored and potentially enforced than less precise measures. Precision physical distancing can be one important component of a sustainable long-term solution that is proportionate to the risk yet does not have a disproportionate impact on society and the economy, allowing a partial return to normal activities, with the community as an essential partner.","Bausch","https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-0359","20200720","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Quarantine; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic","We describe the basic principles of mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic that should be endorsed by the mental health professional associations and incorporated in the health strategies for the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main principle is that there should be no substantial differences in the provision of health care for COVID-19 between persons with pre-existing mental health disorders and the ones without previous disorders. Subsequently, the organization of the health care should reflect that as well. These principles should (a) prevent the possible effects of stigmatizing attitudes toward mental health issues, possibly leading to potentially deleterious situations, such as psychiatric patients being treated (even temporarily) separately from other patients, in psychiatric facilities, where the staff is not equipped and trained adequately for the management of COVID-19; (b) highlight the fact that patients with mental health disorders are at greater risk for developing serious complications of COVID-19 infection due to other factors-they often smoke and have comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, all associated with higher morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection; (c) highlight that measures should be taken to minimize the risk of the spread of infection in psychiatric wards/institutions; (d) provide a general framework for the reorganization of mental health services toward the provision of services for persons in need, including frontline medical workers and patients with COVID-19 without previous mental health problems as well as for persons with pre-existing mental health problems under new circumstances of pandemic.","Kuzman, Curkovic, Wasserman","https://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.54","20200608","COVID-19; mental health; organization; public health; stigma; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stereotyping","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF A PANDEMIC OUTBREAK ON MEDICAL STAFF - LITERATURE REVIEW]","In January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared an international emergency due to the outbreak of COVID-19. In March 2020 the WHO announced that the epidemic could be characterized as a pandemic. Subsequently, the WHO acknowledged the importance of providing support to the medical teams, realizing the enormous burden and stress facing this group. The aim of the present study is to review the up-to-date professional literature dealing with the psychological impact of a pandemic outbreak on medical staff. The literature existing so-far is scarce. It does, however, provide evidence of the short- and long-term impact of such epidemics on the mental health of the medical teams. Direct exposure to affected patients, the risk of contagion, a subjectively negative perception of one's medical condition and being in isolation or quarantine, all constitute risk factors for mental symptoms such as depression, anxiety and post-trauma. A sense of control, especially regarding the means of protection and controlling infection, altruistic acceptance of the work-related risks, social support, good team-spirit in the medical unit and support from superiors are all protective factors.","Shelef, Schiff, Zalsman","https://www.google.com/search?q=[THE+PSYCHOLOGICAL+IMPACT+OF+A+PANDEMIC+OUTBREAK+ON+MEDICAL+STAFF+-+LITERATURE+REVIEW].","20200521","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Medical Staff; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; World Health Organization","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH - LITERATURE REVIEW]","The spread of epidemics resulting in many deaths has been known since the dawn of civilization, for example, the typhus and smallpox epidemics and the plague. Early in the previous century there was an outbreak of the Spanish Flue and towards the end of the 60's, the AIDS epidemic (HIV). Since the start of the current century, several epidemics broke out and spread to various places around the world, for instance, SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the Avian Influenza and the Swine Influenza. In 2014 there was an outbreak of Ebola (Ebola virus disease) and in 2015 the Zika virus emerged and there were more. Epidemics cause havoc and impact all areas of life. Each epidemic takes an unfathomable price in lives. It is estimated, for example, that the AIDS epidemic took the lives of some 30 million people. The Corona virus (Covid-19) broke out in China, towards the end of 2019 and spread to most parts of the world. The implications of the outbreak are similar in many countries, among others, due to the uncertainty regarding the way the virus spreads, the appropriate treatment, the lack of vaccination and the high rate of deaths. Naturally, at such times physical protection is a top priority. However, coping with the implications to people's mental health is no less important and these may result in long-term negative impacts.","Shelef, Zalsman","https://www.google.com/search?q=[THE+PSYCHOLOGICAL+IMPACT+OF+COVID-19+ON+MENTAL+HEALTH+-+LITERATURE+REVIEW].","20200521","Animals; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; HIV; Humans; Mental Health; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The prevalence and influencing factors in anxiety in medical workers fighting COVID-19 in China: a cross-sectional survey","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2 virus) has been sustained in China since December 2019, and has become a pandemic. The mental health of frontline medical staff is a concern. In this study, we aimed to identify the factors influencing medical worker anxiety in China during the COVID-19 outbreak. We conducted a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among medical staff in China from 10 February 2020 to 20 February 2020 using the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) to assess anxiety, with the criteria of normal (â©½49), mild (50-59), moderate (60-70) and severe anxiety (â©¾70). We used multivariable linear regression to determine the factors (e.g. having direct contact when treating infected patients, being a medical staff worker from Hubei province, being a suspect case) for anxiety. We also used adjusted models to confirm independent factors for anxiety after adjusting for gender, age, education and marital status. Of 512 medical staff in China, 164 (32.03%) had had direct contact treating infected patients. The prevalence of anxiety was 12.5%, with 53 workers suffering from mild (10.35%), seven workers suffering from moderate (1.36%) and four workers suffering from severe anxiety (0.78%). After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (gender, age, education and marital status), medical staff who had had direct contact treating infected patients experienced higher anxiety scores than those who had not had direct contact (Î² value = 2.33, confidence interval (CI) 0.65-4.00; P = 0.0068). A similar trend was observed in medical staff from Hubei province, compared with those from other parts of China (Î² value = 3.67, CI 1.44-5.89; P = 0.0013). The most important variable was suspect cases with high anxiety scores, compared to non-suspect cases (Î² value = 4.44, CI 1.55-7.33; P = 0.0028). In this survey of hospital medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, we found that study participants experienced anxiety symptoms, especially those who had direct clinical contact with infected patients; as did those in the worst affected areas, including Hubei province; and those who were suspect cases. Governments and healthcare authorities should proactively implement appropriate psychological intervention programmes, to prevent, alleviate or treat increased anxiety.","Liu, Yang, Zhang, Xu, Dou, Zhang, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0950268820001107","20200529","Anxiety; COVID-19; medical workers; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pandemics; Personnel, Hospital; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Neurosurgeons worldwide are affected in different ways. This is the first study regarding the readiness of neurosurgery residents for the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact. The aim is to identify the level of knowledge and readiness and the impact of this virus among neurosurgery residents in different programs. A cross-sectional analysis was performed in which 52 neurosurgery residents from different centers were selected to complete a questionnaire-based survey. The questionnaire comprised 3 sections and 27 questions that ranged from knowledge to impact of the pandemic on various features. The median knowledge score was 4 out of 5. The proportion of participants with a satisfactory level of knowledge was 60%. There was a statistically significant difference between the knowledge score and location of the program. Around 48% of the neurosurgery residents dealt directly with patients with COVID-19. Receiving a session about personal protective equipment was reported by 57.7%. Neurosurgery training at the hospital was affected. About 90% believed that this pandemic had influenced their mental health. Neurosurgery residents have a relatively good knowledge about COVID-19. The location of the program was associated with knowledge level. Most participants did not receive sufficient training about personal protective equipment. Almost all responders agreed that their training at the hospital had been affected. Further studies are needed to study the impact of this pandemic on neurosurgery residents.","Alhaj, Al-Saadi, Mohammad, Alabri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.05.087","20200721","Coronavirus (COVID-19); Impact; Knowledge; Neurosurgery residents; Practice","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

COVID-19 also has indirect effects from the lockdown and the possible lack of food. We aimed to evaluate the perception of this in Celiac Disease (CeD) patients who require a lifelong gluten-free diet as a therapy. We invited by e-mail CeD adult patients from the University of Salerno (Campania, South Italy) and the University of Padua (Veneto, North Italy) to answer an <i>ad hoc</i> COVID-19 survey. We sent the web survey to 651 email addresses and we received 276 answers (42,4%). CeD patients did not feel more vulnerable because they had CeD <i>(not at all</i> 56.6%)and they did not worry much about the possible shortness of gluten-free food during the epidemic(<i>not at all 48.5%)</i>The most worried were the elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities and females. Finally, CeD patients were happy with remote consultations and explicitly asked to have them. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted a proportion of patients with CeD; in particular, women, elderly patients, patients with other comorbidities. COVID-19, although a challenging experience from the medical and the psychological point of view, has offered an opportunity to practice, on a large-scale, a remote consultation approach for CeD healthcare.","Siniscalchi, Zingone, Savarino, D'Odorico, Ciacci","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dld.2020.05.014","20200522","Anxiety; COVID-19; Celiac disease; Gluten-free diet; depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Minimal Access Gardening: Laparoscopic Techniques during Coronavirus Disease Lockdown","To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of &quot;cup feeding&quot; is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.","Ma","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2020.05.004","20200615","A bit of fun; Education; Gardening; Laparoscopy; Practice; Tongue in cheek submission; Weed","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Strategies to Promote Social Connections Among Older Adults During 'Social Distancing' Restrictions","Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for corona virus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, we describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a 'Connections Plan' to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during 'social distancing' restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a 'Safety Plan' for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.","Van Orden, Bower, Lutz, Silva, Gallegos, Podgorski, Santos, Conwell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.004","20200627","COVID-19; Loneliness; Social Isolation; cognitive behavioral therapy; psychotherapy; social connections","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (nÂ =Â 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression.

We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a &quot;brief reactive psychosis (298.8)&quot; under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.","Anmella, Fico, Roca, GÃ³mez-Ramiro, VÃ¡zquez, Murru, Pacchiarotti, Verdolini, Vieta","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061","20200707","Brief psychotic disorder; Brief reactive psychosis; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare professional; Mental health; Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotic Disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Lessons from Hurricane Katrina for predicting the indirect health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic","Beyond their immediate effects on mortality, disasters have widespread, indirect impacts on mental and physical well-being by exposing survivors to stress and potential trauma. Identifying the disaster-related stressors that predict health adversity will help officials prepare for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using data from a prospective study of young, low-income mothers who survived Hurricane Katrina, we find that bereavement, fearing for loved ones' well-being, and lacking access to medical care and medications predict adverse mental and physical health 1 y postdisaster, and some effects persist 12 y later. Adjusting for preexisting health and socioeconomic conditions attenuates, but does not eliminate, these associations. The findings, while drawn from a demographically unique sample, suggest that, to mitigate the indirect effects of COVID-19, lapses in medical care and medication use must be minimized, and public health resources should be directed to those with preexisting medical conditions, their social networks, and the bereaved.","Raker, Zacher, Lowe","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006706117","20200618","COVID-19 pandemic; Hurricane Katrina; disasters; mental health; physical health; Adolescent; Bereavement; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cyclonic Storms; Disasters; Fear; Health Services Accessibility; Health Status; Humans; Mental Health; Mothers; New Orleans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Poverty; Prospective Studies; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Cadaveric Simulation of Endoscopic Endonasal Procedures: Analysis of Droplet Splatter Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The primary mode of viral transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to occur through the spread of respiratory droplets. The objective of this study was to investigate droplet and splatter patterns resulting from common endoscopic endonasal procedures. Cadaver simulation series. Dedicated surgical laboratory. After instilling cadaver head specimens (n = 2) with fluorescein solution, endoscopic endonasal procedures were systematically performed to evaluate the quantity, size, and distance of droplets and splatter following each experimental condition. There were no observable fluorescein droplets or splatter noted in the measured surgical field in any direction after nasal endoscopy, septoplasty with microdebrider-assisted turbinoplasty, cold-steel functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS), and all experimental conditions using an ultrasonic aspirator. Limited droplet spread was noted with microdebrider FESS (2 droplets, &lt;1 mm in size, within 10 cm), drilling of the sphenoid rostrum with a diamond burr (8, &lt;1 mm, 12 cm), and drilling of the frontal beak with a cutting burr (5, &lt;1 mm, 9 cm); however, the use of concurrent suction while drilling resulted in no droplets or splatter. The control condition of external activation of the drill resulted in gross contamination (11, 2 cm, 13 cm). Our results indicate that there is very little droplet generation from routine rhinologic procedures. The droplet generation from drilling was mitigated with the use of concurrent suction. Extreme caution should be used to avoid activating powered instrumentation outside of the nasal cavity, which was found to cause droplet contamination.","Sharma, Rubel, Ye, Shipchandler, Wu, Higgins, Burgin, Ting, Illing","https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599820929274","20200715","COVID-19; droplet; nasal endoscopy; sinus surgery; skull base surgery; splatter; Betacoronavirus; Cadaver; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Endoscopy; Humans; Nose Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rhinoplasty; Simulation Training; Treatment Outcome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Our objective was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on somatic symptoms among Chinese college and primary school students, to provide reference data pertaining to the mental health of this population in the context of a public health emergency. In February and March 2020, we explored the somatic symptoms and concerns regarding COVID-19 of 399 college and primary school students in Sichuan Province using the Somatic Self-rating Scale (SSS) and a novel questionnaire, respectively. Logistic regression analysis and non-parametric tests were used to analyze the data. The incidence of somatic symptoms among college students was 34.85 (mild, 26.26%; moderate, 8.59%). The incidence of somatic symptoms in primary school students was 2.39% (all mild). Among the entire cohort, concern regarding COVID-19 was positively correlated with the occurrence of somatic symptoms. Somatic symptoms were more likely among college students expressing greater concern regarding the threat to life and health posed by COVID-19, and the efficacy of prevention and control measures. Among primary school students, only the concern for life and health was associated with a higher likelihood of somatic symptoms.

"Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance","As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and &quot;staying at home&quot; to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the 'lockdown' situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

"The 5% of the Population at High Risk for Severe COVID-19 Infection Is Identifiable and Needs to Be Taken Into Account When Reopening the Economy","The goal of this column is to help mental health care professionals understand coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so that they can better explain the complexities of the current crisis to their patients. The bottom-line of this column is that, while COVID-19 can infect virtually everyone in the human population, only about 5% are susceptible to severe infection requiring admission to an intensive care unit and/or causing a fatal outcome and this population can be identified on the basis of comorbid medical illness and/or age. These numbers are based on experience in China, the United States, and Europe. Table 1 presents an analysis conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which is further supported by several other sources reviewed in the article. The population at risk for severe infection are individuals with comorbid medical illness and those 85 years of age and older. The comorbid medical illnesses identified as risk factors are preexisting respiratory and cardiovascular disease, immunocompromised status, morbid obesity (ie, body mass index â‰¥40), diabetes mellitus, and possibly significant kidney or liver impairment. Parenthetically, news reports and the literature sometimes cite age 60 years and older as a risk factor but age between 60 and 85 years is likely a surrogate for having 1 or more of these comorbid medical conditions. While 5% may initially seem like a small number, it nevertheless potentially represents 16.5 million people, given the United States population of 330 million. That is a tremendous number of people requiring intensive care unit admission and/or potentially dying, and individuals in this population have overwhelmed the US health care system in some hotspots. For this reason, this column suggests taking this at-risk population into account in mitigation strategies when attempting to open the US economy. The column addresses the following questions: (1) What are the 3 aspects of the race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19? (2) What data are currently available to help guide decisions to be made? (3) What strategies have been employed to date and how successful have they been? and (4) Might risk stratification of exposure be a viable strategy to minimize the damage caused by the virus? The race to minimize the damage caused by COVID-19 requires that we obtain knowledge about the disease and its treatment or prevention, how to best safeguard public health and avoid overwhelming the health care system, and how to minimize the societal damage caused by substantial disruption of the economy. Data gathered over the past 4 months since the COVID-19 virus emerged as a human pathogen have provided guidance for our decisions going forward. The most widely adopted strategies for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic to date have involved the epidemiological approach of encouraging good hygiene practices and social distancing, including orders to &quot;shelter in place,&quot; quarantine of high-risk individuals, and isolation of infected individuals. The goal of this epidemiological approach has been to &quot;flatten the curve&quot; by reducing the height of the peak of the infection to avoid overwhelming the health care system and society in general, while buying time to learn more about the disease and find more effective ways to deal with it. However, now that more is known about COVID-19 and the portion of the population that is most at risk for serious adverse outcomes including death, it may be possible to move from a shelter-in-place approach for the entire population to focus on those at most risk and thus facilitate a gradual and rational phased reduction of social restrictions to reopen the economy. Such a graduated opening would be based on regions of countries meeting specific criteria in terms of being able to contain the virus, coupled with vigorous monitoring to look for outbreaks, followed by case monitoring, isolation of infected individuals and quarantine of exposed individuals, and increased use of testing for active disease as well as for immunity. Taking the data on high-risk individuals into account would allow for a gradual lifting of restrictions on the majority of the population while maintaining more stringent safeguards to protect the vulnerable portion of the population. Nevertheless, the entire population would need to continue to practice good hygiene and social distancing while simultaneously-and perhaps even more vigorously-focusing on sheltering the vulnerable population until adequate community immunity has been achieved to prevent the spread of the virus, whether that is accomplished through natural exposure alone or with the addition of safe and effective vaccine(s) which may not be available for a year. Continued widespread testing for antibodies will help determine how far or close this country is-and other countries are-from developing effective community immunity.","Preskorn","https://doi.org/10.1097/PRA.0000000000000475","20200529","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; China; Commerce; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Economics; Humans; Infection Control; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Public Policy; Quarantine; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Covid-19 pandemic impact on mental health: a web-based cross-sectional survey on a sample of Italian general practitioners","Since the World Health Organization declared the new 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak first a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and then a pandemic, Italy held more than 195.350 cases and 26.380 deaths. Working in the frontline with suspected Covid-19 infection patients, general practitioners (GPs) are daily under both physical and psychological pressure.Â Methods: A web-based cross-sectional survey was carried out on italian GPs working in Genoa (Italy), to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health. The survey was anonymous and a free Google FormsÂ® software was used. One hundred thirty-one GPs completed the survey. Compared to GPs with absent or mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 &lt; 10), GPs reporting moderate to severe depressive symptoms (N=30, 22.9%; PHQ-9 â‰¥ 10) reported more helplessness (96.7% vs. 79.2%, p=.025), spent more than three hours searching for COVID-19 information (43.3% vs. 19.8%, p=.024), perceived less adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) (6.7% vs. 23.8%, p=.049) and visited more COVID-19 infected patients (16.63 Â± 27.30 vs. 9.52 Â± 11.75, p=.041). Moreover, PHQ-9 â‰¥ 10 GPs reported a significant higher severity for both anxiety and insomnia (13.43 Â± 4.96 vs. 4.88 Â± 3.53 and 11.60 Â± 5.53 vs. 4.84 Â± 3.81, respectively; p&lt;.001), and a worse quality of life in both mental (34.60 Â± 7.45 vs. 46.01 Â± 7.83, p&lt;.001) and physical (43.50 Â± 9.37 vs. 52.94 Â± 4.78, p&lt;.001) component summary. Our results give early insight into the urgent need to provide continuity of care for patients at the community-level, adequate PPE to GPs and a clear guidance from public health institutions.

"Clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia who were suspected to have coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Hubei Province, China","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, no data have been available for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have COVID-19. We performed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical features of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with or without suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. To explore the clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 in Hubei Province, China. 21 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia with suspected COVID-19 (COVID-19 suspected group) in the isolation ward of a mental health hospital in Wuhan and 30 hospitalised patients with schizophrenia (clean group) in the general ward of another mental health hospital in Yichang were recruited. We retrospectively reviewed their clinical characteristics, laboratory findings and chest CT results before 21 February 2020. We also compared the emotional and mental symptoms between the two groups. Medical records revealed that 21 COVID-19 suspected patients were transferred to the isolation ward between 30 January 2020 and 15 February 2020. The mean age (SD) of COVID-19 suspected patients was 43.1 (2.6). 12 (57.1%) patients showed abnormalities on chest CT before onset of respiratory symptoms. 14 (66.7%) patients had psychiatric medications adjustment after detection of abnormal chest CT findings. By 21 February, one patient was confirmed to have COVID-19. Even though the remaining 20 (95.2%) were negative for at least two reverse transcription PCR tests, 11 (52.4%) patients met the diagnostic criteria for clinically confirmed cases. Compared with patients in the clean group, patients in the suspected COVID-19 group showed significantly higher stress, depression and anxiety levels and poorer sleep quality. Setting up an independent isolation ward for hospitalised psychiatric patients who are suspected to have symptoms of COVID-19 helped control the spread of the epidemic. Patients with schizophrenia suspected to have COVID-19 showed increased stress and mood and sleep disturbances, which should be appropriately managed.","Liu, Lin, Jiang, Li, Zhong, Su, Li, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100222","20200522","cross-sectional studies; epidemiological monitoring; schizophrenia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Challenges and burden of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for child and adolescent mental health: a narrative review to highlight clinical and research needs in the acute phase and the long return to normality","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting life around the globe. Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly. Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits. Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns. Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment. Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time. To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents. Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, including-but not restricted to-child maltreatment. The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry. There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized. Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.","Fegert, Vitiello, Plener, Clemens","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00329-3","20200522","Adolescents; Adverse childhood experiences; Children; Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Domestic violence family; Economic hardship; Mental health; Pandemic; Recession; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Bereavement in the Time of Coronavirus: Unprecedented Challenges Demand Novel Interventions","COVID-19 fatalities exemplify &quot;bad deaths&quot; and are distinguished by physical discomfort, difficulty breathing, social isolation, psychological distress, and care that may be discordant with the patient's preferences. Each of these death attributes is a well-documented correlate of bereaved survivors' symptoms of depression, anxiety, and anger. Yet the grief experienced by survivors of COVID-related deaths is compounded by the erosion of coping resources like social support, contemporaneous stressors including social isolation, financial precarity, uncertainty about the future, lack of routine, and the loss of face-to-face mourning rituals that provide a sense of community and uplift. National efforts to enhance advance care planning may help dying patients to receive care that is concordant with the preferences of them and their families.

"Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depressive symptoms in pregnant women: a preliminary study","<b>Objective:</b> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak that began in China has turned into a pandemic that threatens global health, thereby prompting the concentration of studies and clinical routines on treating and preventing the disease. However, research on the psychological effects of the pandemic on the general population, particularly pregnant women, is lacking. Accordingly, the present study investigated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression and anxiety in pregnant women.<b>Study design:</b> An anonymous survey for assessing depression and anxiety in pregnant women was designed, after which a link to the online questionnaire was sent to the participants, who were being treated in a private medical center. One of the researchers followed up with the respondents, among whom 260 returned their questionnaires.<b>Results:</b> Among the respondents, 35.4% (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰92, case group) obtained scores higher than 13 on the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale <b>(</b>EPDS). The comparison of the groups by years of education indicated statistically significant effects of COVID-19 on psychology, social isolation, and mean scores in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). These effects were more severe in the case group than in the control group (psychology: 8.369â€‰Â±â€‰2.003, social isolation: 8.000â€‰Â±â€‰2.507, mean BDI and BAI scores: 20.565â€‰Â±â€‰6.605 and 22.087â€‰Â±â€‰8.689, respectively). A regression analysis revealed that the BDI scores and the disease's psychological effects, as well as the BAI scores and the illness's social isolation effects, exerted a statistically significant influence on the EPDS scores of the participants.<b>Conclusion:</b> This study illustrated the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the depression and anxiety levels of pregnant women. Our results point to an urgent need to provide psychosocial support to this population during the crisis. Otherwise, adverse events may occur during pregnancy and thus affect both mother and fetus.","DurankuÅŸ, Aksu","https://doi.org/10.1080/14767058.2020.1763946","20200518","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; pandemic; pregnancy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Pathogenicity of a QX-like avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated in China","Avian infectious bronchitis is a serious and highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 10<sup>5.5</sup> EID<sub>50</sub> exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect. In conclusion, the IBV strain is a virulent avian IBV and that exhibited severe pathogenicity in chickens and is a vaccine candidate to prevent infection by Chinese QX-like nephropathogenic IBV strains.","Ren, Liu, Huang, Li, Shang, Liang, Luo, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3382/ps/pez568","20200621","QX-like type; avian infectious bronchitis; pathogenicity","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: A mixed-method study","Since the end of 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUANÂ +Â QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and withinÂ Â±Â three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), anxiety (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PÂ &lt;Â 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of &quot;Perceived Helplessness&quot;, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (ZÂ =Â 2.56, PÂ =Â 0.010), female (ZÂ =Â 2.37, PÂ =Â 0.018) and male controls (ZÂ =Â 2.87, PÂ =Â 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (RÂ =Â 0.37, PÂ =Â 0.003, Spearman's correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (RÂ =Â -0.31, PÂ =Â 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.","Guo, Zheng, Shi, Wang, Li, Li, Fromson, Xu, Liu, Xu, Zhang, Lu, Chen, Hu, Tang, Yang, Zhou, Wang, Chen, Wang, Yang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038","20200605","COVID-19; Depression; Mixed-method; Peripheral inflammation; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Subjective neurological symptoms frequently occur in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome &quot;Tor Vergata&quot;, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2Â days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7Â days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms are present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.","Liguori, Pierantozzi, Spanetta, Sarmati, Cesta, Iannetta, Ora, Mina, Puxeddu, Balbi, Pezzuto, Magrini, Rogliani, Andreoni, Mercuri","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037","20200607","COVID-19; Central nervous system; Daytime sleepiness; Dysgeusia; Hyposmia; Neurological symptoms; Neurology; SARS-CoV2 infection; Sex; Sleep impairment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Exposure to coronavirus news on mainstream media: The role of risk perceptions and depression","The mainstream media tend to rely on news content that will increase risk perceptions of pandemic outbreaks to stimulate public response and persuade people to comply with preventive behaviours. The objective of this study was to examine associations between exposure to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) news, risk perceptions, and depressive symptoms. Cross-sectional data were collected from 501 participants who were â‰¥18 years. Exposure to COVID-19 news was assessed as our exposure variable. We screened for depression (outcome variable) with the Patient Health Questionnaire and examined the roles of risk perceptions. Multiple linear regressions and mediation analysis with 1000 bootstrap resamples were conducted. Participants were 55.29% female, 67.86% White with mean age 32.44 Â± 11.94 years. After controlling for sociodemographic and socio-economic factors, news exposure was positively associated with depressive symptoms Î² = .11; 95% confidence interval (95%CI) = 0.02-0.20. Mediation analysis showed that perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 mediated 34.4% of this relationship (Î² = .04; 95%CI = 0.01-0.06). Perceived vulnerability to COVID-19 can serve as a pathway through which exposure to COVID-19 news on mainstream media may be associated with depressive symptoms.

"Posttraumatic stress symptoms of health care workers during the corona virus disease 2019","Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has attracted worldwide attention. The COVID-19 outbreak is unique in its rapid transmission and results in heavy stress for the front-line health care workers (HCWs). The current study aimed to exam posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs) of HCWs fighting for the COVID-19 and to evaluate their sleep quality after 1-month stressful suffering. Three hundred seventy-seven HCWs working in different provinces of China participated in the survey between February 1 and 5. The demographic information was collected first. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure PTSSs and sleep quality. Results showed that 1 month after the outbreak, the prevalence of PTSSs was 3.8% in HCWs. Female HCWs were more vulnerable to PTSSs with hazard ratio of 2.136 (95% CI = 1.388-3.286). HCWs with higher exposure level also significantly rated more hyperarousal symptoms (hazard ratio = 4.026, 95% CI = 1.233-13.140). There was a significant difference of sleep quality between participants with and without PTSSs (z value = 6.014, p &lt; .001) and among different groups with various contact frequencies (chi-square = 7.307, p = .026). Path analysis showed that there was a significant indirect effect from exposure level to PTSSs through sleep quality (coefficient = 1.750, 95% CI of Boostroop test = 0.543-2.998). In summary, targeted interventions on sleep contribute to the mental recovery during the outbreak of COVID-19. Understanding the mental health response after a public health emergency might help HCWs and communities prepare for a population's response to disaster.","Yin, Sun, Liu, Ni, Deng, Jia, Shang, Zhou, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2477","20200625","COVID-19; PTSD; health care workers (HCWs); psychological guidance; sleep quality; Adolescent; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Oncology services in corona times: a flash interview among German cancer patients and their physicians","Public discussion and health-care systems worldwide have been focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic. Does it have an impact on cancer care today? The PRIO (&quot;Prevention and Integrative Oncology&quot;) Working Group (German Cancer Society) has initiated an online survey for physicians, medical staff and patients on April 16, 2020. Between April 16 and April 19, 47 doctors and 146 patients filled in the questionnaires. The survey is ongoing. We present the first data. A majority of German patients (76%) and physicians (71%) report moderate or high restriction in their daily life. A minority (patients 25%, physicians 13%) was not worried that necessary treatments or diagnostics were restricted. Organizing cancer care needs more time and efforts for 56% of all reporting doctors. 98% of all oncologists think that restriction of family visits has a negative impact on the mental health of cancer patients. Half of all participants (patients 43%, physicians 47%) expect negative consequences on the physical status of our patients. Patients feel the existing emotional stress in 34% of their physicians. 52% of physicians fear mental and/or physical longtime consequences for themselves. There is a high level of mental and physical stress triggered by the present COVID-19 management. After only a few weeks, human resources are limited. They will be the most important key for further health-care services for patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.","BÃ¼ntzel, Klein, Keinki, Walter, BÃ¼ntzel, HÃ¼bner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00432-020-03249-z","20200519",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 in Africa: care and protection for frontline healthcare workers","Medical staff caring for COVID-19 patients face mental stress, physical exhaustion, separation from families, stigma, and the pain of losing patients and colleagues. Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is 'physical distancing' in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk 'allowances' or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic's trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic's potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.","Chersich, Gray, Fairlie, Eichbaum, Mayhew, Allwood, English, Scorgie, Luchters, Simpson, Haghighi, Pham, Rees","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00574-3","20200521","Africa; COVID-19; Healthcare workers; Human resources for health; Infection control, mental health; SARS-Cov-2; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Health Personnel; Humans; Infection Control; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Mental Health; Occupational Exposure; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Unrealistic Optimism in the Time of Coronavirus Pandemic: May It Help to Kill, If So-Whom: Disease or the Person?","<b>Objective</b>: The results of numerous empirical studies have showed the occurrence of so-called unrealistic optimism. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether in the situation of an imminent coronavirus pandemic, people would still perceive themselves as being less exposed to the disease than others. <b>Method</b><b>s</b>: Survey studies were conducted to examine the level of unrealistic optimism. Participants (<i>n</i> = 171, 67.3% of women) in a subjective way judged the risk of their coronavirus infection and the likelihood that this would happen to an average student of the same sex from their class. The survey was conducted in three waves: prior to the announcement of the first case of coronavirus (2-3 March), immediately after that announcement (5-6 March), and a few days later (9-10 March). <b>Results</b>: We showed that women estimated the chances of being infected as significantly higher (<i>M</i> = 4.52, <i>SD</i> = 2.079; <i>t</i> = 2.387; <i>p</i> = 0.018; <i>Cohen's d</i> = 0.393) than men (<i>M</i> = 3.71, <i>SD</i> = 2.042). The phenomenon of unrealistic optimism was observed especially in men (as compared to other male participants) as it appeared in all three measures (<i>M</i> (you) = 3.95 vs. <i>M</i> (other male student) = 4.63; <i>M</i> = 3.71 vs. <i>M</i> = 4.68, and <i>M</i> = 4.46 vs. <i>M</i> = 5.38 in phase one, two, and three, respectively; <i>p</i> 0.006 for all comparison), but also in women in the last two measures (<i>M</i>(you) = 4.55 vs. <i>M</i> (other female student) = 4.95<i>,</i> and <i>M</i> = 4.99 vs. <i>M</i> = 5.38 in phase 2 and 3, respectively; <i>p</i> 0.012 for both comparisons). <b>Conclusions</b>: The study revealed a fairly general occurrence of unrealistic optimism, which was mainly observed in men as it appeared in all three measures, but also in women in the last two measures. This result is important for health experts who are responsible for making people comply with regulations concerning social distancing, putting masks on to stop infection, and staying at home. It is possible that unrealistically optimistic people will behave much less in line with the aforementioned recommendations, causing coronavirus to spread widely.","Dolinski, Dolinska, Zmaczynska-Witek, Banach, Kulesza","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9051464","20200619","healthy illusion; risk perception; threat and fear; unrealistic optimism; unrealistic pessimism","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health Interventions during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Conceptual Framework by Early Career Psychiatrists","The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the scarcity of evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and the potential interventions to tackle them. Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions. Still, further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.","Ransing, Adiukwu, Pereira-Sanchez, Ramalho, Orsolini, Teixeira, Gonzalez-Diaz, Pinto da Costa, Soler-Vidal, BytyÃ§i, El Hayek, Larnaout, Shalbafan, Syarif, Nofal, Kundadak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102085","20200605","COVID-19; Framework; Interventions; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Guidelines for TMS/tES clinical services and research through the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has broadly disrupted biomedical treatment and research including non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind.

Due to the rapid increase in the number of infections worldwide, the WHO in March 2020, declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. Historically, first coronavirus had surfaced in 1965 with symptoms of common cold. Since then five different strands of this virus have emerged, most lethal of them was the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which infected about eight thousand people, killing ten percent of them. The COVID-19 is not the most deadly pandemic world has ever witnessed as the Spanish influenza pandemic, during 1918-19, killed more than fifty million people. Indeed COVID-19 has turned out to be the most lethal of all coronaviruses as it has infected at least three million people killing more than two hundred thousands of them in the first 4 months of its spread. Many politicians and social scientists have dubbed the depression, being caused by COVID-19, worse than that caused by the Second World War.

"Global Sentiments Surrounding the COVID-19 Pandemic on Twitter: Analysis of Twitter Trends","With the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration and government-initiated actions against coronavirus disease (COVID-19), sentiments surrounding COVID-19 have evolved rapidly. This study aimed to examine worldwide trends of four emotions-fear, anger, sadness, and joy-and the narratives underlying those emotions during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 20 million social media twitter posts made during the early phases of the COVID-19 outbreak from January 28 to April 9, 2020, were collected using &quot;wuhan,&quot; &quot;corona,&quot; &quot;nCov,&quot; and &quot;covid&quot; as search keywords. Public emotions shifted strongly from fear to anger over the course of the pandemic, while sadness and joy also surfaced. Findings from word clouds suggest that fears around shortages of COVID-19 tests and medical supplies became increasingly widespread discussion points. Anger shifted from xenophobia at the beginning of the pandemic to discourse around the stay-at-home notices. Sadness was highlighted by the topics of losing friends and family members, while topics related to joy included words of gratitude and good health. Overall, global COVID-19 sentiments have shown rapid evolutions within just the span of a few weeks. Findings suggest that emotion-driven collective issues around shared public distress experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic are developing and include large-scale social isolation and the loss of human lives. The steady rise of societal concerns indicated by negative emotions needs to be monitored and controlled by complementing regular crisis communication with strategic public health communication that aims to balance public psychological wellbeing.","Lwin, Lu, Sheldenkar, Schulz, Shin, Gupta, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2196/19447","20200527","COVID-19; Twitter; emotions; infodemic; pandemic; social sentiments; Coronavirus Infections; Emotions; Humans; Internationality; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prevalence and Influencing Factors of Anxiety and Depression Symptoms in the First-Line Medical Staff Fighting Against COVID-19 in Gansu","The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has brought enormous physical and psychological pressure on Chinese medical staff. It is extremely important to understand the prevalence and influencing factors of anxiety and depression symptoms in first-line anti-epidemic medical staff and their coping styles for these negative emotions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in Gansu (China), with a questionnaire packet which consisted of the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and the simplified coping style questionnaire (SCSQ). A total of 79 doctors and 86 nurses participated in the survey. Correlation analysis was performed to explore the relationship between SAS, SDS, and SCSQ score. A linear regression model was used to determine the influencing factors for anxiety or depression symptoms. The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression symptoms among doctors was 11.4% and 45.6%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety (T=-2.644, p= 0.010, 95%CI: -10.514~-1.481) was shown to be a risk factor for anxiety symptoms in doctors, while being male (T=2.970, p=0.004, 95%CI: 2.667~13.521) was a protective factor for depression. The prevalence rate of anxiety and depression symptoms among nurses was 27.9% and 43.0%, respectively. History of depression or anxiety was a common risk factor for anxiety symptoms (T=-3.635, p=0.000, 95%CI: -16.360~-4.789) and depression symptoms (T=-2.835, p=0.005, 95%CI:-18.238~-3.254) in nurses. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the total score of positive coping was negatively correlated with the total score of anxiety (r=-0.182, p=0.002) and depression (r=-0.253, p=0.001). The first-line anti-epidemic medical staff have high anxiety and depression symptoms and adopting positive coping styles will help to improve their negative emotions.","Zhu, Sun, Zhang, Wang, Fan, Yang, Li, Xiao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00386","20200518","COVID-19; Chinese; anxiety; depression; medical staff","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Public Health Aspects of COVID-19 Infection with Focus on Cardiovascular Diseases","COVID-19 is the disease caused by an infection of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, first identified in the city of Wuhan, in China's Hubei province in December 2019. COVID-19 was previously known as 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) respiratory disease before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the official name as COVID-19 in February 2020. The aim of this study is to search scientific literature in the biomedicine and analyzed current results of investigations regarding morbidity and mortality rates as consequences of COVID-19 infection of Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and other most common chronic diseases which are on the top mortality and morbidity rates in almost all countries in the world. Also, to propose most useful measures how to prevent patients to keep themselves against COVID-19 infection. We used method of descriptive analysis of the published papers with described studies about Corona virus connected with CVD, and, also, Guidelines proposed by World Health Organization (WHO) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and some other international associations which are included in global fighting against COVID-19 infection. After searching current scientific literature we have acknowledged that not any Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) study in the world during last 5 months from the time when first cases of COVID-10 infection was detected. Also, there is no unique proposed ways of treatments and drugs to protect patients, especially people over 65 years old, who are very risk group to be affected with COVID-19. Expectations that vaccine against COVID-19 will be produced optimal during at least 10 months to 2 years, and in all current Guidelines most important proposed preventive measures are the same like which one described in Strategic documents of WHO, in statements of Declaration of Primary Health Care in Alma Ata in 1978. WHO proposed preventive measures can be helpful to everybody. Physicians who work at every level of Health Care Systems, but especially at primary health care level, must follow those recommendations and teach their patients about it. But, the fact is that current focus of COVID-19 epidemic has targeted on protection of physical health of population in global, however, the influence on mental health which will be one of the important consequences of COVID-19 pandemic in the future, and which could be declared as Â«Post-coronavirus Stress Syndrome&quot; (PCSS) could be bigger challenge for Global Public Health.","Masic, Naser, Zildzic","https://doi.org/10.5455/msm.2020.32.71-76","20200518","COVID-19; CVDs; Chronic diseases; Post-coronavirus Stress Syndrome - PCSS; Public health; WHO Guidelines","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Quarantine of the Covid-19 pandemic in suicide: A psychological autopsy","The epidemiology of suicide has identified numerous psychiatric and occupational risk factors. The circumstances surrounding a suicide are fundamental to determining whether its characteristics will play a crucial role in the decision-making process. The state of emergency arising from the Covid-19 pandemic has introduced a new element, given the general concern and feelings of alarm which are global. The most suitable forensic method to analyse these cases is the psychological autopsy. This study's purpose is to analyse the application of the psychological autopsy method to evaluate the impact of the pandemic where government lockdowns impose restrictions on personal freedom. We set out to consider how far this together with other factors may induce suicide. The literature does not as yet offer us a retrospective analysis of the influence of the global pandemic state on rates of suicide. Accordingly, we report a forensic case and examine the critical issues and problems in the management of these cases.","Aquila, Sacco, Ricci, Gratteri, Ricci","https://doi.org/10.1177/0025817220923691","20200515","Covid-19; Global pandemic; global alarm and anxiety; impact on suicide rates; lockdown; psychological autopsy; quarantine; restricted movement and ability to work; suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Changes in sleep pattern, sense of time and digital media use during COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Italy is one of the major COVID-19 hotspots. To reduce the spread of the infections and the pressure on Italian healthcare systems, since March 10, 2020, Italy has been under a total lockdown, forcing people into home confinement. Here we present data from 1,310 people living in the Italian territory (M<sub>age</sub> Â =Â 23.91Â Â±Â 3.60Â years, 880 females, 501 workers, 809 university students), who completed an online survey from March 24 to March 28, 2020. In the survey, we asked participants to think about their use of digital media before going to bed, their sleep pattern and their subjective experience of time in the previous week (March 17-23, which was the second week of the lockdown) and up to the first week of February (February 3-10, before any restriction in any Italian area). During the lockdown, people increased the usage of digital media near bedtime, but this change did not affect sleep habits. Nevertheless, during home confinement, sleep timing markedly changed, with people going to bed and waking up later, and spending more time in bed, but, paradoxically, also reporting a lower sleep quality. The increase in sleep difficulties was stronger for people with a higher level of depression, anxiety and stress symptomatology, and associated with the feeling of elongation of time. Considering that the lockdown is likely to continue for weeks, research data are urgently needed to support decision making, to build public awareness and to provide timely and supportive psychosocial interventions.","Cellini, Canale, Mioni, Costa","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13074","20200522","bedtime; circadian rhythms; depression; home confinement; social isolation; time perception","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This piece will highlight the links between depression and viral illnesses and explore important overlaps with Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, potentially implicating inflammatory mechanisms in those exposed to a range of viral agents.

"Development and initial validation of the COVID Stress Scales","Research and clinical observations suggest that during times of pandemic many people exhibit stress- or anxiety-related responses that include fear of becoming infected, fear of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces, fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection (i.e., disease-related xenophobia), fear of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking regarding possible pandemic-related threats, and traumatic stress symptoms about the pandemic (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts). We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related distress. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N = 3479) and the United States (N = 3375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking and reassurance seeking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, providing evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the distress associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services.","Taylor, Landry, Paluszek, Fergus, McKay, Asmundson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102232","20200602","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Fear; Pandemic; Stress; Xenophobia; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Canada; Coronavirus Infections; Fear; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Male; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Females, students, and others from Russia report higher levels of COVID-19-related fear than those from Belarus. Respondents from Russia and Belarus report less fear than people from Iran who were surveyed earlier. The scale used for the present survey evidenced a good Cronbach's Alpha measure of internal consistency or reliability (0.809). Clearly, further research is needed across locations and over time about the nature and extent of fear caused by COVID 19.

"Culture counts: the diverse effects of culture and society on mental health amidst COVID-19 outbreak in Australia","Since COVID-19 first emerged internationally, Australia has applied a number of public health measures to counter the disease' epidemiology. The public heath response has been effective in virus testing, diagnosing and treating patients with COVID-19. The imposed strict border restrictions and social distancing played a vital role in reducing positive cases via community transmission resulting in 'flattening of the curve'. Now is too soon to assess the impact of COVID-19 on people's mental health, as it will be determined by both short- and long-term consequences of exposure to stress, uncertainty, loss of control, loneliness and isolation. The authors explored cultural and societal influences on mental health during the current pandemic utilising Geert Hofstede's multidimensional construct of culture and determined psychological and cultural factors that foster resilience. We also reflected on the psychological impact of the pandemic on the individual and the group at large by utilising Michel Foucault' and Jacques Lacan' psychoanalytic theories. Remote Aboriginal Australian communities have been identified as a high-risk subpopulation in view of their unique vulnerabilities owing to their compromised health status, in addition to historical, systemic and cultural factors. Historically, Australia has prided itself in its multiculturalism; however, there has been evidence of an increase in racial microaggressions and xenophobia during this pandemic. Australia's model of cultural awareness will need to evolve, from reactionary to more reflective, post COVID-19 pandemic to best serve our multicultural, inclusive and integrated society.","Furlong, Finnie","https://doi.org/10.1017/ipm.2020.37","20200724","Australia; COVID-19; cultural competency; mental health; psychoanalysis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

While there are many forms of meditation and mindfulness, of particular interest to healthcare professionals are those with an evidence base such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR). Systematic reviews of such practices have shown improvements in measures of anxiety, depression and pain scores. Structural and functional brain changes have been demonstrated in the brains of people with a long-term traditional meditation practice, and in people who have completed a MBSR programme. Mindfulness and meditation practices translate well to different populations across the lifespan and range of ability.

This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident.

This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4<sup>th</sup> year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious.

"Innovation During COVID-19: Improving Addiction Treatment Access",": During the COVID-19 pandemic, many addiction treatment and harm reduction organizations have had to reduce their hours and services for people with substance use disorders, placing these individuals at increased risk of death. In order to address restricted treatment access during COVID-19, guidance from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, the US Drug Enforcement Administration, and the US Department of Health and Human Services has allowed for use of audio-only telehealth encounters for buprenorphine induction without requiring an in-person evaluation or video interface. This has enabled innovations in order to try to meet the needs of the most vulnerable among us during the current pandemic. In this new regulatory environment, we established the Rhode Island Buprenorphine Hotline, a phone hotline which functions as a &quot;tele-bridge&quot; clinic where people with moderate to severe opioid use disorder can be linked with a DATA 2000 waivered provider who can provide an initial assessment and, if appropriate, prescribe buprenorphine for unobserved induction and linkage to outpatient treatment.

"An online solution focused brief therapy for adolescent anxiety during the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic: a structured summary of a study protocol for a randomised controlled trial","This study aims to assess the effectiveness of delivering Solution Focused Brief Therapy (SFBT) through telecommunication with a group of adolescents who present anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. We hypothesize that participants who are randomly assigned to receive 2-4 sessions of Solution Focused Brief Therapy would have better clinical outcomes than participants who are in the waitlist group. We additionally hypothesized that using SFBT can also change participants' depression levels and their coping strategies in dealing with distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study employs a randomized delayed crossover open label controlled trial in adolescents who are presenting anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"Telehealth Home Support During COVID-19 Confinement for Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Mild Cognitive Impairment or Mild Dementia: Survey Study","The public health emergency of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is rapidly evolving worldwide; some countries, including Spain, have implemented restrictive measures. Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care and decrease exposure risk. The aims of this study were to explore the impact of confinement on the health and well-being of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, to provide television-based and telephone-based health and social support, and to study the effects of a television-based assistive integrated technology, TV-AssistDem (TeleVision-based ASSistive Integrated Service to supporT European adults living with mild DEMentia or mild cognitive impairment). A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020. Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. The mean age was 73.34 (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17/93 respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms. Grocery and pharmacy outings were performed by family members of 68/93 participants (73%); 57 (61%) reported overall well-being, and 65 (70%) maintained their sleep quality. However, participants living alone reported greater negative feelings and more sleeping problems. Regarding leisure activities, 53/93 respondents (57%) took walks, 32 (35%) played memory games, 55 (60%) watched television, and 91 (98%) telephoned relatives. 58/93 (64%) respondents reported accessing moderate or too much COVID-19 information, 89 (97%) received it from television, and 56 (62%) stated that their understanding of the information was extreme. 39/93 (39%) respondents had contacted health and social services, while 29 (31%) requested information regarding these services during the telephone call. There were no significant differences in health and well-being between the intervention and control groups. Respondents with TV-AssistDem performed more memory exercises (24/93, 52% vs 8/93, 17.4%; P&lt;.001) than control respondents. Our findings suggest that during COVID-19 confinement, the physical and mental health and well-being was optimal for the majority of our vulnerable population. However, those living alone reported greater negative psychological effects and sleeping problems. Measures adopted to address the negative experiences of confinement included keeping informed about the situation, accessing health and social services, having a support network that prevents risk of exposure to COVID-19 and guarantees food and medical supplies, a daily routine with maintained sleeping habits and leisure activities, staying physically and mentally active with cognitive stimulation exercises, and ensuring social connectedness using technology. Television sets were preferred technological devices to access COVID-19 information, watch television as a recreational activity, and perform memory exercises as an intellectual activity. Television-based telehealth support using TV-AssistDem demonstrated potential for cognitive stimulation.

Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is a trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder that is effective when delivered in-person or via telehealth. Given current limitations on the provision of in-person mental health treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic, this article presents guidelines and treatment considerations when implementing CPT via telehealth. Based on lessons learned from prior studies and clinical delivery of CPT via telehealth, recommendations are made with regard to overall strategies for adapting CPT to a telehealth format, including how to conduct routine assessments and ensure treatment fidelity.","Moring, Dondanville, Fina, Hassija, Chard, Monson, LoSavio, Wells, Morland, Kaysen, Galovski, Resick","https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22544","20200612",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Invasive strategy for COVID patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome: The first multicenter Italian experience","To report our initial experience of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)/acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients undergoing standard of care invasive management. The rapid diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 together with the need for isolation for infected patients might be responsible for a suboptimal treatment for SARS-CoV-2 ACS patients. Recently, the group of Sichuan published a protocol for COVID/ACS infected patients that see the thrombolysis as the gold standard of care. We enrolled 31 consecutive patients affected by SARS-COV-2 admitted to our emergencies room for suspected ACS. All patients underwent urgent coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) when required except two patients with severe hypoxemia and unstable hemodynamic condition that were conservatively treated. Twenty-one cases presented diffuse ST-segment depression while in the remaining cases anterior and inferior ST-elevation was present in four and six cases, respectively. PCI was performed in all cases expect two that were diagnosed as suspected myocarditis because of the absence of severe coronary disease and three with apical ballooning at ventriculography diagnostic for Tako-Tsubo syndromes. Two patients conservatively treated died. The remaining patients undergoing PCI survived except one that required endotracheal intubation (ETI) and died at Day 6. ETI was required in five more patients while in the remaining cases CPAP was used for respiratory support. Urgent PCI for ACS is often required in SARS-CoV-2 patients improving the prognosis in all but the most advanced patients. Complete patient history and examination, routine ECG monitoring, echocardiography, and careful evaluation of changes in cardiac enzymes should be part of the regular assessment procedures also in dedicated COVID positive units.","Secco, Tarantini, Mazzarotto, Garbo, Parisi, Maggio, Vercellino, Pistis, Audo, Kozel, Centini, Di Mario","https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.28959","20200606","COVID-19; PCI; SARS-CoV-2; acute coronary syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Despite the appropriate supportive intervention, on hospital day 7, he attempted suicide by jumping from the third-floor ward. The patient underwent urgent surgery and was transferred to a level I trauma center under strict isolation. Our findings emphasize the importance of the mental health aspects of patients treated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic requires social distancing, quarantine and isolation, which may precipitate new psychiatric symptoms in people without mental illness or aggravate existing conditions.Mental health service providers, including psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers, should be available in every facility taking care of COVID-19 patients.Health workers treating patients during the COVID-19 pandemic should be aware of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and/or distress developing in their patients and colleagues.","Epstein, Andrawis, Lipsky, Ziad, Matan","https://doi.org/10.12890/2020_001651","20200516","COVID-19; Suicidality; distress; isolation; quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"What about heart and mind in the covid-19 era?","From the time of Hippocratic medicine, heart-brain interactions have been recognized and contributed to both mental and physical health. Heart-brain interactions are complex and multifaceted and appear to be bidirectional. Exposure to chronic and daily stressors such as quarantine, or severe psychological trauma like a significant person in danger of life can affect the cardiovascular system and the emotional experience of the individual, leading to an increased risk of developing a cardiovascular disease or mental illness. Subjects with comorbidities between mental disorders and heart diseases are obviously more susceptible to be influenced by emotional burden due to the spread of COVID-19, with emotional responses characterized by fear, panic, anger, frustration. Psychological services and crisis interventions are needed at an early stage to reduce anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder in such a stressful period, with a special attention to special groups of patients, such as women, children, or the elderly.","Mazza, Marano, Antonazzo, Cavarretta, Di Nicola, Janiri, Sani, Frati, Romagnoli","https://doi.org/10.23736/S0026-4725.20.05309-8","20200513",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Telehealth for High-Risk Pregnancies in the Setting of the COVID-19 Pandemic","As New York City became an international epicenter of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, telehealth was rapidly integrated into prenatal care at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, an academic hospital system in Manhattan. Goals of implementation were to consolidate in-person prenatal screening, surveillance, and examinations into fewer in-person visits while maintaining patient access to ongoing antenatal care and subspecialty consultations via telehealth virtual visits. The rationale for this change was to minimize patient travel and thus risk for COVID-19 exposure. Because a large portion of obstetric patients had underlying medical or fetal conditions placing them at increased risk for adverse outcomes, prenatal care telehealth regimens were tailored for increased surveillance and/or counseling. Based on the incorporation of telehealth into prenatal care for high-risk patients, specific recommendations are made for the following conditions, clinical scenarios, and services: (1) hypertensive disorders of pregnancy including preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic hypertension; (2) pregestational and gestational diabetes mellitus; (3) maternal cardiovascular disease; (4) maternal neurologic conditions; (5) history of preterm birth and poor obstetrical history including prior stillbirth; (6) fetal conditions such as intrauterine growth restriction, congenital anomalies, and multiple gestations including monochorionic placentation; (7) genetic counseling; (8) mental health services; (9) obstetric anesthesia consultations; and (10) postpartum care. While telehealth virtual visits do not fully replace in-person encounters during prenatal care, they do offer a means of reducing potential patient and provider exposure to COVID-19 while providing consolidated in-person testing and services. KEY POINTS: Â· Telehealth for prenatal care is feasible.. Â· Telehealth may reduce coronavirus exposure during prenatal care.. Â· Telehealth should be tailored for high risk prenatal patients..","Aziz, Zork, Aubey, Baptiste, D'Alton, Emeruwa, Fuchs, Goffman, Gyamfi-Bannerman, Haythe, LaSala, Madden, Miller, Miller, Monk, Moroz, Ona, Ring, Sheen, Spiegel, Simpson, Yates, Friedman","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1712121","20200707","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Genetic Counseling; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Infection Control; New York City; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy, High-Risk; Prenatal Care; Prenatal Diagnosis; Remote Consultation; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Adaptation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Its Association with Psychological Distress and Life Satisfaction in Turkey","The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of an infectious disease called COVID-19 which has drawn global intensive attention. While global attention is largely focusing on the effects of the coronavirus on physical health, the impacts of the coronavirus on psychological health cannot be overlooked. Therefore, this study aims to adapt the Fear of COVID-19 Scale into Turkish and investigate the relationships between fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and life satisfaction. Data were collected by convenience sampling method, which allowed us to reach total 1304 participants, aged between 18 and 64Â years, from 75 cities in Turkey. In the adaptation process of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, convergent validity, and reliability (Cronbach's Î±, McDonald's Ï‰, Guttmann's Î»6, and composite reliability) analyses were performed. Additionally, the mediating role of psychological distress on the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and life satisfaction was tested. The uni-dimensionality of the 7-item scale was confirmed on a Turkish sample. Item Response Theory revealed that all items were coherent and fit with the model. The results indicated that the Turkish version of the scale had satisfactory reliability coefficients. The fear of COVID-19 was found to be associated with psychological distress and life satisfaction. Results indicated that the Turkish version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale had strong psychometric properties. This scale will allow mental health professionals to do research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19 in Turkey.","Satici, Gocet-Tekin, Deniz, Satici","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00294-0","20200515","COVID-19; Fear; Life satisfaction; Psychological distress; Scale","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A global treatments for coronaviruses including COVID-19","In late December 2019 in Wuhan, China, several patients with viral pneumonia were identified as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). So far, there are no specific treatments for patients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), and the treatments available today are based on previous experience with similar viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and Influenza virus. In this article, we have tried to reach a therapeutic window of drugs available to patients with COVID-19. Cathepsin L is required for entry of the 2019-nCoV virus into the cell as target teicoplanin inhibits virus replication. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2) in soluble form as a recombinant protein can prevent the spread of coronavirus by restricting binding and entry. In patients with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine decreases the inflammatory response and cytokine storm, but overdose causes toxicity and mortality. Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV. Ribavirin reduces hemoglobin concentrations in respiratory patients, and remdesivir improves respiratory symptoms. Use of ribavirin in combination with LPV/r in patients with SARS-CoV reduces acute respiratory distress syndrome and mortality, which has a significant protective effect with the addition of corticosteroids. Favipiravir increases clinical recovery and reduces respiratory problems and has a stronger antiviral effect than LPV/r. currently, appropriate treatment for patients with COVID-19 is an ACE2 inhibitor and a clinical problem reducing agent such as favipiravir in addition to hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids.","Yousefi, Valizadeh, Ghaffari, Vahedi, Karbalaei, Eslami","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.29785","20200714","COVID-19; antiviral; coronavirus; drug; treatment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Not all world leaders use Twitter in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: impact of the way of Angela Merkel on psychological distress, behaviour and risk perception","At a time of growing governmental restrictions and 'physical distancing' in order to decelerate the spread of COVID-19, psychological challenges are increasing. Social media plays an important role in maintaining social contact as well as exerting political influence. World leaders use it not only to keep citizens informed but also to boost morale and manage people's fears. However, some leaders do not follow this approach; an example is the German Chancellor. In a large online survey, we aimed to determine levels of COVID-19 fear, generalized anxiety, depression, safety behaviour, trust in government and risk perception in Germany. A total of 12Â 244 respondents participated during the period of restraint and the public shutdown in March 2020. Concurrent with the German Chancellor's speech, a reduction of anxiety and depression was noticeable in the German population. It appears that, in addition to using social media platforms like Twitter, different-and sometimes more conservative-channels for providing information can also be effective.","Teufel, Schweda, DÃ¶rrie, Musche, Hetkamp, WeismÃ¼ller, Lenzen, Stettner, Kohler, BÃ¤uerle, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa060","20200529",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Role of Non-Profit Organizations During COVID-19 for Diabetes Care: Health Care Inequities and Role of Virtual Specialty Clinic","Today, in the United States, we have a health care system that is designed to treat symptoms, not people-and to do so as cheaply as possible with the dual goals of minimizing costs and preventing hospital visits. We are failing on all fronts. We spend more money on health care per capita than our Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) peers, and our outcomes are mediocre at best. Medicine is not personal, health care professionals often have their hands tied by payers, and geography has too much influence on the quality of care available. This has to end, especially since we have the technology to create a truly patient-focused, whole-person approach-one that treats physical and mental health equally and meets people where they are in every sense. Telemedicine can level the playing field and enable higher quality, decentralized care that-when needed-brings specialty care to the masses. Other technologies have an important role, too. For patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (type 1 diabetes), widespread uptake of continuous glucose monitors may be the game-changer we need right now that can facilitate telemedicine to remote places and remove health care disparities.

"Analysis of Psychological and Sleep Status and Exercise Rehabilitation of Front-Line Clinical Staff in the Fight Against COVID-19 in China","BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to understand the changes in psychological factors and sleep status of front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19 and provide evidence of exercise interventions to relieve psychological stress and improve sleep status for medical staff. MATERIAL AND METHODS A survey study was conducted among 120 front-line medical staff in the fight against COVID-19, of which 60 medical staff worked at the designated hospital (experimental group) and 60 medical staff worked at the non-designated hospital (control group). The Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), and PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) were used to assess mental status. Sleep status was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). RESULTS SCL-90 scores of somatization, depression, anxiety, and terror were higher than normal in front-line medical staff at the designated hospital. The SAS (45.89Â±1.117), SDS (50.13Â±1.813), and PCL-C (50.13Â±1.813) scores in the experimental group were higher than the normal control group, and were significantly different from those in the control group on SDS and PCL-C scales (P&lt;0.05). The total average PSQI of the experimental group was 16.07Â±3.761, indicating that the sleep quality was poor. Among them, participants with moderate insomnia reached 61.67%, and participants with severe insomnia reached 26.67%. CONCLUSIONS There are psychological symptoms and sleep symptoms in front-line medical staff who participate in the fight against COVID-19, and they affect each other.

"The potential impact of COVID-19 on psychosis: A rapid review of contemporary epidemic and pandemic research","The COVID-19 outbreak may profoundly impact population mental health because of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress. An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted. Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis. Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria. Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%. Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress. Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging. Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted. How to support adherence to physical distancing requirements and engagement with services in patients with existing psychosis requires careful consideration.

"Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical perspectives from a case series","The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del RocÃ­o and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.","ValdÃ©s-Florido, LÃ³pez-DÃ­az, Palermo-Zeballos, MartÃ­nez-Molina, MartÃ­n-Gil, Crespo-Facorro, Ruiz-Veguilla","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009","20200624","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Psychotic disorders; SARS-CoV-2; Suicide; Suicidio; Trastornos psicÃ³ticos; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Psychological Distress; Psychotic Disorders; Quarantine; Risk Factors; Spain; Stress, Psychological; Suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"How an Epidemic Outbreak Impacts Happiness: Factors that Worsen (vs Protect) Emotional Well-being during the Coronavirus Pandemic","What are the factors that worsen (vs. protect) emotional well-being during a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19? Through two large-scale nationwide surveys (N<sub>1</sub>Â =Â 11,131; N<sub>2</sub>Â =Â 3,000) conducted in China immediately before versus during the coronavirus outbreak, we found that the onset of the coronavirus epidemic led to a 74% drop in overall emotional well-being. Factors associated with the likelihood of contracting the disease (e.g., residing near the epicenter), extent of potential harm (e.g., being an elderly), and relational issues (e.g., those within a marriage) exacerbated the detrimental effect of the outbreak on emotional well-being. Further, individuals' perception of their knowledge about coronavirus infection was another factor. Regardless of the actual amount of knowledge they possessed, those perceiving themselves as more knowledgeable, were able to experience more happiness during the outbreak. Higher perceived knowledge was associated with a stronger sense of control, which mediated the differences in emotional well-being. These patterns persisted even after controlling for a host of demographic and economic variables. In conclusion, public policies and mental health interventions aimed at boosting/protecting psychological well-being during epidemics should take account of these factors.","Yang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113045","20200707","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Emotional well-being; Epidemic; Happiness; Infectious disease; Pandemic; Psychological well-being; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review","COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.","Mohamed, Alawna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038","20200717","Aerobic capacity; COVID-19; Immune system; Respiratory system","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Danger in danger: Interpersonal violence during COVID-19 quarantine","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is defined as physical or sexual violence, emotional abuse and stalking. It is typically experienced by women but can also be experienced by men. During quarantine due to the COVID-19, home risks to become a very dangerous place for victims of domestic violence. Very recent studies focusing on abusive situations during COVID emergence were identified in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase. During the COVID-19 outbreak people have encountered an invisible and dark enemy and an experience of impotence. Due to the feelings of frustration and agitation, aggression arises with possible transgenerational transmission of trauma and violence. Especially during quarantine and COVID emergence around the world there is a need of programs aimed to prevent acts of domestic violence and to achieve accurate assessment of multiple domains of abuse (psychological, physical, sexual) provided by trained multidisciplinary staffs (including psychiatrists, psychologists, social and legal services).","Mazza, Marano, Lai, Janiri, Sani","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113046","20200710","Aggression; COVID-19; Intimate Partner Violence; Mental Health; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"How Has COVID-19 Affected Our Orthopedic Implant Industry Partners? Implications for the Surgeon-Industry Relationship in 2020 and Beyond","The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching societal and financial consequences. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how COVID-19 has affected AAHKS industry partners and the surgeon-industry relationship, emphasizing education, resource allocation, and strategic direction for the second half ofÂ 2020. AAHKS industry partners were contacted to participate in a blinded survey and optional interview with the AAHKS Industry Relations Committee. Based on the results, a group of AAHKS member surgeons with disparate practice types were asked to postulate on how the COVID-19 pandemic has and will affect their practice and relationship with Industry. AAHKS industry partner responses indicated decreased resource allocation for regional, &quot;other national,&quot; and AAHKS annual meetings (67%, 55%, and 30%, respectively). Web-based educational content was expected to increase in 2020 and will likely remain a point of emphasis in 2021 (100% and 70% of responders). For Q3/Q4 2020, a significant emphasis was placed on site of service/outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures (70% and 90% of responders), as well as increased availability of instrumentation and implants (40% and 60%, respectively). The COVID-19 pandemic has altered the orthopedic landscape for the foreseeable future. Survey responses by AAHKS industry partners demonstrate a continued commitment to surgeon education with an increasing shift to a web-based platform. Increased resource allocation for outpatient TJA and COVID-19-related safety measures were significant. Articulating optimal mechanisms to aid industry in supporting surgeons with different practice models to meet demand during the second half of fiscal year 2020 will be critical.","Warth, Noiseux, Duncan, Daines, Mahoney","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arth.2020.04.063","20200702","COVID-19; academic practice; hospital employed; industry partner; private practice; surgeon education; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Industry; Orthopedics; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Surgeons; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

As the crisis evolves and persists, it will be increasingly important for the research community to conduct investigations that address the mental health consequences of COVID-19. The causes of mental health effects in the context of COVID-19 are multifactorial and likely include biological, behavioral, and environmental determinants. We argue that the COVID-19 crisis significantly threatens our basic human need for human connection, which might serve as a crucial environmental factor that could underlie the overall insult to our mental health. Furthermore, &quot;brain styles,&quot; which we have previously conceptualized as &quot;biotypes&quot; that are informed by a neural taxonomy, might interact with the universal threat to our need for human connection to explain the mental health consequences of COVID-19 from a precision psychiatry perspective.

"Levels and predictors of anxiety, depression and health anxiety during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkish society: The importance of gender","The COVID-19 pandemic is having negative effects on societies' mental health. Both the pandemic and the measures taken to combat it can affect individuals' mental health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the levels of depression, anxiety and health anxiety in Turkish society during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine the factors affecting these. The study was performed using an online questionnaire. Participants were asked to complete a sociodemographic data form, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI). The effects on depression, anxiety and health anxiety levels of factors such as age, sex, marital status, living with an individual aged above 60, the presence of a new Coronavirus+ patient among friends or relatives, previous and current psychiatric illness and presence of accompanying chronic disease were then investigated. In terms of HADS cut-off points, 23.6% (<i>n</i> = 81) of the population scored above the depression cut-off point, and 45.1% (<i>n</i> = 155) scored above the cut-off point for anxiety. In regression analysis, female gender, living in urban areas and previous psychiatric illness history were found as risk factors for anxiety; living in urban areas was found as risk factor for depression; and female gender, accompanying chronic disease and previous psychiatric history were found as risk factors for health anxiety. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that the groups most psychologically affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are women, individuals with previous psychiatric illness, individuals living in urban areas and those with an accompanying chronic disease. Priority might therefore be attached to these in future psychiatric planning.","Ã–zdin, Bayrak Ã–zdin","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020927051","20200508","COVID-19; Health anxiety; anxiety; depression","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

One option may be to deliver healthcare interventions remotely through digital healthcare solutions. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to bring together the evidence for remote healthcare during a quarantine situation period to support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation. The PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were searched using telehealth OR digital health OR mHealth OR eHealth OR mobile apps AND COVID-19 OR quarantine search terms. We also searched for literature relating to cardiovascular disease AND quarantine. The literature search identified 45 potentially relevant publications, out of which nine articles were included. Three overarching themes emerged from this review: (1) preparing the workforce and ensuring reimbursement for remote healthcare, (2) supporting mental and physical health and (3) supporting usual care. To support people living with cardiovascular disease during COVID-19 isolation and to mitigate the effects of quarantine and adverse effect on mental and physical well-being, we should offer remote healthcare and provide access to their usual care.","Neubeck, Hansen, Jaarsma, Klompstra, Gallagher","https://doi.org/10.1177/1474515120924530","20200508","COVID-19; Cardiovascular disease; digital health; isolation; quarantine; remote healthcare; telehealth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups.

The UK Government's advice for vulnerable people, including older adults, to move towards self-isolation and social distancing is likely to reduce rates of transmission, the risk of severe illness and the impact on the acute health services. Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people. It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear.

"Closure of Universities Due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): Impact on Education and Mental Health of Students and Academic Staff","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), originated in Wuhan city of China, has spread rapidly around the world, sending billions of people into lockdown. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus epidemic a pandemic. In light of rising concern about the current COVID-19 pandemic, a growing number of universities across the world have either postponed or canceled all campus events such as workshops, conferences, sports, and other activities. Universities are taking intensive measures to prevent and protect all students and staff members from the highly infectious disease. Faculty members are already in the process of transitioning to online teaching platforms. In this review, the author will highlight the potential impact of the terrible COVID-19 outbreak on the education and mental health of students and academic staff.","Sahu","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7541","20200509","coronavirus; covid-19; education; mental health; outbreak; pandemic; universities","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How Essential Is to Focus on Physician's Health and Burnout in Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic?","An infection of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) that originated from Wuhan city of China in December 2019 converted rapidly into pandemic by March 11, 2020. To date, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has risen exponentially in more than 200 countries, with an estimated crude mortality ratio of at least over 2%. The unpreparedness to tackle the unprecedented situation of coronavirus has contributed to the rising number of cases, which has generated an immense sense of fear and anxiety amongst the public. It has further resulted in the inadequacy and unavailability of essential medical supplies, physicians, and healthcare workers (HCW). Although the chief focus is on minimizing transmission through prevention, combating infection, and saving lives by ramping up the development of treatment and vaccines, very little attention is on the critical issue of physician burnout, resident burnout, and the psychological well-being of HCW. Until now, no significant steps have been taken by the authorities to minimize the COVID-19 specific contributing factors for burnout. The COVID-19 has posed strain on the entire healthcare system already, and it is vital to remediate the issue of physician and resident burnout urgently with concrete actions to avoid subsequent potential short-term and long-term adverse implications.","Shah, Chaudhari, Kamrai, Lail, Patel","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7538","20200509","burnout; coronavirus; covid-19; ecfmg; gme; mental health; pandemic; physician burnout; psychiatry; resident burnout","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Psychological status and sleep quality of nursing interns during the outbreak of COVID-19]","To investigate the psychological status and sleep quality of nursing interns in collective isolation during the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and provide evidence for adequate interventions. We surveyed a total of 95 nursing interns who were isolated collectively in a general teaching hospital in Guangzhou using a self-designed questionnaire, which consisted of a basic information form, self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive analysis, single factor analysis and correlation analysis were used to analyze the current status of the interns' psychology and sleep quality, the potential factors affecting their psychology and sleep quality, and the correlation between their psychological status and sleep quality. The surveyed interns had SAS, SDS and PSQI score of 37.79Â±6.59, 43.98Â±9.74 and 5.20Â±3.14, respectively, which were significant higher than the national norms in China (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that both anxiety and depression were positively correlated with the sleep quality score (<i>r</i>=0.508 and 0.546, respectively). Univariate analysis showed that the major factors affecting the psychological status and sleep quality of the interns during collective isolation included recent contact with persons from the affected area before isolation and the onset of fever during the isolation. These interns showed relatively high levels of anxiety and depression during the collective isolation to affect their sleep quality, and interventions should be timely administered to improve their mental health and sleep quality.","Sheng, Liu, Zhou, Liao","https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.03.09","20200511","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; nursing interns; sleep disturbance; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Mental health status and its influencing factors among college students during the epidemic of COVID-19]","To investigate the mental health status of college students during the epidemic of COVID-19 and identify the factors influencing the mental health of the students. Using a general questionnaire, a self-designed new coronavirus pneumonia knowledge and cognitive behavior questionnaire, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9), we conducted an internet-based questionnaire survey of 3881 college students in Guangdong Province. A multinomial-logistic regression model was used to analyze the collected data. The survey showed that 69.47% of the college students had a high level of awareness of COVID-19; the overall incidence of anxiety was 26.60%, and the incidences of mild, moderate and severe anxiety were 23.19%, 2.71%, and 0.70%, respectively. Depressive emotions were detected in 21.16% of the students, and the incidences of mild, moderate, and moderate-to-severe depression were 16.98%, 3.17%, and 1.01%, respectively. The results of multivariate analysis showed that an older age was associated with a higher level of awareness of COVID-19 and greater changes in future health behaviors were associated with less anxiety and depression among the students. The students currently in rural areas, of non-medical majors, and reporting half of their information concerning the epidemic being negative were more likely to have anxiety; female gender, residence in suburbs, a drinking history, and excessive negative information concerning the epidemic were all associated with the likeliness of depression. The college students have different levels of anxiety and depression during the epidemic. Depression and anxiety are closely related, but the factors contributing to different levels of such emotions can be different, and colleges and related departments are urged to provide precision mental health education for college students.","Chang, Yuan, Wang","https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2020.02.06","20200508","COVID-19; college students; health education; mental health; Adolescent; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Healing; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Challenges in maintaining treatment services for people who use drugs during the COVID-19 pandemic","The impact of COVID-19 across health services, including treatment services for people who use drugs, is emerging but likely to have a high impact. Treatment services for people who use drugs provide essential treatment services including opiate agonist treatment and needle syringe programmes alongside other important treatment programmes across all substance types including withdrawal and counselling services. Drug and alcohol hospital consultation-liaison clinicians support emergency departments and other services provided in hospital settings in efficiently managing patients who use drugs and present with other health problems.COVID-19 will impact on staff availability for work due to illness. Patients may require home isolation and quarantine periods. Ensuring ongoing supply of opiate treatment during these periods will require significant changes to how treatment is provided. The use of monthly depot buprenorphine as well as moving from a framework of supervised dosing will be required for patients on sublingual buprenorphine and methadone. Ensuring ready access to take-home naloxone for patients is crucial to reduce overdose risks. Delivery of methadone and buprenorphine to the homes of people with confirmed COVID-19 infections is likely to need to occur to support home isolation.People who use drugs are likely to be more vulnerable during the COVID-19 epidemic, due to poorer health literacy and stigma and discrimination towards this group. People who use drugs may prioritise drug use above other health concerns. Adequate supply of clean injecting equipment is important to prevent outbreaks of blood-borne viruses. Opiate users may misinterpret SARS-CoV2 symptoms as opiate withdrawal and manage this by using opioids. Ensuring people who use drugs have access to drug treatment as well as access to screening and testing for SARS-CoV2 where this is indicated is important.","Dunlop, Lokuge, Masters, Sequeira, Saul, Dunlop, Ryan, Hall, Ezard, Haber, Lintzeris, Maher","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-020-00370-7","20200511","Continuity of Patient Care; Coronavirus Infections; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Substance-Related Disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

A significant proportion of the population live alone or are vulnerable to mental health problems yet, in the vast majority of cases, individuals in social isolation have no access to mental healthcare. The only resource is people themselves using self-help, self-medication and self-care. During prolonged COVID-19 isolation, an in-built system of homeostasis can help rebalance activity, thought and feeling. Increased physical activity enables a reset of physical and mental well-being. During periods of lockdown, it is recommended that exercise should be as vigorously promoted as social distancing itself.","Matias, Dominski, Marks","https://doi.org/10.1177/1359105320925149","20200611","COVID-19 pandemic; communicable diseases; exercise; mental health; needs; psychological homeostasis; self-esteem; Betacoronavirus; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus Infections; Exercise; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Self Care; Social Isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Stress, anxiety, and depression levels in the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in a population sample in the northern Spain","The SARS-CoV-2 virus reached Spain in March 2020, and a nationwide state of alert was declared on March 14th, leading to the confinement of the entire population. The current study was conducted in the Basque Autonomous Community in northern Spain. The authors analyzed stress, anxiety, and depression with the arrival of the virus and the levels of symptoms according to age, comorbidity, and confinement. Levels of anxiety, stress, and depression were measured in a sample of 976 adults, using the DASS scale (Depression Anxiety, and Stress Scale). Although levels of symptoms were generally low at the start of the alert, younger individuals with chronic diseases reported more symptoms than the rest of the population. The study also detected higher levels of symptoms after the stay-at-home order was issued. Such symptoms are predicted to increase as the confinement continues. The authors propose psychological interventions for prevention and treatment in order to mitigate the pandemic's psychological impacts. En marzo de 2020, el virus SARS-CoV-2 procedente de China ha llegado a EspaÃ±a y desde el 14 de marzo se ha declarado el estado de alarma en todo el Estado espaÃ±ol, llevando al confinamiento a toda la poblaciÃ³n. La presente investigaciÃ³n se contextualiza en la Comunidad AutÃ³noma Vasca (situada al norte de EspaÃ±a).

"Validation and Psychometric Evaluation of the Italian Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale","The advent of COVID-19 worldwide has led to consequences for people's health, both physical and psychological, such as fear and anxiety. This is the case in Italy, one of the countries most affected by the pandemic. Given the heightened fear concerning COVID-19 in Italy., the present study analyzed the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S). The sample comprised 250 Italian participants who were administered Italian versions of the FCV-19S, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the Severity Measure for Specific Phobia-Adult (SMSP-A). Several psychometric tests were performed to investigate the validity and reliability of the test including confirmatory factor analysis. Analysis of the data showed satisfactory psychometric characteristics and confirmed the scale's unidimensional properties. The seven FCV-19S items had acceptable correlations with the test total (from .443 to .784). Furthermore, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from .684 to .897). The internal consistency was very good (Î± = .871). Construct validity for the FCV-19S was supported by significant and positive correlations with the HADS (r=.649) and SMSP-A (r=.703). The Italian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale is valid and reliable in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general Italian population.","Soraci, Ferrari, Abbiati, Del Fante, De Pace, Urso, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00277-1","20200508","COVID-19; Disease fear; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Italian; Psychometrics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Sleep disturbances among medical workers during the outbreak of COVID-2019","The outbreak of Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has posed unprecedented pressure and threats to healthcare workers in Wuhan and the entire country. To assess the effect of the COVID-19 outbreak on the sleep quality of healthcare workers in a children's healthcare centre in Wuhan. A cross-sectional, anonymized, self-reported questionnaire survey was conducted at the Children's Healthcare Centre of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China. The questionnaire consisted of three parts, including socio-demographic characteristics and COVID-19 epidemic-related factors, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI), and Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS). In total, 47 out of 123 (38%) participants with PSQI scores &gt; 7 were identified as having sleep disturbance. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child (adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.40 (1.21-9.57), P &lt; 0.05), exposure to COVID-19 patients (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.97 (1.08-8.18), P &lt; 0.05) and depression (adjusted OR and 95% CI 2.83 (1.10-7.27), P &lt; 0.05). We observed that, during the outbreak of COVID-19, sleep disturbance was highly prevalent among paediatric healthcare workers, and sleep disturbance was independently associated with being an only child, exposure to COVID-19 patients and depression. Therefore, more mental health services are required for front-line paediatric healthcare workers in Wuhan.","Wang, Xie, Xu, Yu, Yao, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqaa074","20200720"," COVID-19; paediatric healthcare workers; sleep disturbance","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) Consortium: A Call to Action","The rapid pace of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19) pandemic presents challenges to the real-time collection of population-scale data to inform near-term public health needs as well as future investigations. We established the COronavirus Pandemic Epidemiology (COPE) consortium to address this unprecedented crisis on behalf of the epidemiology research community. As a central component of this initiative, we have developed a COVID Symptom Study (previously known as the COVID Symptom Tracker) mobile application as a common data collection tool for epidemiologic cohort studies with active study participants. This mobile application collects information on risk factors, daily symptoms, and outcomes through a user-friendly interface that minimizes participant burden. Combined with our efforts within the general population, data collected from nearly 3 million participants in the United States and United Kingdom are being used to address critical needs in the emergency response, including identifying potential hot spots of disease and clinically actionable risk factors. The linkage of symptom data collected in the app with information and biospecimens already collected in epidemiology cohorts will position us to address key questions related to diet, lifestyle, environmental, and socioeconomic factors on susceptibility to COVID-19, clinical outcomes related to infection, and long-term physical, mental health, and financial sequalae. We call upon additional epidemiology cohorts to join this collective effort to strengthen our impact on the current health crisis and generate a new model for a collaborative and nimble research infrastructure that will lead to more rapid translation of our work for the betterment of public health.","Chan, Drew, Nguyen, Joshi, Ma, Guo, Lo, Mehta, Kwon, Sikavi, Magicheva-Gupta, Fatehi, Flynn, Leonardo, Albert, Andreotti, Beane-Freeman, Balasubramanian, Brownstein, Bruinsma, Cowan, Deka, Ernst, Figueiredo, Franks, Gardner, Ghobrial, Haiman, Hall, Deming-Halverson, Kirpach, Lacey, Marchand, Marinac, Martinez, Milne, Murray, Nash, Palmer, Patel, Rosenberg, Sandler, Sharma, Schurman, Wilkens, Chavarro, Eliassen, Hart, Kang, Koenen, Kubzansky, Mucci, Ourselin, Rich-Edwards, Song, Stampfer, Steves, Willett, Wolf, Spector","https://doi.org/10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-20-0606","20200720","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Data Collection; Humans; Models, Biological; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Smartphone; Software; United Kingdom; United States","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?]","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.","El-Hage, Hingray, Lemogne, Yrondi, Brunault, Bienvenu, Etain, Paquet, Gohier, Bennabi, Birmes, Sauvaget, Fakra, Prieto, Bulteau, Vidailhet, Camus, Leboyer, Krebs, Aouizerate","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","20200713","Anxiety; AnxiÃ©tÃ©; COVID-19; Depression; DÃ©pression; Health personnel; Mental health; Post-traumatic stress disorder; Professionnels de santÃ©; SantÃ© mentale; Trouble de stress post-traumatique; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Attitude of Health Personnel; Behavior, Addictive; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Depression; France; Health Personnel; Health Workforce; Helplessness, Learned; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Influenza Pandemic, 1918-1919; Occupational Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Devices; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Factors; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Social Support; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Suicide; Uncertainty; Work Schedule Tolerance; Workload","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Psychopathological consequences of confinement]","The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.","Mengin, AllÃ©, Rolling, Ligier, Schroder, Lalanne, Berna, Jardri, Vaiva, Geoffroy, Brunault, Thibaut, Chevance, Giersch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","20200713","Anxiety; AnxiÃ©tÃ©; Confinement; Depression; DÃ©pression; Hallucinations; PTSD; TSPT; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Behavior, Addictive; Betacoronavirus; Boredom; Child; Child Abuse; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Depression; Domestic Violence; Feeding and Eating Disorders; France; Hallucinations; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Patient Isolation; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep Wake Disorders; Social Isolation; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Suicide; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review","The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of &quot;COVID+ units&quot;. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. French mental healthcare is now facing a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the confinement of the general population.","Chevance, Gourion, Hoertel, Llorca, Thomas, Bocher, Moro, LaprÃ©vote, Benyamina, Fossati, Masson, Leaune, Leboyer, Gaillard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.005","20200624","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Epidemic; France; Pandemic; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Epidemics; France; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychotic Disorders; Quarantine; Risk Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A Nationwide Survey of Psychological Distress among Italian People during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors","The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has called for unprecedented measures, to the extent that the Italian government has imposed a quarantine on the entire country. Quarantine has a huge impact and can cause considerable psychological strain. The present study aims to establish the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress in the general population. An online survey was administered from 18-22 March 2020 to 2766 participants. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables; personality traits; depression, anxiety, and stress. Female gender, negative affect, and detachment were associated with higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Having an acquaintance infected was associated with increased levels of both depression and stress, whereas a history of stressful situations and medical problems was associated with higher levels of depression and anxiety. Finally, those with a family member infected and young person who had to work outside their domicile presented higher levels of anxiety and stress, respectively. This epidemiological picture is an important benchmark for identifying persons at greater risk of suffering from psychological distress and the results are useful for tailoring psychological interventions targeting the post-traumatic nature of the distress.","Mazza, Ricci, Biondi, Colasanti, Ferracuti, Napoli, Roma","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17093165","20200511","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health intervention; pandemic; quarantine; stress; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Quarantine; Risk Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 Hangover: A Rising Tide of Alcohol Use Disorder and Alcohol-Associated Liver Disease","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous global impact since it began in November of 2019. However, there are concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic will not affect all equally and some populations will be particularly vulnerable. Relevant to liver disease, patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) may be amongst the populations that are the most severely impacted. The reasons for this include being at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to a depressed immune system and high-risk underlying comorbidities, the injurious effect of COVID-19 on the liver, the inability to attend regular visits with providers, diversion of hospital resources, and social isolation leading to psychological decompensation and increased drinking or relapse. As a result, we fear that there will be a dramatic rising tide of alcohol relapse, admissions for decompensated ALD, and an increase in newly diagnosed patients with AUD/ALD post-COVID-19 pandemic. Providers and their institutions should implement pre-emptive strategies such as telehealth and aggressive patient outreach programs now to curb this anticipated problem. Liver transplantation (LT) centers should adapt to the pandemic by considering leniency to some LT candidates with ALD who cannot access appropriate alcohol treatment due to the current situation. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely be especially detrimental to patients with AUD/ALD and actions need to be taken now to limit the scope of this anticipated problem.","Da, Im, Schiano","https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.31307","20200509","COVID-19; alcohol use disorder; alcohol-associated liver disease; liver transplantation; relapse","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Epidemiology of and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infection in Health Care Workers: A Living Rapid Review","Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. To examine the burden of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV on HCWs and risk factors for infection, using rapid and living review methods. Multiple electronic databases, including the WHO database of publications on coronavirus disease and the medRxiv preprint server (2003 through 27 March 2020, with ongoing surveillance through 24 April 2020), and reference lists. Studies published in any language reporting incidence of or outcomes associated with coronavirus infections in HCWs and studies on the association between risk factors (demographic characteristics, role, exposures, environmental and administrative factors, and personal protective equipment [PPE] use) and HCW infections. New evidence will be incorporated on an ongoing basis by using living review methods. One reviewer abstracted data and assessed methodological limitations; verification was done by a second reviewer. 64 studies met inclusion criteria; 43 studies addressed burden of HCW infections (15 on SARS-CoV-2), and 34 studies addressed risk factors (3 on SARS-CoV-2). Health care workers accounted for a significant proportion of coronavirus infections and may experience particularly high infection incidence after unprotected exposures. Illness severity was lower than in non-HCWs. Depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were common in HCWs during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The strongest evidence on risk factors was on PPE use and decreased infection risk. The association was most consistent for masks but was also observed for gloves, gowns, eye protection, and handwashing; evidence suggested a dose-response relationship. No study evaluated PPE reuse. Certain exposures (such as involvement in intubations, direct patient contact, or contact with bodily secretions) were associated with increased infection risk. Infection control training was associated with decreased risk. There were few studies on risk factors for SARS-CoV-2, the studies had methodological limitations, and streamlined rapid review methods were used. Health care workers experience significant burdens from coronavirus infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Use of PPE and infection control training are associated with decreased infection risk, and certain exposures are associated with increased risk.

"Considerations for Postacute Rehabilitation for Survivors of COVID-19","Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported on December 31, 2019. Because it has only been studied for just over three months, our understanding of this disease is still incomplete, particularly regarding its sequelae and long-term outcomes. Moreover, very little has been written about the rehabilitation needs of patients with COVID-19 after discharge from acute care. The objective of this report is to answer the question &quot;What rehabilitation services do survivors of COVID-19 require?&quot; The question was asked within the context of a subacute hospital delivering geriatric inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation services. Three areas relevant to rehabilitation after COVID-19 were identified. First, details of how patients may present have been summarized, including comorbidities, complications from an intensive care unit stay with or without intubation, and the effects of the virus on multiple body systems, including those pertaining to cardiac, neurological, cognitive, and mental health. Second, I have suggested procedures regarding the design of inpatient rehabilitation units for COVID-19 survivors, staffing issues, and considerations for outpatient rehabilitation. Third, guidelines for rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech-language pathology) following COVID-19 have been proposed with respect to recovery of the respiratory system as well as recovery of mobility and function. A thorough assessment and an individualized, progressive treatment plan which focuses on function, disability, and return to participation in society will help each patient to maximize their function and quality of life. Careful consideration of the rehabilitation environment will ensure that all patients recover as completely as possible.","Sheehy","https://doi.org/10.2196/19462","20200521","covid-19; geriatric; infectious disease; inpatient rehabilitation; patient outcome; public health; recovery; rehabilitation; subacute care; treatment; virus; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Critical Care; Humans; Inpatients; Intensive Care Units; Pandemics; Patient Discharge; Physical Therapy Modalities; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Quality of Life; Speech-Language Pathology; Survivors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The Impact of Social Media on Panic During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Iraqi Kurdistan: Online Questionnaire Study","In the first few months of 2020, information and news reports about the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) were rapidly published and shared on social media and social networking sites. While the field of infodemiology has studied information patterns on the Web and in social media for at least 18 years, the COVID-19 pandemic has been referred to as the first social media infodemic. However, there is limited evidence about whether and how the social media infodemic has spread panic and affected the mental health of social media users. The aim of this study is to determine how social media affects self-reported mental health and the spread of panic about COVID-19 in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. To carry out this study, an online questionnaire was prepared and conducted in Iraqi Kurdistan, and a total of 516 social media users were sampled. This study deployed a content analysis method for data analysis. Correspondingly, data were analyzed using SPSS software. Participants reported that social media has a significant impact on spreading fear and panic related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan, with a potential negative influence on people's mental health and psychological well-being. Facebook was the most used social media network for spreading panic about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraq. We found a significant positive statistical correlation between self-reported social media use and the spread of panic related to COVID-19 (R=.8701). Our results showed that the majority of youths aged 18-35 years are facing psychological anxiety. During lockdown, people are using social media platforms to gain information about COVID-19. The nature of the impact of social media panic among people varies depending on an individual's gender, age, and level of education. Social media has played a key role in spreading anxiety about the COVID-19 outbreak in Iraqi Kurdistan.","Ahmad, Murad","https://doi.org/10.2196/19556","20200528","COVID-19; Iraq; Kurdistan region; fake news; impact; infodemic; mental health; misinformation; panic; social media; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Internet; Iraq; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Media; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Coronavirus binding to ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), a crucial component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, underlies much of this concern. Children are uniquely impacted by the coronavirus, but the reasons are unclear. This review will highlight the relationship of COVID-19 with hypertension, use of ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers, and lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease from the pediatric perspective. We briefly summarize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and comprehensively review the literature pertaining to the ACE 2/Ang-(1-7) pathway in children and the clinical evidence for how ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers affect this important pathway. Given the importance of the ACE 2/Ang-(1-7) pathway and the potential differences between adults and children, it is crucial that children are included in coronavirus-related research, as this may shed light on potential mechanisms for why children are at decreased risk of severe COVID-19.","South, Brady, Flynn","https://doi.org/10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.120.15291","20200622","Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Betacoronavirus; Child; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Hypertension; Pandemics; Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A; Pneumonia, Viral; Renin-Angiotensin System","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health, Risk Factors, and Social Media Use During the COVID-19 Epidemic and Cordon Sanitaire Among the Community and Health Professionals in Wuhan, China: Cross-Sectional Survey","The mental health consequences of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, community-wide interventions, and social media use during a pandemic are unclear. The first and most draconian interventions have been implemented in Wuhan, China, and these countermeasures have been increasingly deployed by countries around the world. The aim of this study was to examine risk factors, including the use of social media, for probable anxiety and depression in the community and among health professionals in the epicenter, Wuhan, China. We conducted an online survey via WeChat, the most widely used social media platform in China, which was administered to 1577 community-based adults and 214 health professionals in Wuhan. Probable anxiety and probable depression were assessed by the validated Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 (cutoff â‰¥3) and Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (cutoff â‰¥3), respectively. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine factors associated with probable anxiety and probable depression. Of the 1577 community-based adults, about one-fifth of respondents reported probable anxiety (n=376, 23.84%, 95% CI 21.8-26.0) and probable depression (n=303, 19.21%, 95% CI 17.3-21.2). Similarly, of the 214 health professionals, about one-fifth of surveyed health professionals reported probable anxiety (n=47, 22.0%, 95% CI 16.6-28.1) or probable depression (n=41, 19.2%, 95% CI 14.1-25.1). Around one-third of community-based adults and health professionals spent â‰¥2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media. Close contact with individuals with COVID-19 and spending â‰¥2 hours daily on COVID-19 news via social media were associated with probable anxiety and depression in community-based adults. Social support was associated with less probable anxiety and depression in both health professionals and community-based adults. The internet could be harnessed for telemedicine and restoring daily routines, yet caution is warranted toward spending excessive time searching for COVID-19 news on social media given the infodemic and emotional contagion through online social networks. Online platforms may be used to monitor the toll of the pandemic on mental health.","Ni, Yang, Leung, Li, Yao, Wang, Leung, Cowling, Liao","https://doi.org/10.2196/19009","20200519","COVID-19; WeChat; anxiety; community; depression; health professionals; intervention; mental health; nonpharmaceutical interventions; outbreak; pandemic; population mental health; public health; social media","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Assessing the Real-Time Mental Health Challenges of COVID-19 in Individuals With Serious Mental Illnesses: Protocol for a Quantitative Study","The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused significant stress and mental health problems among the general public. However, persons at greatest risk for poor mental health outcomes, such as people with serious mental illness, have been largely overlooked. This paper presents the protocol for a study that aims to examine the mental health impact of COVID-19 and social distancing behaviors in people with serious mental illness and the behaviors undertaken to prevent COVID-19 infection in this group. Participants will include individuals with serious mental illness (eg, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) and nonpsychiatric control participants who are currently participating in or have previously participated in several ongoing parent observational studies. Data will be collected from April 2020 through August 2020. Participants will complete phone interviews at 2 time points to assess their current emotional functioning and discuss the measures they have taken to prevent COVID-19 infection. Baseline (pre-COVID-19) mental health, sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period, will be compared with current mental health, also sampled by ecological momentary assessment over an extended period. Demographic, cognitive, and psychosocial factors at baseline will be used to examine risk and resilience to current mental health and coping. The inclusion of participants for the first round of telephone assessments started on April 3, 2020 and will be completed by May 31, 2020. As of April 30, 2020, 101 individuals had completed these first-round assessments. The second round of telephone assessments will likely occur between June 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020. Study results will be published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. Our findings will have broad implications for understanding the psychological consequences of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons with serious mental illness and will provide the opportunity to identify targets to reduce negative outcomes in the future. We also hope our efforts will provide a roadmap and resources for other researchers who would like to implement a similar approach.

The epidemiology of emotional disorders is greatly influenced by stressful events. This study sought to assess the prevalence rate and socio-demographic correlates of depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese adolescents affected by the outbreak of COVID-19. We conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese students aged 12-18Â years during the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to conduct rapid assessment. A total of 8079 participants were involved in the study. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, assess students' awareness of COVID-19, and assess depressive and anxiety symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, respectively. The prevalence of depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and a combination of depressive and anxiety symptoms was 43.7%, 37.4%, and 31.3%, respectively, among Chinese high school students during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender was the higher risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms. In terms of grades, senior high school was a risk factor for depressive and anxiety symptoms; the higher the grade, the greater the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our findings show there is a high prevalence of psychological health problems among adolescents, which are negatively associated with the level of awareness of COVID-19. These findings suggest that the government needs to pay more attention to psychological health among adolescents while combating COVID-19.","Zhou, Zhang, Wang, Guo, Wang, Chen, Liu, Chen, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-020-01541-4","20200626","Adolescents; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Prevalence; Adolescent; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We offer nine research-supported, practitioner-friendly methods of self-care to manage anxiety and maintain optimal performance during these extraordinary times.","Norcross, Phillips","https://doi.org/10.1007/s42843-020-00010-5","20200507",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental healthcare for psychiatric inpatients during the COVID-19 epidemic","During this 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia epidemic, some experts have expressed concern for the mental healthcare of different types of population groups. However, hospitalised patients with severe mental illness are seemingly overlooked. Psychiatric patients are still a vulnerable group who need to obtain more attention and respect, particularly during the COVID-19 outbreak in China. In this commentary, we briefly introduce the situation of hospitalized patients with severe mental illness and suggest some effective measures that should be rapidly undertaken to reverse current challenges.","Li, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100216","20200507","mental health services; psychiatry; schizophrenia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health framework: coronavirus pandemic in post-Katrina New Orleans","The United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction defines disaster risk as the &quot;likelihood of loss of life, injury or destruction and damage from a disaster in a given period, and a product of the complex interactions that generate conditions of exposure, vulnerability and hazard&quot;. Racial and ethnic minorities in the United States have been shown to have increased vulnerability and risk to disasters due to links between racism, vulnerability, and economic power, based on disadvantage related to different disaster stages: 1) reduced perception of personal disaster risk; 2) lack of preparedness; 3) reduced access and response to warning systems; 4) increased physical impacts due to substandard housing; 5) likelihood of poorer psychological outcomes; 6) cultural insensitivity on the part of emergency workers; 7) marginalization, lower socio-economic status, and less familiarity with support resources leading to protracted recovery; and 8) diminished standard of living, job loss, and exacerbated poverty during reconstruction and community rebuilding. Moreover, given that psychiatric morbidity is predictable in populations exposed to disasters, mental health and psychosocial support programs should increasingly become a standard part of a humanitarian response. In the crisis and immediate recovery phase of disasters, the focus should be on making survivors feel safe and giving them assistance in decreasing their anxiety by addressing their basic needs and welfare. So, it is critical that governmental institutions, business, and non-profit organizations proactively find mechanisms to work collaboratively and share resources. Special attention and extra resources must be directed towards vulnerable and marginalized populations. In this editorial we share lessons learned from experiencing disproportionate impact of health crisis and advocate for the notion that recovery efforts must address trauma at individual, interpersonal and community levels, and be based in a healing justice framework.","Shervington, Richardson","https://doi.org/10.5249/jivr.v12i2.1538","20200503",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). Ï‡<sup>2</sup> test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.","Cai, Lian, Song, Hou, Deng, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111","20200601","Corona Virus Disease 2019; Health care workers; Mental health; Resilience","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mitigating the Psychological Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers: A Digital Learning Package","The coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) will undoubtedly have psychological impacts for healthcare workers, which could be sustained; frontline workers will be particularly at risk. Actions are needed to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by protecting and promoting the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers during and after the outbreak. We developed and evaluated a digital learning package using Agile methodology within the first three weeks of UK outbreak. This e-package includes evidence-based guidance, support and signposting relating to psychological wellbeing for all UK healthcare employees. A three-step rapid development process included public involvement activities (PPIs) (STEP 1), content and technical development with iterative peer review (STEP 2), and delivery and evaluation (STEP 3). The package outlines the actions that team leaders can take to provide psychologically safe spaces for staff, together with guidance on communication and reducing social stigma, peer and family support, signposting others through psychological first aid (PFA), self-care strategies (e.g., rest, work breaks, sleep, shift work, fatigue, healthy lifestyle behaviours), and managing emotions (e.g., moral injury, coping, guilt, grief, fear, anxiety, depression, preventing burnout and psychological trauma). The e-package includes advice from experts in mental wellbeing as well as those with direct pandemic experiences from the frontline, as well as signposting to public mental health guidance. Rapid delivery in STEP 3 was achieved via direct emails through professional networks and social media. Evaluation included assessment of fidelity and implementation qualities. Essential content was identified through PPIs (<i>n</i> = 97) and peer review (<i>n</i> = 10) in STEPS 1 and 2. The most important messages to convey were deemed to be normalisation of psychological responses during a crisis, and encouragement of self-care and help-seeking behaviour. Within 7 days of completion, the package had been accessed 17,633 times, and healthcare providers had confirmed immediate adoption within their health and wellbeing provisions. Evaluation (STEP 3, <i>n</i> = 55) indicated high user satisfaction with content, usability and utility. Assessment of implementation qualities indicated that the package was perceived to be usable, practical, low cost and low burden. Our digital support package on 'psychological wellbeing for healthcare workers' is free to use, has been positively evaluated and was highly accessed within one week of release. It is available here: Supplementary Materials. This package was deemed to be appropriate, meaningful and useful for the needs of UK healthcare workers. We recommend provision of this e-package to healthcare workers alongside wider strategies to support their psychological wellbeing during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Blake, Bermingham, Johnson, Tabner","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17092997","20200508","COVID-19; coronavirus; digital; e-learning; mental health; pandemic; wellbeing; Adaptation, Psychological; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Health Personnel; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of Home Quarantine on Physical Activity Among Older Adults Living at Home During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Qualitative Interview Study","Older adults and those with pre-existing medical conditions are at risk of death from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). In this period of quarantine, one of the reasons for going out is physical activity. This issue is important, as the impact of a sedentary lifestyle might be lower for children and young adults, but is far more severe for older adults. Although older adults need to stay at home because they have a higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), they need to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. Physical activity is important for older adults, especially to maintain their level of independence, mental health, and well-being. Maintaining mobility in old age is necessary, as it may predict loss of independence in older adults. Our first objective was to evaluate the impact of this quarantine period on physical activity programs and on the physical and mental health of older adults. Our second objective was to discuss alternatives to physical activity programs that could be suggested for this population to avoid a sedentary lifestyle. We conducted a qualitative survey using semistructured interviews with professionals (managers in charge of physical activity programs for older adults and sports trainers who run these physical activity programs) from the French Federation of Physical Education and Voluntary Gymnastics (FFPEVG) and older adults participating in a physical activity program of the FFPEVG. We followed a common interview guide. For analysis, we carried out a thematic analysis of the interviews. This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has affected, before quarantine measures, the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. In addition, despite the decline in their participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, older adults expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple and safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. We are concerned about the level of independence and mental health state of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity among them at home.","Goethals, Barth, Guyot, Hupin, Celarier, Bongue","https://doi.org/10.2196/19007","20200514","COVID-19; older adults; physical activity; social marketing","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Public Mental Health as One of the Key Factors in Dealing with COVID-19]","The aim of the article is to point out the important role of prevention and reduction of mental stress in the general population and in sensitive groups in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This article includes the analysis and evaluation of studies and recommendations from organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO) that have examined the psychological consequences of epidemics/pandemics on people and their impact on the further course. Fear-related behaviors can adversely affect the course of epidemics. Past outbreaks of infectious diseases (Ebola and Zika virus) have shown that maladaptive behavior, related to increased psychological stress and anxiety, can interfere with the implementation of treatment strategies and actions and can contribute to a further spread. Hereby, strategies for dealing with infectious diseases, that include the suppression of fear, can trigger a vicious circle in which fear and suppression mutually reinforce each other. The COVID-19 pandemic poses an immense challenge to governments, health systems and people, with an uncertain outcome, which is associated with a significant burden of mental health in the population. In line with WHO recommendations, national guidelines and preventive measures should include the psychological consequences, the acceptance and normalization of fears and the promotion of resilience in the population in dealing with COVID-19 in order to counteract a further spread. ZIEL: Das Ziel des Beitrages besteht darin, auf die bedeutsame Rolle der PrÃ¤vention und Reduktion der psychischen Belastungen in der AllgemeinbevÃ¶lkerung und in sensiblen Gruppen im Rahmen der Coronavirus-Krankheit-2019 (COVID-19) -Pandemie hinzuweisen. Der vorliegende Beitrag umfasst die Analyse und Bewertung von Studien und Empfehlungen von Organisationen wie der Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO), die die bevÃ¶lkerungsbezogenen psychischen Auswirkungen von Epi-/Pandemien und deren Einfluss auf den weiteren Verlauf untersucht haben. Angstbedingte Verhaltensweisen kÃ¶nnen sich negativ auf den Verlauf von Epidemien auswirken. Im Rahmen vergangener AusbrÃ¼che von Infektionskrankheiten (Ebola- und Zika-Virus) konnte ermittelt werden, dass maladaptive Verhaltensweisen, bedingt durch erhÃ¶hte psychische Belastungen und Ã„ngste, die Implementierung von Behandlungsstrategien und -maÃŸnahmen beeintrÃ¤chtigen und zu einer stÃ¤rkeren Ausbreitung beitragen kÃ¶nnen. Hierbei kÃ¶nnen Strategien im Umgang mit Infektionskrankheiten, die VerdrÃ¤ngung und UnterdrÃ¼ckung von Ã„ngsten beinhalten, einen Teufelskreis auslÃ¶sen, wobei Ã„ngste und VerdrÃ¤ngung sich gegenseitig verstÃ¤rken. Die COVID-19-Pandemie stellt eine immense Herausforderung mit noch ungewissem Ausgang fÃ¼r Regierungen, Gesundheitssysteme und Menschen dar, die mit erheblichen BeeintrÃ¤chtigungen der psychischen Gesundheit in der BevÃ¶lkerung verbunden ist. Im Einklang mit Empfehlungen der WHO sollten nationale Leitlinien und prÃ¤ventive MaÃŸnahmen die psychischen Auswirkungen, die Akzeptanz und Normalisierung von Ã„ngsten und die FÃ¶rderung von Resilienz in der BevÃ¶lkerung im Umgang mit COVID-19 umfassen, um einer weiteren Ausbreitung entgegenwirken zu kÃ¶nnen.","Hahad, Gilan, Daiber, MÃ¼nzel","https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1160-5770","20200529","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Germany; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Health; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A crisis within the crisis: The mental health situation of refugees in the world during the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","68.5 million people around the world have been forced to leave their houses. Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection. There should be not only a social mobilization to contain the virus, but also a collective effort on behalf of the most vulnerable populations.","JÃºnior, de Sales, Moreira, Pinheiro, Lima, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113000","20200519","Coronavirus infection; Mental health; Refugees; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Fear; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Refugees; Risk Factors; Sanitation; Uncertainty","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry","This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14Â days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (pÂ &lt;Â 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service.

"Severe psychological distress among patients with epilepsy during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China","To compare the severity of psychological distress between patients with epilepsy and healthy controls during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwest China, as well as identify potential risk factors of severe psychological distress among patients with epilepsy. This cross-sectional case-control study examined a consecutive sample of patients older than 15Â years treated at the epilepsy center of West China Hospital between February 1 and February 29, 2020. As controls, sex- and age-matched healthy visitors of inpatients (unrelated to the patients) were also enrolled during the same period. Data on demographics and attention paid to COVID-19 were collected by online questionnaire, data on epilepsy features were collected from electronic medical records, and psychological distress was evaluated using the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-6). Potential risk factors of severe psychological distress were identified using multivariate logistic regression. The 252 patients and 252 controls in this study were similar along all demographic variables except family income. Patients with epilepsy showed significantly higher K-6 scores than healthy controls and spent significantly more time following the COVID-19 outbreak (both PÂ &lt;Â .001). Univariate analyses associated both diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy and time spent paying attention to COVID-19 with severe psychological distress (defined as K-6 score &gt;12; both PÂ â‰¤Â .001). Multivariate logistic regression identified two independent predictors of severe psychological distress: time spent paying attention to COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.172, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.073-1.280) and diagnosis of drug-resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.283, 95% CI = 0.128-0.623). During public health outbreaks, clinicians and caregivers should focus not only on seizure control but also on mental health of patients with epilepsy, especially those with drug-resistant epilepsy. K-6 scores &gt; 12 indicate severe psychological distress. This may mean, for example, encouraging patients to engage in other activities instead of excessively following media coverage of the outbreak.","Hao, Zhou, Li, Zeng, Hao, Li, Li, Deng, Lin, Yan","https://doi.org/10.1111/epi.16544","20200625","COVID-19; drug-resistant epilepsy; epilepsy; outbreak; psychological distress; stress status; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Attention; Betacoronavirus; Case-Control Studies; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Drug Resistant Epilepsy; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental Health in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Emergency-The Italian Response","This article briefly reports the experience of mental health services and the lessons learned during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. In particular, this report offers opportunities to build on experience gained in managing the COVID-19 emergency in the Departments of Mental Health and Addiction (DMHAs) in Lombardy, the wealthiest Italian region, which has approximately 10 million inhabitants. Italy has a National Mental Health System divided into 134 DMHAs, 27 of which are in Lombardy. In the 4 weeks after the epidemic started, important changes occurred in the management of DMHAs in Lombardy. Many challenges have occurred in the management of health services. In many hospitals, entire wards, including some psychiatric wards, have been reorganized to admit patients with COVID-19, and many physicians and nurses have been diverted to wards managing patients with COVID-19. Most day facilities for patients with psychiatric needs have been temporarily closed, whereas in residential facilities, patients who usually are free to come and go during the day have had to be confined in the facilities with very limited or no leave. These changes have produced considerable stresses on people with severe mental disorders. Many outpatient clinics have limited appointments to those with the most urgent cases, and home visits, a common practice in most DMHAs, have been drastically reduced with potentially detrimental consequences for patients' well-being. Another potential detrimental consequence of being forced to stay at home has been an increase in the hours spent face to face with families with high amounts of conflict. Departments of Mental Health need to be equipped with appropriate e-health technologies and procedures to cope with situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, interventions are needed to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of quarantine. Departments of Mental Health should be able to assume a leadership position in the psychosocial management of disasterlike situations, and this requires the acquisition of new skills, notably how to correctly inform the population about risk, train and disseminate effective preventive and management procedures for disasters, support health personnel and rescuers, and support those experiencing bereavement.","de Girolamo, Cerveri, Clerici, Monzani, Spinogatti, Starace, Tura, Vita","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.1276","20200430",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Immediate and long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on delivery of surgical services","The ongoing pandemic is having a collateral health effect on delivery of surgical care to millions of patients. Very little is known about pandemic management and effects on other services, including delivery of surgery. This was a scoping review of all available literature pertaining to COVID-19 and surgery, using electronic databases, society websites, webinars and preprint repositories. Several perioperative guidelines have been issued within a short time. Many suggestions are contradictory and based on anecdotal data at best. As regions with the highest volume of operations per capita are being hit, an unprecedented number of operations are being cancelled or deferred. No major stakeholder seems to have considered how a pandemic deprives patients with a surgical condition of resources, with patients disproportionally affected owing to the nature of treatment (use of anaesthesia, operating rooms, protective equipment, physical invasion and need for perioperative care). No recommendations exist regarding how to reopen surgical delivery. The postpandemic evaluation and future planning should involve surgical services as an essential part to maintain appropriate surgical care for the population during an outbreak. Surgical delivery, owing to its cross-cutting nature and synergistic effects on health systems at large, needs to be built into the WHO agenda for national health planning. Patients are being deprived of surgical access, with uncertain loss of function and risk of adverse prognosis as a collateral effect of the pandemic. Surgical services need a contingency plan for maintaining surgical care in an ongoing or postpandemic phase.","SÃ¸reide, Hallet, Matthews, Schnitzbauer, Line, Lai, Otero, Callegaro, Warner, Baxter, Teh, Ng-Kamstra, Meara, Hagander, Lorenzon","https://doi.org/10.1002/bjs.11670","20200605",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Agile Requirements Engineering and Software Planning for a Digital Health Platform to Engage the Effects of Isolation Caused by Social Distancing: Case Study","Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool's feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app's feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura's model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness.","Meinert, Milne-Ives, Surodina, Lam","https://doi.org/10.2196/19297","20200513","COVID-19; aged; agile; app; artificial intelligence; cellphone; coronavirus; data science; digital health; exercise; health care quality, access and evaluation; information science; mental health; public reporting of healthcare data; requirements engineering; social distancing; telemedicine; Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Engineering; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Distance; Software; Technology; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Coronavirus (COVID-19) in the United Kingdom: A personality-based perspective on concerns and intention to self-isolate","Objectives Public behaviour change is necessary to contain the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. Design Cross-sectional psychometric. Methods UK respondents (NÂ =Â 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST-PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio-economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self-isolation. Results Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR-related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward-related displacement activity. Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Conclusions Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive-approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight-flight-freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self-isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self-isolate. Results suggest psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF-related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable life (RR-related).

"Survey of Insomnia and Related Social Psychological Factors Among Medical Staff Involved in the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak","The outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) not only caused particularly large public health problems, but also caused great psychological distress, especially for medical staff. We aimed to investigate the prevalence rate of insomnia and to confirm the related social psychological factors among medical staff in hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak. Medical staff members in China were recruited, including frontline medical workers. The questionnaire, administered through the WeChat program, obtained demographic data and asked self-design questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak, insomnia/depressive/anxiety symptoms, and stress-related symptoms. We used a logistic regression analysis to examine the associations between sociodemographic factors and insomnia symptoms. There were a total of 1,563 participants in our study. Five-hundred-and-sixty-four (36.1%) participants had insomnia symptoms according to the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) (total score â‰¥ 8). A multiple binary logistic regression model revealed that insomnia symptoms were associated with an education level of high school or below (OR = 2.69, <i>p</i> = 0.042, 95% CI = 1.0-7.0), being a doctor (OR = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.007, 95% CI = 0.2-0.8), currently working in an isolation unit (OR = 1.71, <i>p</i> = 0.038, 95% CI = 1.0-2.8), is worried about being infected (OR = 2.30, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI = 1.6-3.4), perceived lack of helpfulness in terms of psychological support from news or social media with regard to COVID-19 (OR = 2.10, <i>p</i> = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.3-3.3), and having very strong uncertainty regarding effective disease control (OR = 3.30, <i>p</i> = 0.013, 95% CI = 1.3-8.5). Our study found that more than one-third of the medical staff suffered insomnia symptoms during the COVID-19 outbreak. The related factors included education level, an isolation environment, psychological worries about the COVID-19 outbreak, and being a doctor. Interventions for insomnia among medical staff are needed considering the various sociopsychological factors at play in this situation.","Zhang, Yang, Liu, Ma, Wang, Cai, Du, Li, Kang, Su, Zhang, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00306","20200505","COVID-19; insomnia; isolation; medical staff; mental health; outbreak; sleep quality; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Battle Buddies: Rapid Deployment of a Psychological Resilience Intervention for Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its rapid global spread have created unprecedented challenges to health care systems. Significant and sustained efforts have focused on mobilization of personal protective equipment, intensive care beds, and medical equipment, while substantially less attention has focused on preserving the psychological health of the medical workforce tasked with addressing the challenges of the pandemic. And yet, similar to battlefield conditions, health care workers are being confronted with ongoing uncertainty about resources, capacities, and risks; as well as exposure to suffering, death, and threats to their own safety. These conditions are engendering high levels of fear and anxiety in the short term, and place individuals at risk for persistent stress exposure syndromes, subclinical mental health symptoms, and professional burnout in the long term. Given the potentially wide-ranging mental health impact of COVID-19, protecting health care workers from adverse psychological effects of the pandemic is critical. Therefore, we present an overview of the potential psychological stress responses to the COVID-19 crisis in medical providers and describe preemptive resilience-promoting strategies at the organizational and personal level. We then describe a rapidly deployable Psychological Resilience Intervention founded on a peer support model (Battle Buddies) developed by the United States Army. This intervention-the product of a multidisciplinary collaboration between the Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry &amp; Behavioral Sciences at the University of Minnesota Medical Center-also incorporates evidence-informed &quot;stress inoculation&quot; methods developed for managing psychological stress exposure in providers deployed to disasters. Our multilevel, resource-efficient, and scalable approach places 2 key tools directly in the hands of providers: (1) a peer support Battle Buddy; and (2) a designated mental health consultant who can facilitate training in stress inoculation methods, provide additional support, or coordinate referral for external professional consultation. In parallel, we have instituted a voluntary research data-collection component that will enable us to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness while also identifying the most salient resilience factors for future iterations. It is our hope that these elements will provide guidance to other organizations seeking to protect the well-being of their medical workforce during the pandemic. Given the remarkable adaptability of human beings, we believe that, by promoting resilience, our diverse health care workforce can emerge from this monumental challenge with new skills, closer relationships, and greater confidence in the power of community.","Albott, Wozniak, McGlinch, Wall, Gold, Vinogradov","https://doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000004912","20200625","Burnout, Professional; Coronavirus Infections; Health Personnel; Hospital Units; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Our periodic strategies in dealing with Covid-19 were described in detail. An administrative response including the establishment of Emergency Leadership Committee that was in full charge of management was established. Modifications of infrastructure including the Fever Clinic, inpatient ward, outpatient clinic and operation room were carried out. Special arrangements for outpatient services, hospitalization and surgeries were introduced. Medical personnel training and patient educations were performed. Initiations of Covid-19 researches and application of information technology were introduced. Since January 16, three cases have been confirmed in our hospital and no healthcare-associated infection was found. During the epidemics, 6.46% staffs suffered depression, 9.87% had anxiety, and 98% were satisfied with the infection control policy. Shortages in staffs and medical consumables, and limitation in space were the obstacles we encountered. As the cost of in-hospital transmission is unbearable, our experiences and lessons suggested that prompt actions should be taken immediately to decrease or eliminate potential in-hospital transmission.

"Covid-19 pandemic by the &quot;real-time&quot; monitoring: the Tunisian case and lessons for global epidemics in the context of 3PM strategies","Covid-19 is neither the first nor the last viral epidemic which societies around the world are, were and will be affected by. Which lessons should be taken from the current pandemic situation? The Covid-19 disease is still not well characterised, and many research teams all over the world are working on prediction of the epidemic scenario, protective measures to populations and sub-populations, therapeutic and vaccination issues, amongst others. Contextually, countries with currently low numbers of Covid-19-infected individuals such as Tunisia are intended to take lessons from those countries which already reached the exponential phase of the infection distribution as well as from those which have the exponential phase behind them and record a minor number of new cases such as China. To this end, in Tunisia, the pandemic wave has started with a significant delay compared with Europe, the main economic partner of the country. In this paper, we do analyse the current pandemic situation in this country by studying the infection evolution and considering potential protective strategies to prevent a pandemic scenario. The model is predictive based on a large number of undetected Covid-19 cases that is particularly true for some country regions such as Sfax. Infection distribution and mortality rate analysis demonstrate a highly heterogeneous picture over the country. Qualitative and quantitative comparative analysis leads to a conclusion that the reliable &quot;real-time&quot; monitoring based on the randomised laboratory tests is the optimal predictive strategy to create the most effective evidence-based preventive measures. In contrast, lack of tests may lead to incorrect political decisions causing either unnecessary over-protection of the population that is risky for a long-term economic recession, or under-protection of the population leading to a post-containment pandemic rebound. Recommendations are provided in the context of advanced predictive, preventive and personalised (3P)Â medical approach.","Chaari, Golubnitschaja","https://doi.org/10.1007/s13167-020-00207-0","20200430","Anti-body; Anti-gene; Bottle-neck; Comorbidities; Covid-19; Depression; Economy; Epidemics; Ethics; Home isolation; Individual outcomes; Infection; Laboratory medicine; Multi-professional expertise; Pandemic; Policymaking; Population screening; Predictive preventive personalised (3P) medicine; Psychotic attitude; Related mortality; SARS-CoV-2; Salami-tactic; Strategy; Suicide; Suppressed immune defence; Targeted protective measures; Test; Titanic; Triage; Violence; â€œReal-timeâ€ monitoring","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Doctors experience high levels of work stress even under normal circumstances, but many would be reluctant to disclose mental health difficulties or seek help for them, with stigma an often-cited reason. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis places additional pressure on doctors and on the healthcare system in general and research shows that such pressure brings a greater risk of psychological distress for doctors. For this reason, we argue that the authorities and healthcare executives must show strong leadership and support for doctors and their families during the COVID-19 outbreak and call for efforts to reduce mental health stigma in clinical workplaces. This can be facilitated by deliberately adding â€˜healthcare staff mental health support processâ€™ as an ongoing agenda item to high-level management planning meetings.","Galbraith, Boyda, McFeeters, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjb.2020.44","20200701","COVID-19; coronavirus; doctors; healthcare professionals; mental health","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Quantitative studies (including letters to the editor) published from January to March 2020 were included. 14 studies on healthcare workers in departments of infectiology, internal medicine, and fever wards including intensive care wards as well as surgery and psychiatry, were included. The Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ9), Self-rating-Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Impact of Event Scale (IES-R) were the most often used test instruments. The sample size ranged between 37 and 1257 participants consisting of mostly nursing and medical personnel. The fraction of COVID-19-associated activities varied from 7.5â€Š% to 100â€Š%. An extensive strain was reported due to stress experience as well as depression and anxiety symptoms. Severe degrees of those symptoms were found in 2.2â€Š% to 14.5â€Š% of all participants. The severity of mental symptoms was influenced by age, gender, occupation, specialization, type of activities performed and proximity to COVID-19 patients. As mediator variables selection of personnel, preventive interventions, resilience, and social support were reported. Considering the frequency of mental symptoms occurring in healthcare workers, accompanying mental health informed interventions to facilitate coping are necessary.

"Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic-A review","The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.","Spoorthy, Pratapa, Mahant","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119","20200605","COVID-19; Health care workers; Psychological; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Comparison of Prevalence and Associated Factors of Anxiety and Depression Among People Affected by versus People Unaffected by Quarantine During the COVID-19 Epidemic in Southwestern China","BACKGROUND At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and spread rapidly to the whole country within 1 month. This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as 'affected group' and 'unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population's mental state.","Lei, Huang, Zhang, Yang, Yang, Xu","https://doi.org/10.12659/MSM.924609","20200428","Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quarantine; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Is returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic stressful? A study on immediate mental health status and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of Chinese workforce","This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. &gt;95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (pÂ &lt;Â 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tan, Hao, McIntyre, Jiang, Jiang, Zhang, Zhao, Zou, Hu, Luo, Zhang, Lai, Ho, Tran, Ho, Tam","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055","20200702","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Depression; Insomnia; Occupational health mental health; PTSD; Pandemic; Quarantine; Stress; Suicide; Workers; Workforce; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Hand Hygiene; Health Status; Humans; Male; Marital Status; Masks; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychoneuroimmunology; Return to Work; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Ventilation; Workplace; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A qualitative study on the psychological experience of caregivers of COVID-19 patients","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff. To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.","Sun, Wei, Shi, Jiao, Song, Ma, Wang, Wang, Wang, You, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018","20200529","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); Epidemic outbreak; Nurse; Psychological experience; Qualitative study; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Caregivers; Coronavirus Infections; Data Collection; Emotions; Fatigue; Fear; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Qualitative Research","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Ayurveda and COVID-19: Where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an &quot;immune booster&quot;, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the &quot;meaning response&quot; described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.","Rajkumar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056","20200702","Ayurveda; COVID-19; Meaning response; Psychoneuroimmunology; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coriandrum; Coronavirus Infections; Cuminum; Curcuma; Depression; Garlic; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; India; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Pandemics; Plant Preparations; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Psychoneuroimmunology; Spices; Stress, Psychological; Teas, Herbal; Yoga","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Recommendations for Deep Brain Stimulation Device Management During a Pandemic","Most medical centers are postponing elective procedures and deferring non-urgent clinic visits to conserve hospital resources and prevent spread of COVID-19. The pandemic crisis presents some unique challenges for patients currently being treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS). Movement disorder (Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia), neuropsychiatric disorder (obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, depression), and epilepsy patients can develop varying degrees of symptom worsening from interruption of therapy due to neurostimulator battery reaching end of life, device malfunction or infection. Urgent intervention to maintain or restore stimulation may be required for patients with Parkinson's disease who can develop a rare but potentially life-threatening complication known as DBS-withdrawal syndrome. Similarly, patients with generalized dystonia can develop status dystonicus, patients with obsessive compulsive disorder can become suicidal, and epilepsy patients can experience potentially life-threatening worsening of seizures as a result of therapy cessation. DBS system infection can require urgent, and rarely emergent surgery. Elective interventions including new implantations and initial programming should be postponed. For patients with existing DBS systems, the battery status and electrical integrity interrogation can now be performed using patient programmers, and employed through telemedicine visits or by phone consultations. The decision for replacement of the implantable pulse generator to prevent interruption of DBS therapy should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration battery status and a patient's tolerance to potential therapy disruption. Scheduling of the procedures, however, depends heavily on the hospital system regulations and on triage procedures with respect to safety and resource utilization during the health crisis.","Miocinovic, Ostrem, Okun, Bullinger, Riva-Posse, Gross, Buetefisch","https://doi.org/10.3233/JPD-202072","20200425","COVID-19; DBS withdrawal; battery depletion; coronavirus; telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54-5.07, pÂ =Â 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36-3.48, pÂ =Â 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27-7.41, pÂ =Â 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12-4.35, pÂ =Â 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","Chew, Lee, Tan, Jing, Goh, Ngiam, Yeo, Ahmad, Ahmed Khan, Napolean Shanmugam, Sharma, Komalkumar, Meenakshi, Shah, Patel, Chan, Sunny, Chandra, Ong, Paliwal, Wong, Sagayanathan, Chen, Ying Ng, Teoh, Tsivgoulis, Ho, Ho, Sharma","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049","20200427","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Healthcare workers; Pandemic; Physical symptoms; Psychological impact; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[An analysis of global research on SARS-CoV-2]","The SARS-CoV-2 has been spread to 26 countries around the world since its outbreak. By February 16, 2020, more than 68 000 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Researchers from all over the world have carried out timely studies on this public health emergency and produced a number of scientific publications. This review aims to re-analyze and summarize the current research findings in a timely manner to guide scholars in relevant fields to further SARS-CoV-2 research and assist healthcare professionals in their work and decision-making. The SARS-CoV-2 related terms were selected in both English and Chinese and were searched in several major databases, including Pubmed, Web of Science, CNKI, Wanfang, and VIP databases. The reference list of each search result was screened for relevance, which was further supplemented to the search results. The included studies were categorized by topics with key characteristics extracted, re-analyzed, and summarized. A total of 301 articles were finally included with 136 in Chinese and 165 in English. The number of publications has rapidly increased since mid-January, 2020, and a peak day was 6th February on which 50 articles were published. The top three countries publishing articles were China, the United States and the United Kingdom. The <i>Lancet</i> and its specialty journals have published the most articles, with contribution also from journals such as <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> ( <i>NEJM</i>), <i>The Journal of the American Medical Association</i> ( <i>JAMA</i>), and <i>Nature</i>. All articles were categorized into epidemiology, clinical diagnosis and treatment, basic research, pregnant women and children, mental health, epidemic prevention &amp; control, and others. The literatures related to SARS-CoV-2 are emerging rapidly. It is necessary to sort out and summarize the research topic in time, which has a good reference value for staff in different positions.

"Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (&gt;13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQÂ +Â azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQÂ +Â amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of â‰¥2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29-2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80-4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQÂ +Â azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80-7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.","Sarayani, Cicali, Henriksen, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016","20200427","Azithromycin; COVID-19; Hydroxychloroquine; QT prolongation; SARS-CoV-2; Torsades de Pointes","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"PTSD as the second tsunami of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic","Since the first cases, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly spread around the world, with hundred-thousand cases and thousands of deaths. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common consequence of major disasters. Exceptional epidemic situations also promoted PTSD in the past. Considering that humanity is undergoing the most severe pandemic since Spanish Influenza, the actual pandemic of COVID-19 is very likely to promote PTSD. Moreover, COVID-19 was renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2). With a poor understanding of viruses and spreading mechanisms, the evocation of SARS is generating a great anxiety contributing to promote PTSD. Quarantine of infected patients evolved to quarantine of 'infected' towns or popular districts, and then of entire countries. In the families of cases, the brutal death of family members involved a spread of fear and a loss of certainty, promoting PTSD. In the context of disaster medicine with a lack of human and technical resources, healthcare workers could also develop acute stress disorders, potentially degenerating into chronic PTSD. Globally, WHO estimates 30-50% of the population affected by a disaster suffered from diverse psychological distress. PTSD individuals are more at-risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and deaths by suicide - considering that healthcare workers are already at-risk occupations. We draw attention towards PTSD as a secondary effect of the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, both for general population, patients, and healthcare workers. Healthcare policies need to take into account preventive strategy of PTSD, and the related risk of suicide, in forthcoming months.","Dutheil, Mondillon, Navel","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291720001336","20200507",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Generalized anxiety disorder, depressive symptoms and sleep quality during COVID-19 outbreak in China: a web-based cross-sectional survey","China has been severely affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019(COVID-19) since December, 2019. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (&lt; 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (â‰¥ 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak. Younger people, people spending too much time thinking about the outbreak, and healthcare workers were at high risk of mental illness. Continuous surveillance of the psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of preparedness efforts worldwide.","Huang, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112954","20200519","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Mental health; Sleep; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (nÂ =Â 500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; pÂ =Â 0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ &quot;Need for approval&quot; (OR: 1.08; pÂ =Â 0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ &quot;Confidence&quot; (OR: 0.89; pÂ =Â 0.002) and &quot;Discomfort with closeness&quot; were protective (OR: 0.92; pÂ =Â 0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; pÂ =Â 0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; pÂ =Â 0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ &quot;Confidence&quot; (OR: 0.92; pÂ =Â 0.039) and &quot;Discomfort with closeness&quot; (OR: 0.94; pÂ =Â 0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.","Moccia, Janiri, Pepe, Dattoli, Molinaro, De Martin, Chieffo, Janiri, Fiorillo, Sani, Di Nicola","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.048","20200702","Gender effect; General population; Personality; SARS-CoV-2; Stress response; Adolescent; Adult; Affect; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cyclothymic Disorder; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Object Attachment; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Severity of Illness Index; Stress, Psychological; Temperament; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Neuropsychiatric adverse events of chloroquine: a real-world pharmacovigilance study using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database","In late March and early April 2020, the antimalarial drug, chloroquine, has been approved as an emergency treatment for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and in Europe. Although infrequent, neuropsychiatric symptoms have been reported in patients who received chloroquine for the treatment of malaria or autoimmune diseases. In this study, aiming to investigate these adverse events (AEs) using a large self-reporting database, we conducted a disproportionality analysis for the detection of neuropsychiatric AE signals associated with the use of chloroquine (or hydroxychloroquine), reported to FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database between the fourth quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2019. We included 2,389,474 AE cases, among which 520 cases developed neuropsychiatric AE following the use of chloroquine. Adjusted reporting odds ratio (ROR) for the development of each of the neuropsychiatric AEs following the use of chloroquine was calculated using a multilevel model: exposure to chloroquine was associated with a statistically significant high reporting of amnesia, delirium, hallucinations, depression, and loss of consciousness, (lower 95% confidence interval of the adjusted ROR &gt; 1), although the degree of increase in their ROR was limited. There was no statistically significant high reporting of any other neuropsychiatric AE, including suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation. Current pharmacovigilance study results did not suggest any potential link between the use of chloroquine and an increased risk of suicide, psychosis, confusion, and agitation, which would be informative during the emergency use of chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19.","Sato, Mano, Iwata, Toda","https://doi.org/10.5582/bst.2020.03082","20200522","COVID-19; FAERS; adverse events; chloroquine; pharmacovigilance; real-world data; Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting Systems; Aged; Betacoronavirus; Chloroquine; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Pharmacovigilance; Retrospective Studies; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Effect of COVID-19 on Youth Mental Health","The purposes of this study was to assess the youth mental health after the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) occurred in China two weeks later, and to investigate factors of mental health among youth groups. A cross-sectional study was conducted two weeks after the occurrence of COVID-19 in China. A total of 584 youth enrolled in this study and completed the question about cognitive status of COVID-19, the General Health Questionnaire(GHQ-12), the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C) and the Negative coping styles scale. Univariate analysis and univariate logistic regression were used to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on youth mental health. The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that nearly 40.4% the sampled youth were found to be prone to psychological problems and 14.4% the sampled youth with Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Univariate logistic regression revealed that youth mental health was significantly related to being less educated (ORâ€‰=â€‰8.71, 95%CI:1.97-38.43), being the enterprise employee (ORâ€‰=â€‰2.36, 95%CI:1.09-5.09), suffering from the PTSD symptomÂ (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.05, 95%CI:1.03-1.07) and using negative coping stylesÂ (ORâ€‰=â€‰1.03, 95%CI:1.00-1.07). Results of this study suggest that nearly 40.4% of the youth group had a tendency to have psychological problems. Thus, this was a remarkable evidence that infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, may have an immense influence on youth mental health. Therefor, local governments should develop effective psychological interventions for youth groups, moreover, it is important to consider the educational level and occupation of the youth during the interventions.","Liang, Ren, Cao, Hu, Qin, Li, Mei","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-020-09744-3","20200508","COVID-19; Mental health; Negative coping styles; Post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Systematic rapid &quot;living&quot; review on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19: update to March 31st, 2020","The outbreak of COVID-19 epidemics has challenged the provision of health care worldwide, highlighting the main flaws of some national health systems with respect to their capacity to cope with the needs of frail subjects. People experiencing disability due to COVID-19 express specific rehabilitation needs that deserve a systematic evidence-based approach. The aim of this article is to provide the rehabilitation community with updates on the latest scientific literature on rehabilitation needs due to COVID-19. The first rapid &quot;living&quot; review will present the results of a systematic search performed up to March 31st, 2020. A systematic search in PubMed, Pedro, and Google Scholar was performed using the search terms: &quot;COVID-19,&quot; &quot;Coronavirus,&quot; &quot;severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2,&quot; &quot;rehabilitation,&quot; &quot;physical therapy modalities,&quot; &quot;exercise,&quot; &quot;occupational therapy,&quot; and &quot;late complications.&quot; Papers published up to March 31st, 2020, in English, were included. Out of the 2758 articles retrieved, nine were included in the present review. Four of them are &quot;calls for action&quot;, three provide recommendations about rehabilitation interventions in the acute phase, two address the needs of people quarantined at home or with restricted mobility due to the lockdown, and one provides a Core Outcome Set to be used in clinical trials to test the efficacy of health strategies in managing COVID-19 patients. All selected papers were based on previous literature and not on the current COVID-19 pandemic. Main messages included: 1) early rehabilitation should be granted to inpatients with COVID-19; 2) people with restricted mobility due to quarantine or lockdown should receive exercise programs to reduce the risk of frailty, sarcopenia, cognitive decline and depression; 3) telerehabilitation may represent the first option for people at home. Further updates are warranted in order to characterize the emerging disability in COVID-19 survivors and the adverse effects on the health of chronically disabled people.","Ceravolo, de Sire, Andrenelli, Negrini, Negrini","https://doi.org/10.23736/S1973-9087.20.06329-7","20200724","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Rehabilitation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Explore the Optimal Resolvent of Medical Needs and Mental Health for Patients with Lung Cancer during Epidemic Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia]","With the rapid spread of novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) worldwide and the escalation of prevention and control efforts, the routine medical needs of patients have been restricted. The aims were to investigate medical needs of lung cancer patients and their mental health status during the epidemic periods, so as to provide rational recommendations for subsequent diagnosis and treatment. The questionnaire was sent in the form of an electronic questionnaire at 7am on 4th, March, 2020, until 7am 6th, March, 2020, 368 questionnaires were recollected from 25 provinces (autonomous regions/municipalities) in 48 h. Of the 368 patients, 18 patients were excluded as they didn't receive anti-tumor treatment, and 350 patients were included in the final analysis. 229 cases were treated with oral targeted drugs, and 121 cases were treated with chemotherapy or immunotherapy. 41.3% of patients treated with intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy experienced treatment discontinuation, and the proportion of treatment discontinuation in chemotherapy or immunotherapy was higher than those treated with oral targeted drugs (21.0%). Whether oral targeted drugs or intravenous chemotherapy or immunotherapy, more than 60% of patients experienced delays in imaging examinations. Nearly one third of patients developed new symptoms or exacerbation of existing symptoms. 26.6%-28.9% of patients have changed their treatment plans through online consultation. During novel coronavirus pneumonia, 40%-75% of lung cancer patients have mental health problems, and more than 95% of patients support government's prevention and control measures. During the emergence of NCP, the medical needs of patients with lung cancer have not been enough, especially those who discontinued chemotherapy or immunotherapy. When medical institution resumes work, priority should be given to them.

"Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated Psychological Problems","The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China. Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21-40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).","Ahmed, Ahmed, Aibao, Hanbin, Siyu, Ahmad","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092","20200601","Alcohol use disorder; Anxiety; COVID-19; China; Depression; Epidemic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Medically unexplained symptoms in the times of Covid-19 pandemic: a case-report","In early 2020, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) leading to a potentially fatal condition was discovered. Since then, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread worldwide becoming a pandemic. Beyond the risks strictly related to the infection, concerns have been expressed for the psychological impact that COVID-19 may have, especially on vulnerable individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) is characterized by a dysfunctional preoccupation with physical symptoms leading to excessive and unnecessary healthcare utilization. Despite being quite common, such condition remains underrecognized. We report a detailed clinical case of a 16 years old adolescent, who presented with a history suggestive of COVID-19 infection and associated psychological distress. Despite testing negative for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, his extreme and persisting health preoccupations required an inpatient admission to the Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Unit. He responded rapidly to a low dose of antipsychotic and an antidepressant. Based on his medical history and current presentation, he received a diagnosis of SSD. When COVID-19-like symptoms occur, we highlight the importance of differentially diagnosing a possible exacerbation of a pre-existing SSD, triggered by fear of being infected. This may help preventing further burden to the healthcare system.","Colizzi, Bortoletto, Silvestri, Mondini, Puttini, Cainelli, Gaudino, Ruggeri, Zoccante","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100073","20200710","2019-nCoV; Anxiety; Child and Adolescent Psychiatry; Coronavirus; Obsessive Compulsive Symptoms; Somatic Symptom Disorder","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review]","The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14Â days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic. French mental healthcare is now in a great and urgent need for reorganization and must also prepare in the coming days and weeks to face an epidemic of emotional disorders due to the containment of the general population.","Chevance, Gourion, Hoertel, Llorca, Thomas, Bocher, Moro, LaprÃ©vote, Benyamina, Fossati, Masson, Leaune, Leboyer, Gaillard","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.03.001","20200713","Coronavirus; Covid-19; Epidemy; France; Pandemy; PandÃ©mie; Psychiatrie; Psychiatry; SARS-CoV-2; SantÃ© mentale; Ã‰pidÃ©mie; Aftercare; Age Factors; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Betacoronavirus; Child; Cognition Disorders; Comorbidity; Continuity of Patient Care; Coronavirus Infections; Drug Interactions; France; Hospital Units; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Infection Control; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Patient Care Team; Patient Compliance; Pneumonia, Viral; Prisoners; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicide; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Coronaviruses and people with intellectual disability: an exploratory data analysis","Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been announced as a new coronavirus disease by the World Health Organization. At the time of writing this article (April 2020), the world is drastically influenced by the COVID-19. Recently, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) was published. For researchers on ID such as ourselves, it is of key interest to learn whether this open research dataset may be used to investigate the virus and its consequences for people with an ID. From CORD-19, we identified full-text articles containing terms related to the ID care and applied a text mining technique, specifically the term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis in combination with K-means clustering. Two hundred fifty-nine articles contained one or more of our specified terms related to ID. We were able to cluster these articles related to ID into five clusters on different topics, namely: mental health, viral diseases, diagnoses and treatments, maternal care and paediatrics, and genetics. The CORD-19 open research dataset consists of valuable information about not only COVID-19 disease but also ID and the relationship between them. We suggest researchers investigate literature-based discovery approaches on the CORD-19 and develop a new dataset that addresses the intersection of these two fields for further research.","Tummers, Catal, Tobi, Tekinerdogan, Leusink","https://doi.org/10.1111/jir.12730","20200622","COVID-19; coronavirus; intellectual disability; machine learning; text mining; Bibliometrics; Coronavirus Infections; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Datasets as Topic; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Machine Learning; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Little is known about treatment options to combat the novel virus, but the same applies to the effects of COVID-19 on people's mental health. In Germany, as in many other countries, governmental actions impact peoples' individual freedom. These highly necessary actions to slow down the spread of the virus, however, are a burden to the community. We established a structured concept to support psychological burdened people in Essen, which is located in the Ruhr area, a metropolitan region with more than 5.1 million inhabitants in the heart of the federal state North Rhine Westphalia.

"When basic supplies are missing, what to do? Specific demands of the local street population in times of coronavirus - a concern of social psychiatry","Homeless experts and some federal housing officials are sounding the alarm that the patchwork of government efforts to address the coronavirus outbreak risks leaving out one group of acutely vulnerable people: the homeless. In terms of isolation, it is too unclear what that looks like if you normally sleep on the streets. In this tough moment, when people should be turned away, not only it feels inhumane, but it is also a big public health risk, because where are they going to go? The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation RESULTS: With more cities suspecting community transmission of the novel coronavirus, people who sleep in shelters or hunker down outside already have a lower life expectancy and often have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk if they develop COVID-19 (Global News, 2020). These people face lack of sleep, malnutrition, and &quot;extreme stress levels just to meet their daily needs&quot;, all of which weakens the immune system. Along with mental illness or substance abuse disorders, they are &quot;incredibly vulnerable to this virus&quot;. Health organizations are well aware of the risks involved in mental health. A large population of homeless people experience their pain and psychological distress intermittently. For low-income patients, the various borderline situations related to health/illness involve growing expectations regarding the basic needs. This is a serious concern when linked to the pandemic.","Neto, de Souza, Quezado, MendonÃ§a, de AraÃºjo, Luz, de Santana, Sampaio, Carvalho, Arrais, Landim, da Silva","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112939","20200519","2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Homeless; Social psychiatry; Adult; Betacoronavirus; Community Psychiatry; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Homeless Persons; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Social Isolation; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Multidisciplinary research priorities for the COVID-19 pandemic: a call for action for mental health science","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a profound effect on all aspects of society, including mental health and physical health. We explore the psychological, social, and neuroscientific effects of COVID-19 and set out the immediate priorities and longer-term strategies for mental health science research. These priorities were informed by surveys of the public and an expert panel convened by the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the mental health research charity, MQ: Transforming Mental Health, in the first weeks of the pandemic in the UK in March, 2020. We urge UK research funding agencies to work with researchers, people with lived experience, and others to establish a high level coordination group to ensure that these research priorities are addressed, and to allow new ones to be identified over time. The need to maintain high-quality research standards is imperative. International collaboration and a global perspective will be beneficial. An immediate priority is collecting high-quality data on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across the whole population and vulnerable groups, and on brain function, cognition, and mental health of patients with COVID-19. There is an urgent need for research to address how mental health consequences for vulnerable groups can be mitigated under pandemic conditions, and on the impact of repeated media consumption and health messaging around COVID-19. Discovery, evaluation, and refinement of mechanistically driven interventions to address the psychological, social, and neuroscientific aspects of the pandemic are required. Rising to this challenge will require integration across disciplines and sectors, and should be done together with people with lived experience. New funding will be required to meet these priorities, and it can be efficiently leveraged by the UK's world-leading infrastructure.

Fundamentally, these concerns ascend with all infections, including those of flu and other agents, and the same worldwide safeguards are compulsory and suggested for protection and the prevention of further diffusion. However, media has underlined COVID-19 as rather an exclusive threat, which has added to panic and stress in masses which can lead to several mental health issues like anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder which should be contained immediately in its initial phases.","Shuja, Aqeel, Jaffar, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.32","20200421","Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Global Health; Humans; Mass Media; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact of Human Disasters and COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health: Potential of Digital Psychiatry","Deep emotional traumas in societies overwhelmed by large-scale human disasters, like, global pandemic diseases, natural disasters, man-made tragedies, war conflicts, social crises, etc., can cause massive stress-related disorders. Motivated by the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, the article provides an overview of scientific evidence regarding adverse impact of diverse human disasters on mental health in afflicted groups and societies. Following this broader context, psychosocial impact of COVID-19 as a specific global human disaster is presented, with an emphasis on disturbing mental health aspects of the ongoing pandemic. Limited resources of mental health services in a number of countries around the world are illustrated, which will be further stretched by the forthcoming increase in demand for mental health services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health challenges are particularly important for the Republic of Croatia in the current situation, due to disturbing stress of the 2020 Zagreb earthquake and the high pre-pandemic prevalence of chronic Homeland-War-related posttraumatic stress disorders. Comprehensive approach based on digital psychiatry is proposed to address the lack of access to psychiatric services, which includes artificial intelligence, telepsychiatry and an array of new technologies, like internet-based computer-aided mental health tools and services. These tools and means should be utilized as an important part of the whole package of measures to mitigate negative mental health effects of the global coronavirus pandemic. Our scientific and engineering experiences in the design and development of digital tools and means in mitigation of stress-related disorders and assessment of stress resilience are presented. Croatian initiative on enhancement of interdisciplinary research of psychiatrists, psychologists and computer scientists on the national and EU level is important in addressing pressing mental health concerns related to the ongoing pandemic and similar human disasters.","Ä†osiÄ‡, PopoviÄ‡, Å arlija, KesedÅ¾iÄ‡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.25","20200421","Artificial Intelligence; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Croatia; Disasters; Humans; Internet; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychiatry; Telemedicine; User-Computer Interface","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Understanding how crisis influence an individual's reactions to stressful events (and vice versa) is important in order to create meaningful and effective interventions. Our literature search have revealed lack of the papers related to psychodynamic approach to recent crisis. Psychodynamic places a large emphasis on defense mechanisms and unconscious mind, where upsetting feelings, urges, and thoughts that are too painful for us to directly look at are housed. Even though these painful feelings and thoughts are outside of our awareness, they still influence our behavior in many ways. Optimal application of psychodynamic approach offers the frame for acceptance of psychological stress in a more positive way and benefits psychological growth. We believe that including psychodynamic approach in the national public and mental health emergency system will empower Croatia and the world during (and after) COVID-19 pandemic crisis.","MarÄinko, JakovljeviÄ‡, JakÅ¡iÄ‡, Bjedov, MindoljeviÄ‡ DrakuliÄ‡","https://doi.org/10.24869/psyd.2020.15","20200421","Betacoronavirus; Civil Defense; Coronavirus Infections; Croatia; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychoanalysis; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Health Communication Through News Media During the Early Stage of the COVID-19 Outbreak in China: Digital Topic Modeling Approach","In December 2019, a few coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases were first reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China. Soon after, increasing numbers of cases were detected in other parts of China, eventually leading to a disease outbreak in China. As this dreadful disease spreads rapidly, the mass media has been active in community education on COVID-19 by delivering health information about this novel coronavirus, such as its pathogenesis, spread, prevention, and containment. The aim of this study was to collect media reports on COVID-19 and investigate the patterns of media-directed health communications as well as the role of the media in this ongoing COVID-19 crisis in China. We adopted the WiseSearch database to extract related news articles about the coronavirus from major press media between January 1, 2020, and February 20, 2020. We then sorted and analyzed the data using Python software and Python package Jieba. We sought a suitable topic number with evidence of the coherence number. We operated latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling with a suitable topic number and generated corresponding keywords and topic names. We then divided these topics into different themes by plotting them into a 2D plane via multidimensional scaling. After removing duplications and irrelevant reports, our search identified 7791 relevant news reports. We listed the number of articles published per day. According to the coherence value, we chose 20 as the number of topics and generated the topics' themes and keywords. These topics were categorized into nine main primary themes based on the topic visualization figure. The top three most popular themes were prevention and control procedures, medical treatment and research, and global or local social and economic influences, accounting for 32.57% (n=2538), 16.08% (n=1258), and 11.79% (n=919) of the collected reports, respectively. Topic modeling of news articles can produce useful information about the significance of mass media for early health communication. Comparing the number of articles for each day and the outbreak development, we noted that mass media news reports in China lagged behind the development of COVID-19. The major themes accounted for around half the content and tended to focus on the larger society rather than on individuals. The COVID-19 crisis has become a worldwide issue, and society has become concerned about donations and support as well as mental health among others. We recommend that future work addresses the mass media's actual impact on readers during the COVID-19 crisis through sentiment analysis of news data.","Liu, Zheng, Zheng, Chen, Liu, Chen, Chu, Zhu, Akinwunmi, Huang, Zhang, Ming","https://doi.org/10.2196/19118","20200504","COVID-19; coronavirus; health communication; mass media; outbreak; public crisis; topic modeling; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Health Communication; Humans; Mass Media; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Public Opinion","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16-28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for more representative research from other affected countries, particularly in vulnerable populations.","Rajkumar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102066","20200622","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Public health; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health","According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health - these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.","AraÃºjo, de Lima, Cidade, Nobre, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977","20200519","COVID-19; Education; Mental Health; Adolescent; Anxiety; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Education, Distance; Humans; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; SARS Virus; Students; Uncertainty; Universities; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak","The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an &quot;enormous&quot; level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects.

"People experiencing homelessness: Their potential exposure to COVID-19","Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.","Lima, de Souza, Feitosa, Moreira, da Silva, Neto","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945","20200519","2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19); Mental health disorders; People experiencing homelessness; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Homeless Persons; Housing; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Vulnerable Populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Laboratory testing of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV): Current status, challenges, and countermeasures","Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are global public concerns. With the outbreak of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, China in December 2019, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 has been attracting tremendous attention. Rapid and accurate laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for early discovery, early reporting, early quarantine, early treatment, and cutting off epidemic transmission. The genome structure, transmission, and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 are basically similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the other two beta-CoVs of medical importance. During the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics, a variety of molecular and serological diagnostic assays were established and should be referred to for SARS-CoV-2. In this review, by summarizing the articles and guidelines about specimen collection, nucleic acid tests (NAT) and serological tests for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, several suggestions are put forward to improve the laboratory testing of SARS-CoV-2. In summary, for NAT: collecting stool and blood samples at later periods of illness to improve the positive rate if lower respiratory tract specimens are unavailable; increasing template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection; putting samples in reagents containing guanidine salt to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA; setting proper positive, negative and inhibition controls to ensure high-quality results; simultaneously amplifying human RNase P gene to avoid false-negative results. For antibody test, diverse assays targeting different antigens, and collecting paired samples are needed.","Yan, Chang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2106","20200519","MERS-CoV; SARS-CoV; SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV); nucleic acid testing; serological testing; specimen collection; Antibodies, Viral; Betacoronavirus; Clinical Laboratory Techniques; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Coronavirus Infections; DNA Primers; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Ribonuclease P; SARS Virus; Serologic Tests","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals' lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.","Troyer, Kohn, Hong","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027","20200702","COVID-19; Coronavirus pandemic; Post-viral neuropsychiatric sequelae; Public mental health; Acute Disease; Anxiety; Bacterial Translocation; Betacoronavirus; Chronic Disease; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokine Release Syndrome; Demyelinating Diseases; Depression; Humans; Immunologic Factors; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Nervous System Diseases; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychoneuroimmunology; Psychotic Disorders; Public Health; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861Â s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) after 4Â weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (&gt;24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (pÂ &gt;Â 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures.

"Mental health problems and social media exposure during COVID-19 outbreak","Huge citizens expose to social media during a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbroke in Wuhan, China. We assess the prevalence of mental health problems and examine their association with social media exposure. A cross-sectional study among Chinese citizens agedâ‰¥18 years old was conducted during Jan 31 to Feb 2, 2020. Online survey was used to do rapid assessment. Total of 4872 participants from 31 provinces and autonomous regions were involved in the current study. Besides demographics and social media exposure (SME), depression was assessed by The Chinese version of WHO-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5) and anxiety was assessed by Chinese version of generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7). multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify associations between social media exposure with mental health problems after controlling for covariates. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and combination of depression and anxiety (CDA) was 48.3% (95%CI: 46.9%-49.7%), 22.6% (95%CI: 21.4%-23.8%) and 19.4% (95%CI: 18.3%-20.6%) during COVID-19 outbroke in Wuhan, China. More than 80% (95%CI:80.9%-83.1%) of participants reported frequently exposed to social media. After controlling for covariates, frequently SME was positively associated with high odds of anxiety (OR = 1.72, 95%CI: 1.31-2.26) and CDA (OR = 1.91, 95%CI: 1.52-2.41) compared with less SME. Our findings show there are high prevalence of mental health problems, which positively associated with frequently SME during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"The Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 on Bariatric Surgery: Redefining Psychosocial Care","The global outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease has had a tremendous psychological impact on individuals around the world. Individuals with obesity are susceptible to distress and psychological sequalae secondary to this pandemic, which can have detrimental effects on obesity management. In particular, individuals undergoing bariatric surgery could experience increased emotional distress, resulting in increased eating psychopathology, mental health exacerbation, and difficulties with self-management. Addressing these challenges requires novel approaches to redefining psychosocial care before and after bariatric surgery. Emerging evidence suggests that the remote delivery of care using virtual care models, including mobile and online modalities, could extend the reach of psychosocial services to individuals after bariatric surgery and mitigate weight regain or impairment in quality of life. Because of this pandemic, the rapid integration of virtual psychosocial care in bariatric surgery programs to address patients' needs will create new opportunities for clinical and implementational scientific research.","Sockalingam, Leung, Cassin","https://doi.org/10.1002/oby.22836","20200615","Bariatric Surgery; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in Chinese psychiatric hospitals regarding COVID-19","On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus COVID-19 a pandemic. There are patients in psychiatric hospitals in China who have been infected with COVID-19, however, the knowledge and attitudes of psychiatric hospital staff towards infectious diseases and their willingness to work during the COVID-19 outbreak has not yet been investigated. This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff in two Chinese mental health centers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We included 141 psychiatrists and 170 psychiatric nurses in the study. We found that during the COVID-19 epidemic, 89.51% of the medical staff of the psychiatric hospitals studied had extensive knowledge of COVID-19, and 64.63% of them received the relevant training in hospitals. Furthermore, about 77.17% of participants expressed a willingness to care for psychiatric patients suffering from COVID-19 virus infection. Independent predictors of willingness to care for patients included advanced training and experience of caring for patients with COVID-19. In conclusion, this study suggests that increased attention should be paid to the knowledge and attitudes of medical staff at psychiatric hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Shi, Wang, Yang, Wang, Wang, Hashimoto, Zhang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100064","20200603","Attitudes; COVID-19; Knowledge; Nurses; Psychiatrists","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Following Law of the People's Republic of China on Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases and other related regulations, medical institutions have been authorized to collect the detailed information of patients, while it is still a formidable task in megacities because of the significant patient mobility and the existing information sharing barrier. As a smart city which strengthens precise epidemic prevention and control, Shanghai has established a multi-department platform named &quot;one-net management&quot; on dynamic information monitoring.

The overall prevalence of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and poor sleep quality were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. People aged &lt; 35 years reported a higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms than people aged â‰¥ 35 years. Healthcare workers have the highest rate of poor sleep compared to other occupations. Healthcare workers/younger people who spent a high level of time (â‰¥ 3 hours/day) had a particular higher prevalence of anxiety symptoms than in those who spent less time (&lt; 1 hours/day and 1-2 hours/day) on the outbreak. During the COVID-19 outbreak, healthcare workers and younger people were at an especially high-risk of displaying psychological impact when they spent too much time thinking about the outbreak.

"Study of knowledge, attitude, anxiety &amp; perceived mental healthcare need in Indian population during COVID-19 pandemic","Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety. Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received. The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively.

"Unprecedented disruption of lives and work: Health, distress and life satisfaction of working adults in China one month into the COVID-19 outbreak","We assess the health and wellbeing of normal adults living and working after one month of confinement to contain the COVID-19 outbreak in China. On Feb 20-21, 2020, we surveyed 369 adults in 64 cities in China that varied in their rates of confirmed coronavirus cases on their health conditions, distress and life satisfaction. 27% of the participants worked at the office, 38% resorted to working from home, and 25% stopped working due to the outbreak. Those who stopped working reported worse mental and physical health conditions as well as distress. The severity of COVID-19 in an individual's home city predicts their life satisfaction, and this relationship is contingent upon individuals' existing chronic health issues and their hours of exercise. Our evidence supports the need to pay attention to the health of people who were not infected by the virus, especially for people who stopped working during the outbreak. Our results highlight that physically active people might be more susceptible to wellbeing issues during the lockdown. Policymakers who are considering introducing restrictive measures to contain COVID-19 may benefit from understanding such health and wellbeing implications.","Zhang, Wang, Rauch, Wei","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112958","20200519","2019-nCoV; Coronavirus; Early evidence; Exercising hours; Life disruptions; Mental health; Physical health; Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Employment; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Personal Satisfaction; Pneumonia, Viral; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"&quot;We're staying at home&quot; Association of self-perceptions of aging, personal and family resources and loneliness with psychological distress during the lock-down period of COVID-19","Families are going through a very stressful time because of the COVID-19 outbreak, with age being a risk factor for this illness. Negative self-perceptions of aging, among other personal and relational variables may be associated with loneliness and distress caused by the pandemic crisis. Participants are 1310 Spanish people (age range: 18-88 years) during a lock-down period at home. In addition to specific questions about risk for COVID-19, self-perceptions of aging, family and personal resources, loneliness and psychological distress were measured. Hierarchical regression analyses were done for assessing the correlates of loneliness and psychological distress. The measured variables allow for an explanation of 48% and 33% of the variance of distress and loneliness, respectively. Being female, younger, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time exposed to news about COVID-19, more contact with relatives different to those that co-reside, fewer positive emotions, less perceived self-efficacy, lower quality of sleep, higher expressed emotion and higher loneliness were associated with higher distress. Being female, younger, having negative self-perceptions about aging, more time exposed to news about COVID-19, lower contact with relatives, higher self-perception as a burden, fewer positive emotions, lower resources for entertaining oneself, lower quality of sleep and higher expressed emotion were associated with higher loneliness.","Losada-Baltar, JimÃ©nez-Gonzalo, Gallego-Alberto, Pedroso-Chaparro, Fernandes-Pires, MÃ¡rquez-GonzÃ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa048","20200430","coping; crisis; depression; expressed emotion; self-efficacy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

On February 29, 2020, a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) passed away in a hospital in Seattle-King County, the first reported COVID-19-related death in the United States. That same day, a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in the county reported that several of its residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that many staff had symptoms compatible with COVID-19.The University of Washington Medicine health system (UW Medicine), which is based in Seattle-King County and provides quaternary care for the region, was one of several health care organizations called upon to address this growing crisis. What ensued was a series of swiftly enacted decisions and activities at UW Medicine, in partnership with local, state, and national public health agencies, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tapping into the multipronged mission areas of academic medicine, UW Medicine worked to support the community, innovate in science and clinical practice, lead policy and practice guideline development, and adopt changes as the crisis unfolded. In doing so, health system leaders had to balance their commitments to students, residents and fellows, researchers, faculty, staff, and hospital and health center entities, while ensuring that patients continued to receive cutting edge, high-quality, safe care. In this Invited Commentary, the authors highlight the work and challenges UW Medicine has faced in responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Lynch, Cohen, Neme, Staiger, Evans, Pergam, Liu, Bryson-Cahn, Dellit","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003410","20200424",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Attending to the Emotional Well-Being of the Health Care Workforce in a New York City Health System During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an enormous strain on health care workers, and its potential impact has implications for the physical and emotional well-being of the work force. As hospital systems run far over capacity, facing possible shortages of critical care medical resources and personal protective equipment as well as clinician deaths, the psychological stressors necessitate a strong well-being support model for staff. At the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York City, health care workers have been heroically providing front-line care to COVID-19 patients while facing their own appropriate fears for their personal safety in the setting of contagion. This moral obligation cannot be burdened by unacceptable risks; the health system's full support is required to address the needs of its workforce.In this Invited Commentary, the authors describe how an MSHS Employee, Faculty, and Trainee Crisis Support Task Force-created in early March 2020 and composed of behavioral health, human resources, and well-being leaders from across the health system-used a rapid needs assessment model to capture the concerns of the workforce related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The task force identified 3 priority areas central to promoting and maintaining the well-being of the entire MSHS workforce during the pandemic: meeting basic daily needs; enhancing communications for delivery of current, reliable, and reassuring messages; and developing robust psychosocial and mental health support options. Using a work group strategy, the task force operationalized the roll-out of support initiatives for each priority area. Attending to the emotional well-being of health care workers has emerged as a central element in the MSHS COVID-19 response, which continues to be committed to the physical and emotional needs of a workforce that courageously faces this crisis.","Ripp, Peccoralo, Charney","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000003414","20200424",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Home and Community-Based Physical Therapist Management of Adults With Post-Intensive Care Syndrome","More than 4 million adults survive a stay in the intensive care unit each year, with many experiencing new or worsening physical disability, mental health problems, and/or cognitive impairments, known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). Given the prevalence and magnitude of physical impairments after critical illness, many survivors, including those recovering from COVID-19, could benefit from physical therapist services after hospital discharge. However, due to the relatively recent recognition and characterization of PICS, there may be limited awareness and understanding of PICS among physical therapists practicing in home health care and community-based settings. This lack of awareness may lead to inappropriate and/or inadequate rehabilitation service provision. While this perspective article provides information relevant to all physical therapists, it is aimed toward those providing rehabilitation services outside of the acute and postacute inpatient settings. This article reports the prevalence and clinical presentation of PICS and provides recommendations for physical examination and outcomes measures, plan of care, and intervention strategies. The importance of providing patient and family education, coordinating community resources including referring to other health care team members, and community-based rehabilitation service options is emphasized. Finally, this perspective article discusses current challenges for optimizing outcomes for people with PICS and suggests future directions for research and practice.","Smith, Lee, Zeleznik, Coffey Scott, Fatima, Needham, Ohtake","https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzaa059","20200721","Ambulatory Care; Critical Illness; Outpatients; Post-Intensive Care Syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian Patients Switched to Remote Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic","A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done inÂ 2017. Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL.","Pulvirenti, Cinetto, Milito, Bonanni, Pesce, Leodori, Garzi, Miglionico, Tabolli, Quinti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003","20200611","Anxiety; COVID-19; COVID-19 epidemic; Common variable immunodeficiencies; Coronavirus; Depression; General Health Questionnaire; Health-related quality of life; Remote assistance; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Common Variable Immunodeficiency; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Female; Home Infusion Therapy; Humans; Immunoglobulins; Infusions, Subcutaneous; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Telemedicine; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological status of medical workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The pandemic of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has burdened an unprecedented psychological stress on people around the world, especiallyÂ the medical workforce. The study focuses on assess the psychological status of them. The authors conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires. Occurrence of fear, anxiety and depression were measured by the numeric rating scale (NRS) on fear, Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), respectively. A total of 2299 eligible participants were enrolled from the authors' institution, including 2042 medical staff and 257 administrative staff. The severity of fear, anxiety and depression were significantly different between two groups. Furthermore, as compared to the non-clinical staff, front line medical staff with close contact with infected patients, including working in the departments of respiratory,Â emergency,Â infectious disease, and ICU, showed higher scores on fear scale, HAMA and HAMD, and they were 1.4 times more likely to feel fear, twice more likely to suffer anxiety and depression. The medical staff especially working in above-mentioned departments made them more susceptible to psychological disorders. Effective strategies toward to improving the mental health should be provided to these individuals.","Lu, Wang, Lin, Li","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112936","20200519","Anxiety; Coronavirus pneumonia; Depression; Fear; Medical staff; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Fear; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Personnel, Hospital; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19: Hygiene and Public Health to the front","Public Health professionals and academics have been on the frontline of Italian history during the COVID-19 response like they never did before. Ancient professors of Hygiene such as Celli, Pagliani, Sclavo, Petragnani, Seppilli and Giovanardi flanked politicians in other critical moments. They helped them to manage healthcare reforms, earthquakes response, Seveso Dioxin disaster, cholera and poliomielitis epidemics and other health threats. Â The ongoing COVID-19 epidemic has highlighted the paramount importance of the practical application of basic concepts of public health, which were considered so far became obsolete, such as personal hygiene, quarantine, individual protective devices or basic epidemiological measures. Hygiene and Public Health used to have a targeted audience in professionals and lecturers. Nowadays, these topics are critical and of concern of a much larger audience. Public Health women and men are now asked to act in task forces, media broadcasts, webinars and consulting activities. Â In phase 2 of this epidemic - which is about to begin when this volume is to be published - the role of Public Health professionals could become even more relevant. However, this unexpected season must be managed with seriousness and intelligence, capitalizing it also for the future. If our Post-Graduate Schools of Public Health (&quot;Igiene e Medicina Preventiva&quot;), our scientific associations, our academic lecturers and our officers do not prove to be up to the situation, a dull future for the discipline might very well be. On the contrary, if as we all hope, we will be able to ride the wave of a dramatic health crisis, transforming it into a relevant scientific and professional opportunity, then we will be able to build on the post-COVID-19 a cutting-edge, a more attractive, relevant and modern discipline. This Supplement of Acta Biomedica, planned before the onset of the epidemic emergency in Italy, but already successful in presenting two papers on COVID-19, is further proof of how current and lively our discipline is.","Signorelli, Fara","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v91i3-S.9507","20200416","Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Emergencies; Humans; Hygiene; Italy; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Protective Devices; Public Health; Quarantine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental Health and Psychosocial Problems of Medical Health Workers during the COVID-19 Epidemic in China","We explored whether medical health workers had more psychosocial problems than nonmedical health workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. An online survey was run from February 19 to March 6, 2020; a total of 2,182 Chinese subjects participated. Mental health variables were assessed via the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Symptom Check List-revised (SCL-90-R), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), which included a 2-item anxiety scale and a 2-item depression scale (PHQ-2). Compared with nonmedical health workers (n = 1,255), medical health workers (n = 927) had a higher prevalence of insomnia (38.4 vs. 30.5%, p &lt; 0.01), anxiety (13.0 vs. 8.5%, p &lt; 0.01), depression (12.2 vs. 9.5%; p&lt; 0.04), somatization (1.6 vs. 0.4%; p &lt; 0.01), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (5.3 vs. 2.2%; p &lt; 0.01). They also had higher total scores of ISI, GAD-2, PHQ-2, and SCL-90-R obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p â‰¤ 0.01). Among medical health workers, having organic disease was an independent factor for insomnia, anxiety, depression, somatization, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &lt; 0.05 or 0.01). Living in rural areas, being female, and being at risk of contact with COVID-19 patients were the most common risk factors for insomnia, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and depression (p &lt; 0.01 or 0.05). Among nonmedical health workers, having organic disease was a risk factor for insomnia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (p &lt; 0.01 or 0.05). During the COVID-19 outbreak, medical health workers had psychosocial problems and risk factors for developing them.

"Traumatic stress in the age of COVID-19: A call to close critical gaps and adapt to new realities","Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) is transforming every aspect of our lives. Identified in late 2019, COVID-19 quickly became characterized as a <i>global pandemic</i> by March of 2020. Given the rapid acceleration of transmission, and the lack of preparedness to prevent and treat this virus, the negative impacts of COVID-19 are rippling through every facet of society. Although large numbers of people throughout the world will show resilience to the profound loss, stress, and fear associated with COVID-19, the virus will likely exacerbate existing mental health disorders and contribute to the onset of new stress-related disorders for many. The field of traumatic stress should address the serious needs that will emerge now and well into the future. However, we propose that these efforts may be limited, in part, by ongoing gaps that exist within our research and clinical care. In particular, we suggest that COVID-19 requires us to prioritize and mobilize as a research and clinical community around several key areas: (a) diagnostics, (b) prevention, (c) public outreach and communication, (d) working with medical staff and mainstreaming into nonmental health services, and (e) COVID-19-specific trauma research. As members of our community begin to rapidly develop and test interventions for COVID-19-related distress, we hope that those in positions of leadership in the field of traumatic stress consider limits of our current approaches, and invest the intellectual and financial resources urgently needed in order to innovate, forge partnerships, and develop the technologies to support those in greatest need.

"Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist","The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook. Historical parallels demonstrate that perseverance is as inevitable as pandemics and that we need not navigate this unprecedented time alone.","Bansal, Bingemann, Greenhawt, Mosnaim, Nanda, Oppenheimer, Sharma, Stukus, Shaker","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.001","20200611","Burnout; COVID-19; Depression; Grief; Mindfulness; Pandemic; Physician wellness; SARS-CoV-2; Social distancing; Wellness; Adaptation, Psychological; Allergy and Immunology; Ambulatory Care; Anxiety; Burnout, Professional; Communication; Coronavirus Infections; Delivery of Health Care; Depression; Efficiency; Grief; Guilt; Health Care Rationing; Health Promotion; Health Status; Humans; Mental Health; Mindfulness; Pandemics; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Professionalism; Social Behavior; Social Media; Spirituality; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicide","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Work stress among Chinese nurses to support Wuhan in fighting against COVID-19 epidemic","To investigate the work stress among Chinese nurses who are supporting Wuhan in fighting against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and to explore the relevant influencing factors. The COVID-19 epidemic has posed a major threat to public health. Nurses have always played an important role in infection prevention, infection control, isolation, containment and public health. However, available data on the work stress among these nurses are limited. A cross-sectional survey. An online questionnaire was completed by 180 anti-epidemic nurses from Guangxi. Data collection tools, including the Chinese version of the Stress Overload Scale (SOS) and the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), were used. Descriptive single factor correlation and multiple regression analyses were used in exploring the related influencing factors. The SOS (39.91Â Â±Â 12.92) and SAS (32.19Â Â±Â 7.56) scores of this nurse group were positively correlated (rÂ =Â 0.676, pÂ &lt;Â .05). Multiple regression analysis showed that only children, working hours per week and anxiety were the main factors affecting nurse stress (pÂ =Â .000, .048, .000, respectively). Nurses who fight against COVID-19 were generally under pressure. Nurse leaders should pay attention to the work stress and the influencing factors of the nurses who are fighting against COVID-19 infection, and offer solutions to retain mental health among these nurses.","Mo, Deng, Zhang, Lang, Liao, Wang, Qin, Huang","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13014","20200714","COVID-2019 epidemic; Chinese nurses; Wuhan; a cross-sectional survey; work stress; Adult; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nursing Staff; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk Factors; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

There are key challenges for psychiatry that require urgent attention to ensure mental health well-being for all - COVID-19-positive patients, healthcare professionals, first responders, people with psychiatric disorders and the general population. This editorial outlines some of these challenges and research questions, and serves as a preliminary framework of what needs to be addressed. Mental healthcare should be an integral component of healthcare policy and practice towards COVID-19. Collaborative efforts from psychiatric organisations and their members are required to maximise appropriate clinical and educational interventions while minimising stigma.","Kaufman, Petkova, Bhui, Schulze","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2020.25","20200514","COVID-19; education; healthcare policy; infectious outbreaks; medical disaster; mental health; psychiatric guidelines; psychiatric organisations; stigma; vulnerable populations","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Dealing with sleep problems during home confinement due to the COVID-19 outbreak: Practical recommendations from a task force of the European CBT-I Academy","In the current global home confinement situation due to the COVID-19 outbreak, most individuals are exposed to an unprecedented stressful situation of unknown duration. This may not only increase daytime stress, anxiety and depression levels, but also disrupt sleep. Importantly, because of the fundamental role that sleep plays in emotion regulation, sleep disturbance can have direct consequences upon next day emotional functioning. In this paper, we summarize what is known about the stress-sleep link and confinement as well as effective insomnia treatment. We discuss those effects of the current home confinement situation that can disrupt sleep but also those that could benefit sleep quality. We suggest adaptions of cognitive behavioural therapy elements that are feasible to implement for those facing changed work schedules and requirements, those with health anxiety and those handling childcare and home-schooling, whilst also recognizing the general limitations imposed on physical exercise and social interaction. Managing sleep problems as best as possible during home confinement can limit stress and possibly prevent disruptions of social relationships.","Altena, Baglioni, Espie, Ellis, Gavriloff, Holzinger, Schlarb, Frase, JernelÃ¶v, Riemann","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13052","20200504","COVID-19; home confinement; sleep problems; stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health and Quality of Life among Local Residents in Liaoning Province, China: A Cross-Sectional Study","Our study aimed to investigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and quality of life among local Chinese residents aged â‰¥18 years in Liaoning Province, mainland China. An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes. A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study. The mean age of the participants was 37.7 Â± 14.0 years, and 74.9% had a high level of education. The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 Â± 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact. Only 7.6% of participants had an IES score â‰¥26. The majority of participants (53.3%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic. On the other hand, 52.1% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8-77.9%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild stressful impact in our sample, even though the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. These findings would need to be verified in larger population studies.","Zhang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17072381","20200413","China; IES; coronavirus; mental health; pandemic; Adult; Anxiety; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Family; Family Health; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Quality of Life; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"People with Suspected COVID-19 Symptoms Were More Likely Depressed and Had Lower Health-Related Quality of Life: The Potential Benefit of Health Literacy","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic affects people's health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), especially in those who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms (S-COVID-19-S). We examined the effect of modifications of health literacy (HL) on depression and HRQoL. A cross-sectional study was conducted from 14 February to 2 March 2020. 3947 participants were recruited from outpatient departments of nine hospitals and health centers across Vietnam. The interviews were conducted using printed questionnaires including participants' characteristics, clinical parameters, health behaviors, HL, depression, and HRQoL. People with S-COVID-19-S had a higher depression likelihood (OR, 2.88; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), lower HRQoL-score (B, -7.92; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). In comparison to people without S-COVID-19-S and low HL, those with S-COVID-19-S and low HL had 9.70 times higher depression likelihood (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), 20.62 lower HRQoL-score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), for the people without S-COVID-19-S, 1 score increment of HL resulted in 5% lower depression likelihood (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and 0.45 higher HRQoL-score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), while for those people with S-COVID-19-S, 1 score increment of HL resulted in a 4% lower depression likelihood (<i>p</i> = 0.004) and 0.43 higher HRQoL-score (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Narrative synthesis of psychological and coping responses towards emerging infectious disease outbreaks in the general population: practical considerations for the COVID-19 pandemic","Emerging infectious disease outbreaks, such as the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often have a psychological impact on the well-being of the general population, including survivors and caregivers. Our study aimed to synthesise extant literature regarding the combined psychological responses and coping methods used by the general population in past outbreaks. We conducted a narrative synthesis of the published literature over the last two decades with a quality appraisal of included articles that reported both psychological responses and coping strategies within infectious disease outbreaks. A total of 144 papers were identified from the search, 24 of which were included in the review. Overall, 18 studies examined the psychosocial responses of the general population towards the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic, four studies focused on the Ebola epidemic and two studies covered the H1N1 outbreak. Common themes in psychological responses included anxiety/fears, depression, anger, guilt, grief and loss, post-traumatic stress, and stigmatisation, but also a greater sense of empowerment and compassion towards others. Coping strategies adopted included problem-focused coping (seeking alternatives, self- and other-preservation), seeking social support, avoidance, and positive appraisal of the situation. Amid the range of psychosocial responses seen in past infectious disease outbreaks, practical considerations for the current COVID-19 pandemic need to focus on the individual in the context of the larger social environment, with an emphasis on raising awareness of the range of possible psychosocial responses, access to psychological help, self- care, empowering self-support groups and sustained engagement with updated, reliable information about the outbreak.","Chew, Wei, Vasoo, Chua, Sim","https://doi.org/10.11622/smedj.2020046","20200402","coping; COVID-19; infectious disease outbreak; psychosocial responses","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence and predictors of PTSS during COVID-19 outbreak in China hardest-hit areas: Gender differences matter","The outbreak of COVID-19 in China in December 2019 has been identified as a pandemic and a health emergency of global concern. Our objective was to investigate the prevalence and predictors of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in China hardest-hit areas during COVID-19 outbreak, especially exploring the gender difference existing in PTSS. One month after the December 2019 COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China, we surveyed PTSS and sleep qualities among 285 residents in Wuhan and surrounding cities using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and 4 items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Hierarchical regression analysis and non-parametric test were used to analyze the data. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS in China hardest-hit areas a month after the COVID-19 outbreak was 7%. Women reported significant higher PTSS in the domains of re-experiencing, negative alterations in cognition or mood, and hyper-arousal. Participants with better sleep quality or less frequency of early awakenings reported lower PTSS. Professional and effective mental health services should be designed in order to aid the psychological wellbeing of the population in affected areas, especially those living in hardest-hit areas, females and people with poor sleep quality.","Liu, Zhang, Wei, Jia, Shang, Sun, Wu, Sun, Zhou, Wang, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112921","20200423","Adult; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Prevalence; Sex Factors; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study","The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.","Kang, Ma, Chen, Yang, Wang, Li, Yao, Bai, Cai, Xiang Yang, Hu, Zhang, Wang, Ma, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028","20200702","2019 novel coronavirus disease; Exposure; Medical and nursing staff; Mental health; Mental healthcare; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Mental Health Services; Middle Aged; Nurses; Pandemics; Patient Health Questionnaire; Physicians; Pneumonia, Viral; Psychological Distress; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Despite all resources employed to counteract the spreading of the virus, additional global strategies are needed to handle the related mental health issues. Published articles concerning mental health related to the COVID-19 outbreak and other previous global infections have been considered and reviewed. This outbreak is leading to additional health problems such as stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia, denial, anger and fear globally.

"The psychological impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on college students in China","A COVID-19 epidemic has been spreading in China and other parts of the world since December 2019. The epidemic has brought not only the risk of death from infection but also unbearable psychological pressure. We sampled college students from Changzhi medical college by using cluster sampling. They responded to a questionnaire packet that included the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and those inquiring the participants' basic information. We received 7,143 responses. Results indicated that 0.9% of the respondents were experiencing severe anxiety, 2.7% moderate anxiety, and 21.3% mild anxiety. Moreover, living in urban areas (ORÂ =Â 0.810, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.709 - 0.925), family income stability (ORÂ =Â 0.726, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.645Â -Â 0.817) and living with parents (ORÂ =Â 0.752, 95% CIÂ =Â 0.596Â -Â 0.950) were protective factors against anxiety. Moreover, having relatives or acquaintances infected with COVID-19 was a risk factor for increasing the anxiety of college students (ORÂ =Â 3.007, 95% CIÂ =Â 2.377Â -Â 3.804). Results of correlation analysis indicated that economic effects, and effects on daily life, as well as delays in academic activities, were positively associated with anxiety symptoms (PÂ &lt;Â .001). However, social support was negatively correlated with the level of anxiety (PÂ &lt;Â .001).

"COVID-19 disease emergency operational instructions for Mental Health Departments issued by the Italian Society of Epidemiological Psychiatry","During the current COVID-19 disease emergency, it is not only an ethical imperative but also a public health responsibility to keep the network of community psychiatry services operational, particularly for the most vulnerable subjects (those with mental illness, disability, and chronic conditions). At the same time, it is necessary to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 disease within the outpatient and inpatient services affiliated with Mental Health Departments. These instructions, first published online on 16 March 2020 in their original Italian version, provide a detailed description of actions, proposed by the Italian Society of Epidemiological Psychiatry, addressed to Italian Mental Health Departments during the current COVID-19 pandemic. The overall goal of the operational instructions is to guarantee, during the current health emergency, the provision of the best health care possible, taking into account both public health necessities and the safety of procedures. These instructions could represent a useful resource to mental health providers, and stakeholders to face the current pandemic for which most of Mental Health Departments worldwide are not prepared to. These instructions could provide guidance and offer practical tools which can enable professionals and decision makers to foresee challenges, like those already experienced in Italy, which in part can be avoided or minimised if timely planned. These strategies can be shared and adopted, with the appropriate adjustments, by Mental Health Departments in other countries.","Starace, Ferrara","https://doi.org/10.1017/S2045796020000372","20200421","Community mental health; emergency psychiatry; health service research; mental health; quality of care; Ambulatory Care; Betacoronavirus; Community Mental Health Services; Coronavirus Infections; Emergency Service, Hospital; Health Services Research; Humans; Italy; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Psychiatry; Public Health; Quality of Health Care; Societies, Medical","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"TheÂ Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Development and Initial Validation","The emergence of the COVID-19 and its consequences has led to fears, worries, and anxiety among individuals worldwide. The present study developed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) to complement the clinical efforts in preventing the spread and treating of COVID-19 cases. The sample comprised 717 Iranian participants. The items of the FCV-19S were constructed based on extensive review of existing scales on fears, expert evaluations, and participant interviews. Several psychometric tests were conducted to ascertain its reliability and validity properties. After panel review and corrected item-total correlation testing, seven items with acceptable corrected item-total correlation (0.47 to 0.56) were retained and further confirmed by significant and strong factor loadings (0.66 to 0.74). Also, other properties evaluated using both classical test theory and Rasch model were satisfactory on the seven-item scale. More specifically, reliability values such as internal consistency (<i>Î±</i> = .82) and test-retest reliability (ICC = .72) were acceptable. Concurrent validity was supported by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (with depression, <i>r</i> = 0.425 and anxiety, <i>r</i> = 0.511) and the Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (with perceived infectability, <i>r</i> = 0.483 and germ aversion, r = 0.459). The Fear of COVID-19 Scale, a seven-item scale, has robust psychometric properties. It is reliable and valid in assessing fear of COVID-19 among the general population and will also be useful in allaying COVID-19 fears among individuals.","Ahorsu, Lin, Imani, Saffari, Griffiths, Pakpour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8","20200402","COVID-19; Fear; Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Iran; Psychometrics","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We aimed to delineate and compare the immunological features of severe and moderate COVID-19.METHODSIn this retrospective study, the clinical and immunological characteristics of 21 patients (17 male and 4 female) with COVID-19 were analyzed. These patients were classified as severe (11 cases) and moderate (10 cases) according to the guidelines released by the National Health Commission of China.RESULTSThe median age of severe and moderate cases was 61.0 and 52.0 years, respectively. Common clinical manifestations included fever, cough, and fatigue. Compared with moderate cases, severe cases more frequently had dyspnea, lymphopenia, and hypoalbuminemia, with higher levels of alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, ferritin, and D-dimer as well as markedly higher levels of IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-Î±. Absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells decreased in nearly all the patients, and were markedly lower in severe cases (294.0, 177.5, and 89.0 Ã— 106/L, respectively) than moderate cases (640.5, 381.5, and 254.0 Ã— 106/L, respectively). The expression of IFN-Î³ by CD4+ T cells tended to be lower in severe cases (14.1%) than in moderate cases (22.8%).CONCLUSIONThe SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect primarily T lymphocytes, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, resulting in a decrease in numbers as well as IFN-Î³ production by CD4+ T cells. These potential immunological markers may be of importance because of their correlation with disease severity in COVID-19.TRIAL REGISTRATIONThis is a retrospective observational study without a trial registration number.FUNDINGThis work is funded by grants from Tongji Hospital for the Pilot Scheme Project, and partly supported by the Chinese National Thirteenth Five Years Project in Science and Technology for Infectious Disease (2017ZX10202201).","Chen, Wu, Guo, Cao, Huang, Wang, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Yu, Zhang, Zhang, Wu, Song, Chen, Han, Li, Luo, Zhao, Ning","https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI137244","20200506","COVID-19; Cytokines; Immunology; Infectious disease; Respiration; T cells; Adult; Aged; Cell Count; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cytokines; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; T-Lymphocytes","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Digital Mental Health and COVID-19: Using Technology Today to Accelerate the Curve on Access and Quality Tomorrow","As interest in and use of telehealth during the COVID-19 global pandemic increase, the potential of digital health to increase access and quality of mental health is becoming clear. Although the world today must &quot;flatten the curve&quot; of spread of the virus, we argue that now is the time to &quot;accelerate and bend the curve&quot; on digital health. Increased investments in digital health today will yield unprecedented access to high-quality mental health care. Focusing on personal experiences and projects from our diverse authorship team, we share selected examples of digital health innovations while acknowledging that no single piece can discuss all the impressive global efforts past and present. Exploring the success of telehealth during the present crisis and how technologies like apps can soon play a larger role, we discuss the need for workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity among other factors critical for bending the curve further.","Torous, JÃ¤n Myrick, Rauseo-Ricupero, Firth","https://doi.org/10.2196/18848","20200430","apps; digital health; emergency response; telehealth","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The Impact of COVID-19 Epidemic Declaration on Psychological Consequences: A Study on Active Weibo Users","COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) has significantly resulted in a large number of psychological consequences. The aim of this study is to explore the impacts of COVID-19 on people's mental health, to assist policy makers to develop actionable policies, and help clinical practitioners (e.g., social workers, psychiatrists, and psychologists) provide timely services to affected populations. We sample and analyze the Weibo posts from 17,865 active Weibo users using the approach of Online Ecological Recognition (OER) based on several machine-learning predictive models. We calculated word frequency, scores of emotional indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, indignation, and Oxford happiness) and cognitive indicators (e.g., social risk judgment and life satisfaction) from the collected data. The sentiment analysis and the paired sample t-test were performed to examine the differences in the same group before and after the declaration of COVID-19 on 20 January, 2020. The results showed that negative emotions (e.g., anxiety, depression and indignation) and sensitivity to social risks increased, while the scores of positive emotions (e.g., Oxford happiness) and life satisfaction decreased. People were concerned more about their health and family, while less about leisure and friends. The results contribute to the knowledge gaps of short-term individual changes in psychological conditions after the outbreak. It may provide references for policy makers to plan and fight against COVID-19 effectively by improving stability of popular feelings and urgently prepare clinical practitioners to deliver corresponding therapy foundations for the risk groups and affected people.","Li, Wang, Xue, Zhao, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17062032","20200401","cognition; emotion; mental health; public health emergencies; word frequency analysis; Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Emotions; Epidemics; Female; Happiness; Humans; Internet; Male; Mental Health; Pandemics; Personal Satisfaction; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; Risk Factors; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Factors Associated With Mental Health Outcomes Among Health Care Workers Exposed to Coronavirus Disease 2019","Health care workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) could be psychologically stressed. To assess the magnitude of mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers treating patients exposed to COVID-19 in China. This cross-sectional, survey-based, region-stratified study collected demographic data and mental health measurements from 1257 health care workers in 34 hospitals from January 29, 2020, to February 3, 2020, in China. Health care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 were eligible. The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress was assessed by the Chinese versions of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index, and the 22-item Impact of Event Scale-Revised, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mental health outcomes. A total of 1257 of 1830 contacted individuals completed the survey, with a participation rate of 68.7%. A total of 813 (64.7%) were aged 26 to 40 years, and 964 (76.7%) were women. Of all participants, 764 (60.8%) were nurses, and 493 (39.2%) were physicians; 760 (60.5%) worked in hospitals in Wuhan, and 522 (41.5%) were frontline health care workers. A considerable proportion of participants reported symptoms of depression (634 [50.4%]), anxiety (560 [44.6%]), insomnia (427 [34.0%]), and distress (899 [71.5%]). Nurses, women, frontline health care workers, and those working in Wuhan, China, reported more severe degrees of all measurements of mental health symptoms than other health care workers (eg, median [IQR] Patient Health Questionnaire scores among physicians vs nurses: 4.0 [1.0-7.0] vs 5.0 [2.0-8.0]; Pâ€‰=â€‰.007; median [interquartile range {IQR}] Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale scores among men vs women: 2.0 [0-6.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-7.0]; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001; median [IQR] Insomnia Severity Index scores among frontline vs second-line workers: 6.0 [2.0-11.0] vs 4.0 [1.0-8.0]; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001; median [IQR] Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores among those in Wuhan vs those in Hubei outside Wuhan and those outside Hubei: 21.0 [8.5-34.5] vs 18.0 [6.0-28.0] in Hubei outside Wuhan and 15.0 [4.0-26.0] outside Hubei; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed participants from outside Hubei province were associated with lower risk of experiencing symptoms of distress compared with those in Wuhan (odds ratio [OR], 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-0.88; Pâ€‰=â€‰.008). Frontline health care workers engaged in direct diagnosis, treatment, and care of patients with COVID-19 were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of depression (OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; Pâ€‰=â€‰.01), anxiety (OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.22-2.02; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), insomnia (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.92-4.60; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), and distress (OR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.25-2.04; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001). In this survey of heath care workers in hospitals equipped with fever clinics or wards for patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and other regions in China, participants reported experiencing psychological burden, especially nurses, women, those in Wuhan, and frontline health care workers directly engaged in the diagnosis, treatment, and care for patients with COVID-19.","Lai, Ma, Wang, Cai, Hu, Wei, Wu, Du, Chen, Li, Tan, Kang, Yao, Huang, Wang, Wang, Liu, Hu","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.3976","20200401","Adult; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Response of Chinese Anesthesiologists to the COVID-19 Outbreak","The coronavirus disease 2019, named COVID-19 officially by the World Health Organization (Geneva, Switzerland) on February 12, 2020, has spread at unprecedented speed. After the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, Chinese anesthesiologists encountered increasing numbers of infected patients since December 2019. Because the main route of transmission is via respiratory droplets and close contact, anesthesia providers are at a high risk when responding to the devastating mass emergency. So far, actions have been taken including but not limited to nationwide actions and online education regarding special procedures of airway management, oxygen therapy, ventilation support, hemodynamic management, sedation, and analgesia. As the epidemic situation has lasted for months (thus far), special platforms have also been set up to provide free mental health care to all anesthesia providers participating in acute and critical caring for COVID-19 patients.

"Immediate Psychological Responses and Associated Factors during the Initial Stage of the 2019 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Epidemic among the General Population in China","<i>Background:</i> The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a challenge to psychological resilience. Research data are needed to develop evidence-driven strategies to reduce adverse psychological impacts and psychiatric symptoms during the epidemic. The aim of this study was to survey the general public in China to better understand their levels of psychological impact, anxiety, depression, and stress during the initial stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The data will be used for future reference. <i>Methods:</i> From 31 January to 2 February 2020, we conducted an online survey using snowball sampling techniques. The online survey collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days, contact history with COVID-19, knowledge and concerns about COVID-19, precautionary measures against COVID-19, and additional information required with respect to COVID-19. Psychological impact was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). <i>Results:</i> This study included 1210 respondents from 194 cities in China. In total, 53.8% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate or severe; 16.5% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms; and 8.1% reported moderate to severe stress levels. Most respondents spent 20-24 h per day at home (84.7%); were worried about their family members contracting COVID-19 (75.2%); and were satisfied with the amount of health information available (75.1%). Female gender, student status, specific physical symptoms (e.g., myalgia, dizziness, coryza), and poor self-rated health status were significantly associated with a greater psychological impact of the outbreak and higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Specific up-to-date and accurate health information (e.g., treatment, local outbreak situation) and particular precautionary measures (e.g., hand hygiene, wearing a mask) were associated with a lower psychological impact of the outbreak and lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <i>Conclusions:</i> During the initial phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, more than half of the respondents rated the psychological impact as moderate-to-severe, and about one-third reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Our findings identify factors associated with a lower level of psychological impact and better mental health status that can be used to formulate psychological interventions to improve the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Wang, Pan, Wan, Tan, Xu, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17051729","20200318","anxiety; coronavirus; depression; epidemic; knowledge; precaution; psychological impact; respiratory symptoms; stress; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Betacoronavirus; Child; China; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Disease Outbreaks; Epidemics; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Viral; Resilience, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of lung cancer patients during the outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)]","With the increasing number of cases and widening geographical spread, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been classified as one of the class B infectious diseases but prevented and controlled as class A infectious disease by the National Health Commission of China. The diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients have been challenged greatly because of extraordinary public health measures since the lung cancer patients are a high-risk population during the COVID-19 outbreak period. Strict protection for lung cancer patients is needed to avoid infection. Lung cancer patients are difficult to differentiate from patients with COVID-19 in terms of clinical symptoms, which will bring great trouble to the clinical work and physical and mental health of lung cancer patients. This review will demonstrate how to applicate appropriate and individual management for lung cancer patients to protect them from COVID-19. éšç€æ–°åž‹å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’è‚ºç‚Ž(ç®€ç§°æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Ž)ç—…ä¾‹æŠ¥å‘Šçš„å¢žåŠ ï¼Œå›½å®¶å«ç”Ÿå¥åº·å§”å‘˜ä¼šå°†æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žçº³å…¥ä¹™ç±»ä¼ æŸ“ç—…ï¼ŒæŒ‰ç…§ç”²ç±»ä¼ æŸ“ç—…è¿›è¡Œç®¡ç†ã€‚åœ¨å…¨å›½å„åœ°æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žé˜²æŽ§å·¥ä½œå¼€å±•çš„åŒæ—¶ï¼Œè‚ºç™Œæ‚£è€…çš„è¯Šç–—å·¥ä½œåœ¨æ–°çš„ç–«æƒ…ä¸‹å—åˆ°äº†æžå¤§çš„æŒ‘æˆ˜ã€‚è‚ºç™Œæ‚£è€…åœ¨æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žç–«æƒ…ä¸‹å±žäºŽé«˜å±äººç¾¤ï¼Œéœ€è¦ä¸¥å¯†é˜²æŠ¤ï¼Œé¿å…æ„ŸæŸ“ã€‚æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žæ‚£è€…ä¸Žè‚ºç™Œæ‚£è€…åœ¨ä¸´åºŠç—‡çŠ¶ä¹‹é—´æ˜“äºŽæ··æ·†ï¼Œè¿™å°†ç»™è‚ºç™Œæ‚£è€…çš„é‰´åˆ«è¯Šæ–­ä»¥åŠèº«å¿ƒå¥åº·å¸¦æ¥æžå¤§çš„å›°æ‰°ã€‚æ–‡ç« å°†ä»Žä¸åŒå±‚é¢é˜è¿°æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žç–«æƒ…ä¸‹åŒ»æ‚£å¦‚ä½•æºæ‰‹ï¼Œå…±åŒé¢å¯¹è‚ºç™Œæ‚£è€…çš„ç²¾ç»†åŒ–å’Œä¸ªä½“åŒ–ç®¡ç†ï¼ŒæœŸæœ›è¿™äº›å»ºè®®èƒ½å¸®åŠ©è‚ºç™Œæ‚£è€…å¹³ç¨³åº¦è¿‡æ–°å† è‚ºç‚Žçš„ç‰¹æ®Šæ—¶æœŸã€‚.","Yang, Xu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112152-20200229-00152","20200513","COVID-19; Diagnostic and therapeutic strategy; Lung neoplasms; Betacoronavirus; China; Communicable Disease Control; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Pandemics; Patient Care Planning; Pneumonia, Viral; Risk","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"[Psychological intervention for patients with oral disease during the pandemic period of COVID-19]","Public health emergencies have an impact on the public mental health. The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has affected the normal diagnosis and treatment services in stomatological institutions across the country. Delay of non-emergency dental service will have a potential impact on the experience, cognition, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with oral diseases. Through literature retrieving, this article reviewed the oral psychosomatic diseases closely related to a patient's psychological status, such as oral mucosal disease, temporomandibular joint disease, bruxism, periodontal disease and so on. It was believed that the patients with these disorders might be more susceptible to the impact of stress events, and need be paid more attention by dental specialists. At the same time, this article analyzes the possible psychological stress symptoms of patients with various oral diseases, and puts forward suggestions for remote consultation and emergency treatment of dentists. From the perspective of social role, dentist plays not only the role of expert for professional guidance in dentistry, but also the role of helper in psychological counseling for patients. çªå‘å…¬å…±å«ç”Ÿäº‹ä»¶å¯å¯¹å…¬ä¼—å¿ƒç†äº§ç”Ÿå½±å“ã€‚æ–°åž‹å† çŠ¶ç—…æ¯’ç–«æƒ…æš´å‘å½±å“äº†å…¨å›½å£è…”åŒ»ç–—æœºæž„æ­£å¸¸å¼€å±•è¯Šç–—æœåŠ¡ï¼Œå£è…”é—¨è¯Šå»¶æœŸç­‰åº”å¯¹æŽªæ–½å¯å¯¹å£è…”ç–¾ç—…æ‚£è€…çš„ä½“éªŒã€è®¤çŸ¥ã€æ²»ç–—å’Œåº·å¤ç­‰æ–¹é¢äº§ç”Ÿæ½œåœ¨å½±å“ã€‚æœ¬æ–‡é€šè¿‡æ–‡çŒ®å¤ä¹ ï¼Œå¯¹å£è…”é»è†œç—…ã€é¢žä¸‹é¢Œå…³èŠ‚ç—…ã€ç£¨ç‰™ç—‡ã€ç‰™å‘¨ç—…ç­‰ä¸Žæ‚£è€…å¿ƒç†çŠ¶æ€å¯†åˆ‡ç›¸å…³çš„å£è…”å¿ƒèº«ç–¾ç—…è¿›è¡Œå›žé¡¾ï¼Œè®¤ä¸ºè¿™äº›æ‚£è€…å¯èƒ½æ›´å®¹æ˜“å—åˆ°åº”æ¿€äº‹ä»¶çš„å½±å“ï¼Œéœ€è¦å£è…”ä¸“ç§‘åŒ»å¸ˆæé«˜å…³æ³¨åº¦ã€‚åŒæ—¶åˆ†æžäº†ä¸åŒå£è…”ç–¾ç—…æ‚£è€…å¯èƒ½å‡ºçŽ°çš„å¿ƒç†åº”æ¿€ç—‡çŠ¶ï¼Œä¸ºå£è…”åŒ»å¸ˆè¿œç¨‹å’¨è¯¢å’Œæ€¥è¯ŠæŽ¥è¯Šæå‡ºå»ºè®®ã€‚ç–«æƒ…æœŸé—´å£è…”åŒ»å¸ˆä¸ä»…æ‰¿æ‹…äº†å£è…”ä¸“ä¸šæŒ‡å¯¼çš„ä¸“å®¶è§’è‰²ï¼Œè¿˜æ‰¿æ‹…äº†å¸®åŠ©æ‚£è€…è¿›è¡Œå¿ƒç†ç–å¯¼çš„è§’è‰²ã€‚.","Qu, Zhou","https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112144-20200213-00053","20200513","COVID-19; Crisis intervention; Oral psychosomatic disorder; Stress, psychological; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Mouth Diseases; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Stress, Psychological","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Predictors of response to augmentation treatment in patients with treatment-resistant depression: A systematic review","Treatment-resistant depression is an important contributor to the global burden of depression. Antidepressant augmentation is a recommended treatment strategy for treatment-resistant patients, but outcomes remain poor. Identifying factors that are predictive of response to augmentation treatments may improve outcomes. This review aimed to synthesise the existing literature examining predictors of response to augmentation treatments in patients who had insufficiently responded to initial treatment. A systematic search was conducted identifying 2241 unique manuscripts. 24 examining predictors of outcome to pharmacological or psychological augmentation treatment were included in this review. Atypical antipsychotics were the most frequently assessed treatment class (nine studies), closely followed by mood stabilisers (eight studies). Only one eligible psychological augmentation study was identified. Early response to treatment (week 2) was the best-supported predictor of subsequent treatment outcome, reported by six studies. Many predictor variables were only assessed by one report and others such as pre-treatment severity yielded contradictory results, both within and across treatment classes. This review highlights the importance of early response as a predictor of pharmacological augmentation outcome, with implications for both the monitoring and treatment of resistant unipolar patients. Further replication is needed across specific interventions to fully assess the generalisability of this finding. However, the clear lack of consistent evidence for other predictive factors both within and across treatments, and the scarce examination of psychological augmentation, demonstrates the need for much more research of a high quality if response prediction is to improve outcomes for patients with treatment-resistant depression.","Taylor, Marwood, Greer, Strawbridge, Cleare","https://doi.org/10.1177/0269881119872194","20200723","Depression; drug augmentation; prognostic factors; review; Antidepressive Agents; Antimanic Agents; Antipsychotic Agents; Coronavirus Infections; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Fronto-Limbic Connectivity as a Predictor of Improvement in Nonsuicidal Self-Injury in Adolescents Following Psychotherapy","<b> <i>Objectives:</i> </b> Key neurobiological factors contribute to vulnerability to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents and how they respond to treatment targeted to reduce such behaviors. This study aims to examine differences in intrinsic functional connectivity between adolescents with NSSI and healthy controls (HCs) and to identify baseline connectivity markers that predict improvements in NSSI after psychotherapy. <b> <i>Methods:</i> </b> Adolescents aged 12-17 (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰24) with repetitive NSSI along with demographically similar HCs (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰16) underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning after which patients received up to 4 months of psychological treatment. A seed-based approach was used to examine baseline between-group differences in intrinsic functional connectivity of the amygdala and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Further analyses examined the associations between intrinsic functional connectivity at baseline and improvement in NSSI after psychological treatment. <b> <i>Results:</i> </b> Compared with HCs, adolescents with NSSI showed significantly reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex, subcallosal cortex, and paracingulate gyrus, as well as between the amygdala and a cluster encompassing the right planum temporale and right insula. Adolescents with NSSI, compared with HCs, also showed reduced connectivity between the mPFC and two clusters: one located in the precentral and postcentral gyri and another in the left insula. After treatment, 50% of patients reported fewer NSSI episodes compared to baseline, which was considered as improvement. Stronger negative amygdala-prefrontal connectivity was associated with greater posttreatment improvement in NSSI. <b> <i>Conclusions:</i> </b> Adolescents with NSSI may have aberrant amygdala and mPFC connectivity compared with HCs. Furthermore, stronger baseline negative amygdala-prefrontal connectivity may predict greater improvement in NSSI after psychological intervention. Given that no prior study has used resting-state functional connectivity to predict response to psychological treatment in adolescents with NSSI, replication of these findings is needed.","Santamarina-Perez, Romero, Mendez, Leslie, Packer, Sugranyes, Picado, Font, Moreno, Martinez, Morer, Romero, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1089/cap.2018.0152","20200716","NSSI; amygdala; brain connectivity; medial prefrontal cortex; psychological intervention; resting state; Adolescent; Brain; Child; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Frontal Lobe; Humans; Limbic System; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Psychotherapy; Self-Injurious Behavior","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The effects of past SARS experience and proximity on declines in numbers of travelers to the Republic of Korea during the 2015 MERS outbreak: A retrospective study","The experience of previous sizable outbreaks may affect travelers' decisions to travel to an area with an ongoing outbreak. We estimated changes in monthly numbers of visitors to the Republic of Korea (ROK) in 2015 compared to projected values by selected areas. We tested whether areas' experience of a previous SARS outbreak of â‰¥100 cases or distance to the ROK had a significant effect on travel to the ROK during the MERS outbreak using t-tests and regression models. The percentage changes in visitors from areas with a previous SARS outbreak of â‰¥100 cases decreased more than the percentage changes in visitors from their counterparts in June (52.4% vs. 23.3%) and July (60.0% vs. 31.4%) during the 2015 MERS outbreak. The percentage changes in visitors from the close and intermediate categories decreased more than the far category. The results from regression models and sensitivity analyses demonstrated that areas with â‰¥100 SARS cases and closer proximity to the ROK had significantly larger percentage decreases in traveler volumes during the outbreak. During the 2015 MERS outbreak, areas with a previous sizable SARS outbreak and areas near the ROK showed greater decreases in percentage changes in visitors to the ROK.","Joo, Henry, Lee, Berro, Maskery","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2019.05.009","20191024","Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Regression Analysis; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Travel","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Simultaneous detection and differentiation of canine parvovirus and feline parvovirus by high resolution melting analysis","Canine parvovirus (CPV) and feline parvovirus (FPV) are causative agents of diarrhea in dogs and cats, which manifests as depression, vomiting, fever, loss of appetite, leucopenia, and diarrhea in young animals. CPV and FPV can single or mixed infect cats and cause disease. To diagnose sick animals effectively, an effective virus diagnostic and genome typing method with high sensitivity and specificity is required. In this study, a conserved segment containing one SNP A4408C of parvovirus was used for real-time PCR amplification. Subsequently, data were auto-analyzed and plotted using Applied BiosystemsÂ® High Resolution Melt Software v3.1. Results showed that CPV and FPV can be detected simultaneously in a single PCR reaction. No cross-reactions were observed with canine adenovirus, canine coronavirus, and canine distemper virus. The assay had a detection limit of 4.2 genome copies of CPV and FPV. A total of 80 clinical samples were subjected to this assay, as well as to conventional PCR-sequence assay and virus isolation. Results showed that the percentage of agreement of the assay and other methods are high. In short, we have developed a diagnostic test for the accurate detection and differentiation of CPV and FPV in fecal samples, which is also cost effective.","Sun, Cheng, Lin, Zhang, Yi, Tong, Cao, Li, Cheng, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-019-1898-5","20190523","Canine parvovirus; Differentiation; Feline parvovirus; HRM; Simultaneous detection; Feline Panleukopenia Virus; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Nucleic Acid Denaturation; Parvoviridae Infections; Parvovirus, Canine; Transition Temperature","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Decline of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and its complex evolutionary relationship with porcine respiratory coronavirus in the United States","The epidemiology and genetic diversity of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in the United States (US) was investigated by testing clinical cases for TGEV by real time RT-PCR between January 2008 and November 2016. Prevalence of TGEV ranged between 3.8-6.8% andÂ peaked during cold months until March 2013, in which prevalence decreased toâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.1%. Nineteen complete TGEV genomes and a single strain of porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) from the US were generated and compared to historical strains to investigate the evolution of these endemic coronaviruses. Sixteen of our TGEV strains share 8 unique deletions and 119 distinct amino acid changes, which might greatly affect the biological characteristics of the variant TGEV, and resulted in a &quot;variant&quot; genotype of TGEV. The &quot;variant&quot; genotype shared similar unique deletions and amino acid changes with the recent PRCV strain identified in this study, suggesting a recombination event occurred between the ''variant'' TGEV and PRCV. Moreover, the results indicate the &quot;variant&quot; genotype is the dominant genotype circulating in the US. Therefore, this study provides insight into the occurrence, origin, genetic characteristics, and evolution of TGEV and PRCV circulating in the US.","Chen, Knutson, Rossow, Saif, Marthaler","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-40564-z","20200323",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological impact of the 2015 MERS outbreak on hospital workers and quarantined hemodialysis patients","This study aimed to assess the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis and university hospital workers who treated patients Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) during its outbreak. The group of subjects consisted of 1800 hospital practitioners and 73 quarantined patients undergoing hemodialysis. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) was administered to the practitioners twice, once during the hospital shutdown and again one month after the shutdown. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were administered to patients undergoing hemodialysis. During the initial stages of the MERS outbreak, healthcare workers who performed MERS-related tasks scored significantly higher on the total IES-R and its subscales. In the second assessment of the high-risk group, the sleep and numbness subscale scores from the IES-R differed depending on the implementation of home quarantine, and the intrusion subscale scores differed depending on the performance of MERS-related tasks. Medical staff that performed MERS-related tasks showed the highest risk for post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms even after time had elapsed. The risk increased even after home quarantine.

"Effect of selected gastrointestinal parasites and viral agents on fecal S100A12 concentrations in puppies as a potential comparative model","Previous data suggest that fecal S100A12 has clinical utility as a biomarker of chronic gastrointestinal inflammation (idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease) in both people and dogs, but the effect of gastrointestinal pathogens on fecal S100A12 concentrations is largely unknown. The role of S100A12 in parasite and viral infections is also difficult to study in traditional animal models due to the lack of S100A12 expression in rodents. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate fecal S100A12 concentrations in a cohort of puppies with intestinal parasites (Cystoisospora spp., Toxocara canis, Giardia sp.) and viral agents that are frequently encountered and known to cause gastrointestinal signs in dogs (coronavirus, parvovirus) as a comparative model. Spot fecal samples were collected from 307 puppies [median age (range): 7 (4-13) weeks; 29 different breeds] in French breeding kennels, and fecal scores (semiquantitative system; scores 1-13) were assigned. Fecal samples were tested for Cystoisospora spp. (C. canis and C. ohioensis), Toxocara canis, Giardia sp., as well as canine coronavirus (CCV) and parvovirus (CPV). S100A12 concentrations were measured in all fecal samples using an in-house radioimmunoassay. Statistical analyses were performed using non-parametric 2-group or multiple-group comparisons, non-parametric correlation analysis, association testing between nominal variables, and construction of a multivariate mixed model. Fecal S100A12 concentrations ranged from &lt; 24-14,363 ng/g. Univariate analysis only showed increased fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs shedding Cystoisospora spp. (P = 0.0384) and in dogs infected with parvovirus (P = 0.0277), whereas dogs infected with coronavirus had decreased fecal S100A12 concentrations (P = 0.0345). However, shedding of any single enteropathogen did not affect fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (all P &gt; 0.05) in this study. Only fecal score and breed size had an effect on fecal S100A12 concentrations in multivariate analysis (P &lt; 0.0001). An infection with any single enteropathogen tested in this study is unlikely to alter fecal S100A12 concentrations, and these preliminary data are important for further studies evaluating fecal S100A12 concentrations in dogs or when using fecal S100A12 concentrations as a biomarker in patients with chronic idiopathic gastrointestinal inflammation.","Heilmann, Grellet, GrÃ¼tzner, Cranford, Suchodolski, Chastant-Maillard, Steiner","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-018-2841-5","20180925","Biomarker; Calgranulin C; Canine; Diarrhea; Enteropathogen; Parasite; Virus; Animals; Biomarkers; Coronavirus; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Feces; Gastroenteritis; Giardia; Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic; Isospora; Parvovirus; S100A12 Protein; Toxocara; Virus Diseases","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychiatric Findings in Suspected and Confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Patients Quarantined in Hospital: A Retrospective Chart Analysis","Little is known about the psychiatric complications or risk factors for depression in suspected or confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) patients quarantined in hospital. A retrospective chart review was performed of all the patients admitted to the acute MERS inpatient unit at the NMC during the 2015 outbreak. 30 (75%) were confirmed to be MERS-CoV positive among 40 admitted cases. Among the 24 MERS survivors, 17 (70.8%) exhibited psychiatric symptoms and 10 (41.7%) received a psychiatric diagnosis and medication during their hospital stay. Suspected MERS patients did not exhibit psychiatric symptoms or receive a psychiatric diagnosis. 27 suspected or confirmed MERS patients (age 41.15Â±18.64, male 37.0%) completed psychological assessments. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-Short form and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised scores were significantly positively correlated with Patient Health Questionnaire-9 scores. Our findings indicate that the acute treatment of MERS-CoV infections in quarantine had a significant impact on the patients' mental health.

"Safety and tolerability of a novel, polyclonal human anti-MERS coronavirus antibody produced from transchromosomic cattle: a phase 1 randomised, double-blind, single-dose-escalation study","Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a severe respiratory illness with an overall mortality of 35%. There is no licensed or proven treatment. Passive immunotherapy approaches are being developed to prevent and treat several human medical conditions where alternative therapeutic options are absent. We report the safety of a fully human polyclonal IgG antibody (SAB-301) produced from the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle immunised with a MERS coronavirus vaccine. We did a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. We recruited healthy participants aged 18-60 years who had normal laboratory parameters at enrolment, a body-mass index of 19-32 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and a creatinine clearance of 70 mL/min or more, and who did not have any chronic medical problems that required daily oral medications, a positive rheumatoid factor (â‰¥15 IU/mL), IgA deficiency (&lt;7 mg/dL), or history of allergy to intravenous immunoglobulin or human blood products. Participants were randomly assigned by a computer-generated table, made by a masked pharmacist, to one of six cohorts (containing between three and ten participants each). Cohorts 1 and 2 had three participants, randomly assigned 2:1 to receive active drug SAB-301 versus normal saline placebo; cohorts 3 and 4 had six participants randomised 2:1; and cohorts 5 and 6 had ten participants, randomised 4:1. Participants received 1 mg/kg, 2Â·5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, or 50 mg/kg of SAB-301, or equivalent volume placebo (saline control), on day 0, and were followed up by clinical, laboratory, and pharmacokinetic assessments on days 1, 3, 7, 21, 42, and 90. The primary outcome was safety, and immunogenicity was a secondary outcome. We analysed the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02788188. Between June 2, 2016, and Jan 4, 2017, we screened 43 participants, of whom 38 were eligible and randomly assigned to receive SAB-301 (n=28) or placebo (n=10). 97 adverse events were reported: 64 adverse events occurred in 23 (82%) of 28 participants receiving SAB-301 (mean 2Â·3 adverse events per participant). 33 adverse events occurred in all ten participants receiving placebo (mean 3Â·3 adverse events per participant). The most common adverse events were headache (n=6 [21%] in participants who received SAB-301 and n=2 [20%] in those receiving placebo), albuminuria (n=5 [18%] vs n=2 [20%]), myalgia (n=3 [11%] vs n=1 [10%]), increased creatine kinase (n=3 [11%] vs 1 [10%]), and common cold (n=3 [11%] vs n=2 [20%]). There was one serious adverse event (hospital admission for suicide attempt) in one participant who received 50 mg/kg of SAB-301. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in the 50 mg/kg dose (27â€ˆ498 Î¼gâ€ˆÃ—â€ˆdays per mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with efficacy in a preclinical model. Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants.

"A cohort study of the effect of winter dysentery on herd-level milk production","Winter dysentery (WD) is a contagious disease caused by bovine coronavirus. It is characterized by acute onset of diarrhea, fever, depression, and reduced milk yield in adult cattle. Although production loss is a well-known consequence of WD, large-scale studies estimating the effect on milk production are lacking. The objective of this study was to estimate the effect of farmer-reported WD on herd-level milk production and milk composition. A cohort study was performed based on reports of herd outbreaks of winter dysentery during a regional epidemic in Norway during the winter of 2011-2012. Reports were made by farmers, and diagnosis was based on a herd outbreak of acute diarrhea in adults. Milk shipment data were retrieved from the dairy company, and information on herd size and milking system were retrieved from the Norwegian Dairy Herd Recording System. We compared milk production in herds with reported outbreaks of WD (n = 224) with all herds in the same area without a reported outbreak (n = 2,093) during the same period. The outcome variable in the analysis was milk volume per cow per day, and the main predictor was whether the herd had a reported outbreak of WD or not. We assessed the effect of WD on milk production by fitting a linear mixed model, adjusting for milk production in the herd before the outbreak. Similarly, we assessed the effect of WD on milk composition using linear regression, adjusting for the levels of milk components before the outbreak. This study estimated a total loss of 51 L/cow during the study period, from 7 d before to 19 d after a reported outbreak. The lowest estimated production was 2 d after the outbreak was reported, when the average milk yield was 19.4 L/cow per day, compared with 23.0 L/cow per day 7 days before notification (i.e., a difference of 3.6 L/cow, or 15%). The effect gradually declined with time. The estimated effect on milk composition was modest, but an increase of 11% in free fatty acids and a small increase in fat/protein ratio indicated that WD might put cows into negative energy balance. Descriptive analysis indicated that herd milk yield was still reduced 4 mo after an outbreak. This cohort study showed that WD causes considerable decreases in milk production, and it alters milk composition. These findings highlight the important negative consequences of WD, and should motivate actions to prevent between-herd spread of bovine coronavirus.","Toftaker, HolmÃ¸y, NÃ¸dtvedt, Ã˜sterÃ¥s, Stokstad","https://doi.org/10.3168/jds.2017-12605","20180427","bovine coronavirus; dairy; milk composition; milk yield; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Cohort Studies; Dairying; Dysentery; Female; Lactation; Milk; Norway","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Transmissible gastroenteritis virus infection induces NF-ÎºB activation through RLR-mediated signaling","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a porcine enteric coronavirus which causes lethal severe watery diarrhea in piglets. The pathogenesis of TGEV is strongly associated with inflammation. In this study, we found that TGEV infection activates transcription factors NF-ÎºB, IRF3 and AP-1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner in porcine kidney cells. Treatment with the NF-ÎºB-specific inhibitor BAY11-7082 significantly decreased TGEV-induced proinflammatory cytokine production, but did not affect virus replication. Phosphorylation of NF-ÎºB subunit p65 and proinflammatory cytokine production were greatly decreased after knockdown of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) or its adaptors MAVS and STING, while only slight reduction was observed in cells following silencing of Toll-like receptor adaptors, MyD88 and TRIF. Furthermore, TGEV infection significantly upregulated mRNA expression of RIG-I and MDA5. Taken together, our results indicate that the RLR signaling pathway is involved in TGEV-induced inflammatory responses.","Ding, An, Xie, Wu, Zhang, Wang, Fang, Chen, Xiao, Fang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2017.04.024","20170717","Inflammatory response; NF-ÎºB; RIG-I-like receptors; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; Animals; Cytokines; DEAD Box Protein 58; Gastroenteritis, Transmissible, of Swine; Interferon-Induced Helicase, IFIH1; NF-kappa B; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; Swine; Transcription Factor AP-1; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A novel benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30 inhibits influenza virus replication by depression of Inosine-5'-Monophospate Dehydrogenase activity","Influenza virus is still a huge threat to the world-wide public health. Host inosine-5'- monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) involved in the synthesis of guanine nucleotides, is known to be a potential target to inhibit the replication of viruses. Herein, we evaluated antiviral activity of a benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative N30, which was designed to inhibit IMPDH. The results demonstrated that N30 inhibited the replication of H1N1, H3N2, influenza B viruses, including oseltamivir and amantadine resistant strains in vitro. Mechanistically, neuraminidase inhibition assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay suggested that N30 did not directly target the two envelope glycoproteins required for viral adsorption or release. Instead, the compound could depress the activity of IMPDH type II. Based on these findings, we further confirmed that N30 provided a strong inhibition on the replication of respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and a diverse strains of coxsackie B virus. We identified the small molecule N30, as an inhibitor of IMPDH, might be a potential candidate to inhibit the replication of various viruses.","Hu, Ma, Wang, Yan, Zhang, Li, Jiang, Li","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-017-0724-6","20170828","Benzo-heterocyclic amine derivative; IMPDH; Influenza A virus; Amines; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line; Coronavirus; Enterovirus A, Human; Enterovirus B, Human; Enzyme Inhibitors; Heterocyclic Compounds; Humans; IMP Dehydrogenase; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza B virus; Respiratory Syncytial Viruses; Virus Replication","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health status of people isolated due to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome","Isolation due to the management of infectious diseases is thought to affect mental health, but the effects are still unknown. We examined the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and anger in persons isolated during the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic both at isolation period and at four to six months after release from isolation. We also determined risk factors associated with these symptoms at four to six months. Of 14,992 individuals isolated for 2-week due to having contact with MERS patients in 2015, when MERS was introduced to Korea, 1,692 individuals were included in this study. Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale and anger was assessed with the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory at four to six months after release from isolation for MERS. Of 1,692 who came in contact with MERS patients, 1,656 were not diagnosed with MERS. Among 1,656, anxiety symptoms showed 7.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3 to 8.9%) and feelings of anger were present in 16.6% (95% CI, 14.8 to 18.4%) during the isolation period. At four to six months after release from isolation, anxiety symptoms were observed in 3.0% (95%CI, 2.2 to 3.9%). Feelings of anger were present in 6.4% (95% CI, 5.2 to 7.6%). Risk factors for experiencing anxiety symptoms and anger at four to six months after release included symptoms related to MERS during isolation, inadequate supplies (food, clothes, accommodation), social networking activities (email, text, Internet), history of psychiatric illnesses, and financial loss. Mental health problems at four to six month after release from isolation might be prevented by providing mental health support to individuals with vulnerable mental health, and providing accurate information as well as appropriate supplies, including food, clothes, and accommodation.","Jeong, Yim, Song, Ki, Min, Cho, Chae","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2016048","20170216","Anger; Anxiety; Isolation; Korea; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus; Adult; Anxiety; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus; Patient Isolation; Republic of Korea; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Frequency, clinicopathological features and phylogenetic analysis of feline morbillivirus in cats in Istanbul, Turkey","Objectives The aim of the study was to investigate feline morbillivirus (FmoPV) frequency, phylogeny and associated pathology in cats in Istanbul, Turkey. Methods Samples from sick (n = 96) and dead ( n = 15) cats were analysed using reverse transcription PCR. Blood and urine analyses and histopathology were also performed. Results FmoPV RNA was detected in six cats (5.4%), including three sick (in the urine) and three dead cats (tissues). A significantly greater proportion of FmoPV RNA-positive cats had street access compared with non-infected cats. Blood samples from the morbillivirus-positive cats were negative for morbillivirus RNA. Tubular parenchymal cells, lymphoid and plasma cells in kidney and hepatocytes, lymphoid and plasma cells in liver from dead cats were also positive by immunohistochemistry for the viral N protein. Two FmoPV-positive cats were also positive for feline coronavirus RNA and one cat for feline immunodeficiency virus RNA and feline leukaemia virus proviral DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the six FmoPV-positive cats showed that the strains were grouped into cluster D and had high similarity (98.5-100%) with strains from Japan and Germany. In the three FmoPV RNA-positive sick cats, respiratory, urinary and digestive system signs were observed as well as weight loss, fever and depression in some cats. Similar clinical signs were also seen in the morbillivirus RNA-negative sick cats. FmoPV RNA-positive cats had lower median red blood cell count, haemoglobin, albumin, albumin/globulin and urobilinogen and higher alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin compared with non-infected cats. Significant histopathology of FmoPV RNA-positive dead cats included tubulointerstitial nephritis characterised by severe granular and vacuolar degeneration of the epithelial cells of the cortical and medullary tubules as well as mononuclear cell infiltrates. Widespread lymphoid cell infiltrates were detected in the renal cortex and medullary regions of the kidneys. Cellular infiltration, cholangiohepatitis and focal necrosis in the liver were also found. Although virus-infected cells were found in the kidney and liver of FmoRV RNA-positive cats, tubulointerstitial nephritis, cholangiohepatitis and focal necrosis seen in FmoRV RNA-positive cats were similar to those observed in FmoRV RNA-negative cats. Conclusions and relevance This is the first study to show the presence of FmoPV infection in cats in Turkey. Sick cats, particularly those with kidney disease, should be tested for this virus. The genotypes found in this study were similar to previously reported strains, indicating that circulating morbilliviruses in Turkey are conserved.","Yilmaz, Tekelioglu, Gurel, Bamac, Ozturk, Cizmecigil, Altan, Aydin, Yilmaz, Berriatua, Helps, Richt, Turan","https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612X16686728","20171215","Animals; Cat Diseases; Cats; Female; Male; Morbillivirus; Morbillivirus Infections; Phylogeny; Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Viral; Turkey","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The impact of epidemics on labor market: identifying victims of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in the Korean labor market","The vulnerability approach suggests that disasters such as epidemics have different effects according not only to physical vulnerability but also to economic class (status). This paper examines the effect of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic on the labor market to investigate whether vulnerable groups become more vulnerable due to an interaction between the socio-economic structure and physical risk. This paper examines the effect of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome epidemic on the labor market by considering unemployment status, job status, working hours, reason for unemployment and underemployment status. In particular, the study investigates whether the U-shaped curve becomes a J-shaped curve due to the interaction between medical vulnerability and labor market vulnerability after an outbreak, assuming that the relative vulnerability in the labor market by age shows a U curve with peaks for the young group and middle aged and old aged groups using the Economically Active Population Survey. We use the difference in difference approach and also conduct a falsification check and robustness check. The results suggest that older workers faced a higher possibility of unemployment after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. In particular, they experienced higher involuntary unemployment and underemployment status as well as decreased working hours. It was confirmed that the relative vulnerability of the labor market for older workers was higher than for the other age groups after the epidemic outbreak due to the double whammy of vulnerability in the medical and labor market. The vulnerability in the young group partially increased compared to the 30s and 40s age groups due to their relative vulnerability in the labor market despite being healthy. We find that assuming the relative vulnerability in the existing labor market shows a U shape with age increase, the U-shaped curve became J-shaped after the outbreak. Disasters like epidemics can occur unexpectedly and affect certain groups more than other. Therefore, medical protection should be enhanced for groups vulnerable to disease and economic measures are also required for the protection of their livelihoods in the labor market to prevent unemployment stemming from inequality.","Lee, Cho","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-016-0483-9","20180209","Epidemics; Labor Market; Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; Older workers; Quarantine; Unemployment; Vulnerability; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Coronavirus Infections; Employment; Epidemics; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Social Class; Social Problems; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Young Adult","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The evidence of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus induced nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets","An acute outbreak of porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) infection in piglets, characterized with neurological symptoms, vomiting, diarrhea, and wasting, occurred in China. Coronavirus-like particles were observed in the homogenized tissue suspensions of the brain of dead piglets by electron microscopy, and a wild PHEV strain was isolated, characterized, and designated as PHEV-CC14. Histopathologic examinations of the dead piglets showed characteristics of non-suppurative encephalitis, and some neurons in the cerebral cortex were degenerated and necrotic, and neuronophagia. Similarly, mice inoculated with PHEV-CC14 were found to have central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction, with symptoms of depression, arched waists, standing and vellicating front claws. Furthmore, PHEV-positive labeling of neurons in cortices of dead piglets and infected mice supported the viral infections of the nervous system. Then, the major structural genes of PHEV-CC14 were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed, and the strain shared 95%-99.2% nt identity with the other PHEV strains available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis clearly proved that the wild strain clustered into a subclass with a HEV-JT06 strain. These findings suggested that the virus had a strong tropism for CNS, in this way, inducing nonsuppurative encephalitis as the cause of death in piglets. Simultaneously, the predicted risk of widespread transmission showed a certain variation among the PHEV strains currently circulating around the world. Above all, the information presented in this study can not only provide good reference for the experimental diagnosis of PHEV infection for pig breeding, but also promote its new effective vaccine development.

"Mood disorders and non-celiac gluten sensitivity","The association between gluten related disorders and psychiatric diseases has been firmly demonstrated. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a syndrome diagnosed in patients responsive to gluten-free diet after ruling out celiac disease and wheat allergy. The pathogenesis of neuro-psychiatric disorders in NCGS is unclear. An association between gluten and schizophrenia was described for the first time in 1950 by Bender et al. In the 1950's, Dicke noted that gluten-free diet improved mood in celiac patients. In 1970, Goldberg et al., in a study of 80 celiac patients, found that 34% of them showed minor affective disorders. Bipolar disorder patients show an increase of blood anti gliadin deamidated antibodies (IgG). The effect of diet and nutrition on autistic spectrum disorders has been investigated in the last two decades, particularly focusing on the symptoms of hyperactivity and attention. Toxoplasma gondii and other neurotropic pathogens as Influenzavirus and Coronavirus may be associated with mood disorders, probably secondary to an increased intestinal permeability. Abnormalities of host-microbiota interactions or of gut-microbiota composition have been associated with central nervous system disorders, such as autism, anxiety, depression and the integrity of intestinal microbiota may be considered a potential therapeutic goal to treat these conditions.","Casella, Pozzi, Cigognetti, Bachetti, Torti, Cadei, Villanacci, Baldini, Bassotti","https://doi.org/10.23736/S1121-421X.16.02325-4","20170911","Autistic Disorder; Bipolar Disorder; Food Hypersensitivity; Glutens; Hallucinations; Humans; Mood Disorders; Schizophrenia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Viral Macro Domains Reverse Protein ADP-Ribosylation","ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational protein modification in which ADP-ribose is transferred from NAD(+) to specific acceptors to regulate a wide variety of cellular processes. The macro domain is an ancient and highly evolutionarily conserved protein domain widely distributed throughout all kingdoms of life, including viruses. The human TARG1/C6orf130, MacroD1, and MacroD2 proteins can reverse ADP-ribosylation by acting on ADP-ribosylated substrates through the hydrolytic activity of their macro domains. Here, we report that the macro domain from hepatitis E virus (HEV) serves as an ADP-ribose-protein hydrolase for mono-ADP-ribose (MAR) and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chain removal (de-MARylation and de-PARylation, respectively) from mono- and poly(ADP)-ribosylated proteins, respectively. The presence of the HEV helicase in cis dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to poly(ADP-ribose) and stimulates the de-PARylation activity. Abrogation of the latter dramatically decreases replication of an HEV subgenomic replicon. The de-MARylation activity is present in all three pathogenic positive-sense, single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] virus families which carry a macro domain: Coronaviridae (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E), Togaviridae (Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus), and Hepeviridae (HEV), indicating that it might be a significant tropism and/or pathogenic determinant. Protein ADP-ribosylation is a covalent posttranslational modification regulating cellular protein activities in a dynamic fashion to modulate and coordinate a variety of cellular processes. Three viral families, Coronaviridae, Togaviridae, and Hepeviridae, possess macro domains embedded in their polyproteins. Here, we show that viral macro domains reverse cellular ADP-ribosylation, potentially cutting the signal of a viral infection in the cell. Various poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases which are notorious guardians of cellular integrity are demodified by macro domains from members of these virus families. In the case of hepatitis E virus, the adjacent viral helicase domain dramatically increases the binding of the macro domain to PAR and simulates the demodification activity.","Li, Debing, Jankevicius, Neyts, Ahel, Coutard, Canard","https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00705-16","20170510","Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose; Hepatitis E virus; Humans; Hydrolysis; Polyproteins; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Viral Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Bovine coronavirus in naturally and experimentally exposed calves; viral shedding and the potential for transmission","Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is a widely distributed pathogen, causing disease and economic losses in the cattle industry worldwide. Prevention of virus spread is impeded by a lack of basic knowledge concerning viral shedding and transmission potential in individual animals. The aims of the study were to investigate the duration and quantity of BCoV shedding in feces and nasal secretions related to clinical signs, the presence of virus in blood and tissues and to test the hypothesis that seropositive calves are not infectious to naÃ¯ve in-contact calves three weeks after BCoV infection. A live animal experiment was conducted, with direct contact between animal groups for 24 h as challenge procedure. Four naÃ¯ve calves were commingled with a group of six naturally infected calves and sequentially euthanized. Two naÃ¯ve sentinel calves were commingled with the experimentally exposed group three weeks after exposure. Nasal swabs, feces, blood and tissue samples were analyzed for viral RNA by RT-qPCR, and virus isolation was performed on nasal swabs. Serum was analyzed for BCoV antibodies. The calves showed mild general signs, and the most prominent signs were from the respiratory system. The overall clinical score corresponded well with the shedding of viral RNA the first three weeks after challenge. General depression and cough were the signs that correlated best with shedding of BCoV RNA, while peak respiratory rate and peak rectal temperature appeared more than a week later than the peak shedding. Nasal shedding preceded fecal shedding, and the calves had detectable amounts of viral RNA intermittently in feces through day 35 and in nasal secretions through day 28, however virus isolation was unsuccessful from day six and day 18 from the two calves investigated. Viral RNA was not detected in blood, but was found in lymphatic tissue through day 42 after challenge. Although the calves were shedding BCoV RNA 21 days after infection the sentinel animals were not infected. Prolonged shedding of BCoV RNA can occur, but detection of viral RNA does not necessarily indicate a transmission potential. The study provides valuable information with regard to producing scientifically based biosecurity advices.","Oma, TrÃ¥vÃ©n, Alenius, Myrmel, Stokstad","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12985-016-0555-x","20161213","BCV; BCoV; Biosecurity; Clinical signs; Experimental infection; RT-qPCR; Transmission potential; Viremia; Virus isolation; Virus quantification; Virus shedding; Animal Experimentation; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Blood; Bodily Secretions; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus, Bovine; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Feces; Nasal Cavity; RNA, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Virus Shedding","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mutagenesis of S-Adenosyl-l-Methionine-Binding Residues in Coronavirus nsp14 N7-Methyltransferase Demonstrates Differing Requirements for Genome Translation and Resistance to Innate Immunity","Eukaryotic mRNAs possess a methylated 5'-guanosine cap that is required for RNA stability, efficient translation, and protection from cell-intrinsic defenses. Many viruses use 5' caps or other mechanisms to mimic a cap structure to limit detection of viral RNAs by intracellular innate sensors and to direct efficient translation of viral proteins. The coronavirus (CoV) nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) is a multifunctional protein with N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity. The highly conserved S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM)-binding residues of the DxG motif are required for nsp14 N7-MTase activity in vitro However, the requirement for CoV N7-MTase activity and the importance of the SAM-binding residues during viral replication have not been determined. Here, we engineered mutations in murine hepatitis virus (MHV) nsp14 N7-MTase at residues D330 and G332 and determined the effects of these mutations on viral replication, sensitivity to mutagen, inhibition by type I interferon (IFN), and translation efficiency. Virus encoding a G332A substitution in nsp14 displayed delayed replication kinetics and decreased peak titers relative to wild-type (WT) MHV. In addition, replication of nsp14 G332A virus was diminished following treatment of cells with IFN-Î², and nsp14 G332A genomes were translated less efficiently both in vitro and during viral infection. In contrast, substitution of alanine at MHV nsp14 D330 did not affect viral replication, sensitivity to mutagen, or inhibition by IFN-Î² compared to WT MHV. Our results demonstrate that the conserved MHV N7-MTase SAM-binding-site residues are not required for MHV viability and suggest that the determinants of CoV N7-MTase activity differ in vitro and during virus infection. Human coronaviruses, most notably severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, cause severe and lethal human disease. Since specific antiviral therapies are not available for the treatment of human coronavirus infections, it is essential to understand the functions of conserved CoV proteins in viral replication. Here, we show that substitution of alanine at G332 in the N7-MTase domain of nsp14 impairs viral replication, enhances sensitivity to the innate immune response, and reduces viral RNA translation efficiency. Our data support the idea that coronavirus RNA capping could be targeted for development of antiviral therapeutics.","Case, Ashbrook, Dermody, Denison","https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00542-16","20170515","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Brain Neoplasms; Cells, Cultured; Coronavirus; DNA Mutational Analysis; Genome, Viral; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Immunomodulation; Interferon-beta; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Viral; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Viral Nonstructural Proteins; Virus Replication","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Infectious bronchitis virus and brown shell colour: Australian strains of infectious bronchitis virus affect brown eggshell colour in commercial laying hens differently","The aim of the current study was to assess any effect of wild and vaccine Australian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains on shell colour in brown-shelled eggs. In Experiment 1, eggs were collected from day 1 to day 13 post-inoculation (p.i.) from unvaccinated laying hens challenged with IBV wild strains T and N1/88 and from a negative control group of hens. In Experiment 2, eggs were collected from 2 to 22 days p.i. from unvaccinated and vaccinated laying hens challenged with either a wild or a vaccine strain of IBV. In Experiment 1, there was a significant effect (Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰0.05) of day p.i. and of viral strain on shell reflectivity, L* and protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) in eggshells, with and without cuticle. The mean PP IX/g of shell with and without cuticle was significantly higher on day 1 p.i. compared to day 7, after which PP IX increased with day p.i. In Experiment 2, shell reflectivity and L* increased and PP IX decreased with increased day p.i. until day 12. Shell reflectivity and L* decreased slightly after day 12 and increased again towards day 22. Shell reflectivity, L* and PP IX were not significantly different for eggshells from unvaccinated and vaccinated laying hens in the intact eggshell, but were significantly different in shells from which cuticle had been removed. In conclusion, the IBV strains reduced the intensity of brown shell colour to different extents with a lower amount of PP IX in eggshells.

"Equine coronavirus: An emerging enteric virus of adult horses","Equine coronavirus (ECoV) is an emerging virus associated clinically and epidemiologically with fever, depression, anorexia and less frequently colic and diarrhoea in adult horses. Sporadic cases and outbreaks have been reported with increased frequency since 2010 from Japan, the USA and more recently from Europe. A faeco-oral transmission route is suspected and clinical or asymptomatic infected horses appear to be responsible for direct and indirect transmission of ECoV. A presumptive clinical diagnosis of ECoV infection may be suggested by clinical presentation, haematological abnormalities such as leucopenia due to lymphopenia and/or neutropenia. Confirmation of ECoV infection is provided by specific ECoV nucleic acid detection in faeces by quantitative PCR (qPCR) or demonstration of coronavirus antigen by immunohistochemistry or electron microscopy in intestinal biopsy material obtained <i>ante</i> or <i>post mortem</i>. The disease is generally self-limiting and horses typically recover with symptomatic supportive care. Complications associated with disruption of the gastrointestinal barrier have been reported in some infected horses and include endotoxaemia, septicaemia and hyperammonaemia-associated encephalopathy. Although specific immunoprophylactic measures have been shown to be effective in disease prevention for closely-related coronaviruses such as bovine coronavirus (BCoV), such strategies have yet not been investigated for horses and disease prevention is limited to basic biosecurity protocols. This article reviews current knowledge concerning the aetiology, epidemiology, clinical signs, diagnosis, pathology, treatment and prevention of ECoV infection in adult horses.","Pusterla, Vin, Leutenegger, Mittel, Divers","https://doi.org/10.1111/eve.12453","20200424","clinical signs; diagnosis; equine coronavirus; horse; treatment","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Age-Related Susceptibility of Turkeys to Enteric Viruses","Several different enteric viruses have been identified as the causes of gastrointestinal infections in poultry. Enteric virus infections are well characterized in poults, but limited studies have been conducted in older birds. The susceptibility of 2-, 7-, 12-, 30-, and 52-wk-old turkeys to turkey coronavirus (TCoV) and turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was evaluated, as well as the effect of combined infection of TAstV and TCoV in 2-wk-old poults and turkey hens. From cloacal swabs and intestines, TCoV was consistently detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR throughout the experimental period (1-21 days postinoculation [DPI]) from all age groups. In contrast, the last detection point of TAstV gradually decreased to 21, 16, and 12 DPI in birds inoculated at 2, 7, and 12 wk of age, respectively, and viral RNA was rarely detected from cloacal swabs or intestinal contents in turkey hens within 3 DPI. Infection with TAstV alone did not affect body weight in poults or egg production in hens. The combined infection of TAstV and TCoV did not induce more severe clinical signs and pathology than the TCoV infection alone. However, a severe prolonged decrease in egg production (about 50%) was observed in turkey hens in the combined infection group compared with a transient egg production drop in the TCoV-infected hens alone. The underlying mechanism regarding the age-related TAstV susceptibility and the pathogenesis of the TAstV and TCoV coinfection in layer hens needs to be further elucidated.

"Differential effects of viroporin inhibitors against feline infectious peritonitis virus serotypes I and II","Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIP virus: FIPV), a feline coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae, causes a fatal disease called FIP in wild and domestic cat species. The genome of coronaviruses encodes a hydrophobic transmembrane protein, the envelope (E) protein. The E protein possesses ion channel activity. Viral proteins with ion channel activity are collectively termed &quot;viroporins&quot;. Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), a viroporin inhibitor, can inhibit the ion channel activity of the E protein and replication of several coronaviruses. However, it is not clear whether HMA and other viroporin inhibitors affect replication of FIPV. We examined the effect of HMA and other viroporin inhibitors (DIDS [4,4'-disothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulphonic acid] and amantadine) on infection by FIPV serotypes I and II. HMA treatment drastically decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2 in a dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146. In contrast, DIDS treatment decreased the titer of FIPV serotype II strain 79-1146 in dose-dependent manner, but it only slightly decreased the titers of FIPV serotype I strains Black and KU-2. We investigated whether there is a difference in ion channel activity of the E protein between viral serotypes using E. coli cells expressing the E protein of FIPV serotypes I and II. No difference was observed, suggesting that a viroporin other than the E protein influences the differences in the actions of HMA and DIDS on FIPV serotypes I and II.

"Knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in multispecialty hospitals of Qassim, Saudi Arabia","With the increase in prevalence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk of acquiring and subsequently transmitting this lethal virus. In view of this, HCWs were evaluated for their knowledge of and attitude towards MERS in Saudi Arabia. A cross sectional study was performed in two hospitals of Qassim region in Saudi Arabia. A total of 280 healthcare workers were selected to participate in this study. Knowledge and attitude were assessed by using self-administered and pretested questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were carried out to express participants' demographic information, mean knowledge score and mean attitude score of HCWs. Inferential statistics (Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal Wallis tests, p &lt; 0.05) were used to examine differences between study variables. Chi squares tests were used to assess the association between study variables and attitude questions. Spearman's rho correlation was used to identify the association between the knowledge, attitude scores. Participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. The mean scores of knowledge and attitude were 9.45 Â± 1.69 (based on 13 knowledge questions) and 1.82 Â± 0.72 (based on 7 attitude questions). The correlation between knowledge and attitude was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.12; P &lt;0.001). HCWs were less educated about the management (42.4%), source (66%) and consequences of MERS (67.3%), while a majority of them were well aware of the hallmark symptoms (96%), precautionary measures (96%) and hygiene issues (94%). Although the majority of respondents showed positive attitude towards the use of protective measures (1.52 Â± 0.84), their attitude was negative towards their active participation in infection control program (2.03 Â± 0.97). Gender and experience were significantly associated with knowledge and attitude (P &lt; 0.05). The findings of this study showed that healthcare workers in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia have good knowledge and positive attitude towards MERS. Yet there are areas where low knowledge and negative attitude of HCWs was observed. However, studies are required to assess the knowledge and attitude of HCWs at national level so that effective interventions could be designed as surveillance and infection control measures are critical to global public health.","Khan, Shah, Ahmad, Fatokun","https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2458-14-1281","20150914","Adult; Coronavirus Infections; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Hospitals; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Middle Aged; Saudi Arabia; Sex Factors","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Distinct CD4 T-cell effects on primary versus recall CD8 T-cell responses during viral encephalomyelitis","CD4 T-cell help is not a universal requirement for effective primary CD8 T cells but is essential to generate memory CD8 T cells capable of recall responses. This study examined how CD4 T cells affect primary and secondary anti-viral CD8 T-cell responses within the central nervous system (CNS) during encephalomyelitis induced by sublethal gliatropic coronavirus. CD4 T-cell depletion before infection did not impair peripheral expansion, interferon-Î³ production, CNS recruitment or initial CNS effector capacity of virus-specific CD8 T cells ex vivo. Nevertheless, impaired virus control in the absence of CD4 T cells was associated with gradually diminished CNS CD8 T-cell interferon-Î³ production. Furthermore, within the CD8 T-cell population short-lived effector cells were increased and memory precursor effector cells were significantly decreased, consistent with higher T-cell turnover. Transfer of memory CD8 T cells to reduce viral load in CD4-depleted mice reverted the recipient CNS CD8 T-cell phenotype to that in wild-type control mice. However, memory CD8 T cells primed without CD4 T cells and transferred into infected CD4-sufficient recipients expanded less efficiently and were not sustained in the CNS, contrasting with their helped counterparts. These data suggest that CD4 T cells are dispensable for initial expansion, CNS recruitment and differentiation of primary resident memory CD8 T cells as long as the duration of antigen exposure is limited. By contrast, CD4 T cells are essential to prolong primary CD8 T-cell function in the CNS and imprint memory CD8 T cells for recall responses.","Hwang, Phares, Hinton, Stohlman, Bergmann, Min","https://doi.org/10.1111/imm.12378","20191120","CD4 help; CD8 T cells; central nervous system; inflammation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Virus-specific regulatory T cells ameliorate encephalitis by repressing effector T cell functions from priming to effector stages","Several studies have demonstrated the presence of pathogen-specific Foxp3+ CD4 regulatory T cells (Treg) in infected animals, but little is known about where and how these cells affect the effector T cell responses and whether they are more suppressive than bulk Treg populations. We recently showed the presence of both epitope M133-specific Tregs (M133 Treg) and conventional CD4 T cells (M133 Tconv) in the brains of mice with coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Here, we provide new insights into the interactions between pathogenic Tconv and Tregs responding to the same epitope. M133 Tregs inhibited the proliferation but not initial activation of M133 Tconv in draining lymph nodes (DLN). Further, M133 Tregs inhibited migration of M133 Tconv from the DLN. In addition, M133 Tregs diminished microglia activation and decreased the number and function of Tconv in the infected brain. Thus, virus-specific Tregs inhibited pathogenic CD4 T cell responses during priming and effector stages, particularly those recognizing cognate antigen, and decreased mortality and morbidity without affecting virus clearance. These cells are more suppressive than bulk Tregs and provide a targeted approach to ameliorating immunopathological disease in infectious settings.

"IL-27 limits central nervous system viral clearance by promoting IL-10 and enhances demyelination","IL-27 is a pleiotropic member of the IL-6 and IL-12 cytokine family composed of the IL-27p28 and the EBV-induced gene 3. IL-27 and its receptor mRNA are both upregulated in the CNS during acute encephalomyelitis induced by the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) and sustained during viral persistence. Contributions of IL-27 to viral pathogenesis were evaluated by infection of IL-27RÎ±-chain-deficient (IL-27RÎ±(-/-)) mice. The absence of IL-27 signaling accelerated virus control within the CNS associated with increased IFN-Î³ secreting virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Abrogation of IL-27 signaling did not affect virus-specific CD8+ T cell-mediated IL-10 production or cytolytic activity or Foxp3+ regulatory T cell populations. However, IL-10 production by virus-specific CD4+ T cells was reduced significantly. Despite increased T cell-mediated antiviral function in IL-27RÎ±(-/-) mice, the virus persisted in the CNS at similar levels as in wild-type mice. Nevertheless, IL-27RÎ±(-/-) mice exhibited decreased clinical disease during persistence, coincident with less severe demyelination, the hallmark tissue damage associated with JHMV infection. Overall, these data demonstrate that in contrast to viral infections at other sites, IL-27 does not play a proinflammatory role during JHMV-induced encephalomyelitis. Rather, it limits CNS inflammation and impairs control of CNS virus replication via induction of IL-10 in virus-specific CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, in contrast to its protective role in limiting CNS autoimmunity and preventing immunopathology, these data define a detrimental role of IL-27 in promoting demyelination by delaying viral control.","de Aquino, Kapil, Hinton, Phares, Puntambekar, Savarin, Bergmann, Stohlman","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1400058","20140818","Animals; Central Nervous System; Coronavirus Infections; Demyelinating Diseases; Encephalomyelitis, Acute Disseminated; Interleukin-10; Interleukins; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Murine hepatitis virus; Signal Transduction; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

To test the contribution of E protein IC activity in virus pathogenesis, two recombinant mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs, each containing one single amino acid mutation that suppressed ion conductivity, were engineered. After serial infections, mutant viruses, in general, incorporated compensatory mutations within E gene that rendered active ion channels. Furthermore, IC activity conferred better fitness in competition assays, suggesting that ion conductivity represents an advantage for the virus. Interestingly, mice infected with viruses displaying E protein IC activity, either with the wild-type E protein sequence or with the revertants that restored ion transport, rapidly lost weight and died. In contrast, mice infected with mutants lacking IC activity, which did not incorporate mutations within E gene during the experiment, recovered from disease and most survived. Knocking down E protein IC activity did not significantly affect virus growth in infected mice but decreased edema accumulation, the major determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to death. Reduced edema correlated with lung epithelia integrity and proper localization of Na+/K+ ATPase, which participates in edema resolution. Levels of inflammasome-activated IL-1Î² were reduced in the lung airways of the animals infected with viruses lacking E protein IC activity, indicating that E protein IC function is required for inflammasome activation. Reduction of IL-1Î² was accompanied by diminished amounts of TNF and IL-6 in the absence of E protein ion conductivity. All these key cytokines promote the progression of lung damage and ARDS pathology. In conclusion, E protein IC activity represents a new determinant for SARS-CoV virulence.

"Comparative survey of canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus and canine enteric coronavirus infection in free-ranging wolves of central Italy and south-eastern France","Diseases likely affect large carnivore demography and can hinder conservation efforts. We considered three highly contagious viruses that infect a wide range of domestic and wild mammals: canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine distemper virus (CDV) and canine enteric coronaviruses (CECoV). Infection by either one of these viruses can affect populations through increased mortality and/or decreased general health. We investigated infection in the wolf populations of Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise National Park (PNALM), Italy, and of Mercantour National Park (PNM), France. Faecal samples were collected during one winter, from October to March, from four packs in PNALM (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰79) and from four packs in PNM (<i>n</i>â€‰=â€‰66). We screened samples for specific sequences of viral nucleic acids. To our knowledge, our study is the first documented report of CECoV infection in wolves outside Alaska, and of the large-scale occurrence of CPV-2 in European wolf populations. The results suggest that CPV-2 is enzootic in the population of PNALM, but not in PNM and that CECoV is episodic in both areas. We did not detect CDV. Our findings suggest that density and spatial distribution of susceptible hosts, in particular free-ranging dogs, can be important factors influencing infections in wolves. This comparative study is an important step in evaluating the nature of possible disease threats in the studied wolf populations. Recent emergence of new viral strains in Europe additionally strengthens the need for proactive monitoring of wolves and other susceptible sympatric species for viral threats and other impairing infections.","Molnar, Duchamp, MÃ¶stl, Diehl, Betschart","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10344-014-0825-0","20200331","Canis lupus; Emerging viral strain; Free-ranging dog; Host density; Infectious disease","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Role of CD25(+) CD4(+) T cells in acute and persistent coronavirus infection of the central nervous system","The influence of CD25(+)CD4(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) on acute and chronic viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) was examined using a glial tropic murine coronavirus. Treg in the CNS were highest during initial T cell mediated virus control, decreased and then remained relatively stable during persistence. Anti-CD25 treatment did not affect CNS recruitment of inflammatory cells. Viral control was initially delayed; however, neither the kinetics of viral control nor viral persistence were affected. By contrast, the absence of Treg during the acute phase resulted in increased demyelination during viral persistence. These data suggest that CNS inflammation, progression of viral control and viral persistence are relatively independent of CD25(+)CD4(+) Treg. However, their absence during acute infection alters the ability of the host to limit tissue damage.

"Proteolytic activation of the SARS-coronavirus spike protein: cutting enzymes at the cutting edge of antiviral research","The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic revealed that zoonotic transmission of animal coronaviruses (CoV) to humans poses a significant threat to public health and warrants surveillance and the development of countermeasures. The activity of host cell proteases, which cleave and activate the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, is essential for viral infectivity and constitutes a target for intervention. However, the identities of the proteases involved have been unclear. Pioneer studies identified cathepsins and type II transmembrane serine proteases as cellular activators of SARS-CoV and demonstrated that several emerging viruses might exploit these enzymes to promote their spread. Here, we will review the proteolytic systems hijacked by SARS-CoV for S protein activation, we will discuss their contribution to viral spread in the host and we will outline antiviral strategies targeting these enzymes.

"The occurrence of enteric viruses in Light Turkey Syndrome","Two studies were conducted to determine the role of enteric viruses in Light Turkey Syndrome (LTS), which is characterized by lower weight in market age turkeys than their standard breed character. In the surveillance study, we selected four LTS and two non-LTS turkey flocks in Minnesota and collected faecal samples at 2, 3, 5 and 8-weeks of age. Astrovirus, rotavirus, and reovirus were detected alone or in various combinations in both LTS and non-LTS flocks. No coronavirus was detected in LTS flocks and no corona- or reovirus was detected in non-LTS flocks. In the second study, 2-week-old turkey poults were divided into two groups; Group A (challenged) was inoculated orally with 10% pooled faecal suspension from LTS flocks and group B (control) was inoculated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Clinical signs of depression, huddling, and lack of uniform size were observed in the challenged group but not in the control group. diarrhoea was observed in both groups but was more severe in the challenged group than in the control group. Birds in the challenged group shed astrovirus, rotavirus and reovirus, while the control group shed only astrovirus. Virus shedding in both groups was observed for up to nine weeks of age. Significantly lower body weights were seen in the challenged group starting at seven weeks of age and lasting until 20 weeks of age. These findings suggest that viral enteritis at an early age may set up conditions for the development of LTS in adult turkeys.

After sequence analysis, the scFv/6E6 gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6p-1 with a GST-tag. The recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was successfully expressed in recombinant Escherichia coli by IPTG induction. Moreover, the recombinant scFv/6E6 protein was purified from the inclusion body form by the gel-cutting measure followed by electroelution and dialysis.

"A framework for the study of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers: spillover of bat pathogens as a case study","Many serious emerging zoonotic infections have recently arisen from bats, including Ebola, Marburg, SARS-coronavirus, Hendra, Nipah, and a number of rabies and rabies-related viruses, consistent with the overall observation that wildlife are an important source of emerging zoonoses for the human population. Mechanisms underlying the recognized association between ecosystem health and human health remain poorly understood and responding appropriately to the ecological, social and economic conditions that facilitate disease emergence and transmission represents a substantial societal challenge. In the context of disease emergence from wildlife, wildlife and habitat should be conserved, which in turn will preserve vital ecosystem structure and function, which has broader implications for human wellbeing and environmental sustainability, while simultaneously minimizing the spillover of pathogens from wild animals into human beings. In this review, we propose a novel framework for the holistic and interdisciplinary investigation of zoonotic disease emergence and its drivers, using the spillover of bat pathogens as a case study. This study has been developed to gain a detailed interdisciplinary understanding, and it combines cutting-edge perspectives from both natural and social sciences, linked to policy impacts on public health, land use and conservation.","Wood, Leach, Waldman, Macgregor, Fooks, Jones, Restif, Dechmann, Hayman, Baker, Peel, Kamins, Fahr, Ntiamoa-Baidu, Suu-Ire, Breiman, Epstein, Field, Cunningham","https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2012.0228","20130115","Animal Migration; Animals; Chiroptera; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Disease Vectors; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; Feeding Behavior; Global Health; Humans; Population Dynamics; RNA Viruses; Zoonoses","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Simultaneous treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells with serine and cysteine protease inhibitors prevents severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus entry","The type II transmembrane protease TMPRSS2 activates the spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) on the cell surface following receptor binding during viral entry into cells. In the absence of TMPRSS2, SARS-CoV achieves cell entry via an endosomal pathway in which cathepsin L may play an important role, i.e., the activation of spike protein fusogenicity. This study shows that a commercial serine protease inhibitor (camostat) partially blocked infection by SARS-CoV and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) in HeLa cells expressing the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and TMPRSS2. Simultaneous treatment of the cells with camostat and EST [(23,25)trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamindo-3-methylbutane ethyl ester], a cathepsin inhibitor, efficiently prevented both cell entry and the multistep growth of SARS-CoV in human Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. This efficient inhibition could be attributed to the dual blockade of entry from the cell surface and through the endosomal pathway. These observations suggest camostat as a candidate antiviral drug to prevent or depress TMPRSS2-dependent infection by SARS-CoV.","Kawase, Shirato, van der Hoek, Taguchi, Matsuyama","https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.00094-12","20120809","Bronchi; Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors; Down-Regulation; Epithelial Cells; Humans; SARS Virus; Serine Proteinase Inhibitors; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Virus Internalization","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The coronavirus endoribonuclease Nsp15 interacts with retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein","Coronaviruses encode an endoribonuclease, Nsp15, which has a poorly defined role in infection. Sequence analysis revealed a retinoblastoma protein-binding motif (LXCXE/D) in the majority of the Nsp15 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and its orthologs in the alpha and beta coronaviruses. The endoribonuclease activity of the SARS-CoV Nsp15 (sNsp15) was stimulated by retinoblastoma protein (pRb) in vitro, and the two proteins can be coimmunoprecipitated from cellular extracts. Mutations in the pRb-binding motif rendered sNsp15 to be differentially modified by ubiquitin in cells, and cytotoxicity was observed upon its expression. Expression of the sNsp15 in cells resulted in an increased abundance of pRb in the cytoplasm, decreased overall levels of pRb, an increased proportion of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle, and an enhanced expression from a promoter normally repressed by pRb. The endoribonuclease activity of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 Nsp15 was also increased by pRb in vitro, and an MHV with mutations in the LXCXE/D-motif, named vLC, exhibited a smaller plaque diameter and reduced the virus titer by âˆ¼1 log. Overexpression of pRb delayed the viral protein production by wild-type MHV but not by vLC. This study reveals that pRb and its interaction with Nsp15 can affect coronavirus infection and adds coronaviruses to a small but growing family of RNA viruses that encode a protein to interact with pRb.","Bhardwaj, Liu, Leibowitz, Kao","https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.07012-11","20120618","Amino Acid Motifs; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Apoptosis; Binding Sites; Cell Line; Coronavirus Infections; Cricetinae; Endoribonucleases; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mice; Models, Molecular; Murine hepatitis virus; Mutation; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Protein Transport; Retinoblastoma Protein; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The role of type-2 turkey astrovirus in poult enteritis syndrome","An experimental study was conducted to determine the comparative pathogenicity of type-2 turkey astrovirus (TAstV-2) obtained from turkey flocks afflicted with poult enteritis syndrome (PES) and from turkey flocks displaying no apparent signs of infection. In total, ninety 7-d-old poults, which tested negative for the presence of astrovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, and reovirus by reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR , were divided evenly into 3 groups: A, B, and C. Birds in group A were inoculated orally with turkey astrovirus-positive intestinal contents from birds affected with PES. Group B received turkey astrovirus-containing intestinal contents from apparently healthy flocks. Group C served as a negative control and was given PBS. Clinical signs of diarrhea, depression, and dullness were observed in group A. Birds in group B also showed clinical signs similar to those in group A, although the signs were milder in nature. Birds in group C did not show any clinical signs. At 16 d postinoculation, the BW of birds in group A was significantly lower than that of birds in groups B or C. In addition, the bursa size was reduced in group A, but not in groups B or C. Birds in groups A and B, but not in group C, were found to shed turkey astrovirus in their feces, as detected by RT-PCR. These results provide a preliminary indication that TAstV-2 from PES birds may be more pathogenic than TAstV-2 from apparently healthy poults. Further studies are needed to determine if pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains of TAstV-2 exist in the environment. These results also reinforce our previous observations that astrovirus is involved in PES, causing significant retardation in growth and weight gain.","Mor, Abin, Costa, Durrani, Jindal, Goyal, Patnayak","https://doi.org/10.3382/ps.2011-01617","20120202","Animals; Astroviridae Infections; Avastrovirus; Enteritis; Gastrointestinal Contents; Poultry Diseases; Turkeys; Virus Shedding; Weight Gain","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Inbreeding depression increases susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis in lions: an experimental test using an inbred-outbred contrast through translocation","Disease can dramatically influence the dynamics of endangered wildlife populations, especially when they are small and isolated, with increased risk of inbreeding. In Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (HiP), a small, enclosed reserve in South Africa, a large lion (Panthera leo) population arose from a small founder group in the 1960s and started showing conspicuous signs of inbreeding. To restore the health status of the HiP lion population, outbred lions were translocated into the existing population. In this study, we determined the susceptibility to bovine tuberculosis (bTB), and the prevalence of antibody to feline viruses of native lions, and compared the findings with those from translocated outbred lions and their offspring. Antibodies to feline herpesvirus, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, and feline coronavirus were present in the lion population, but there was no significant difference in antibody prevalence between native and translocated lions and their offspring, and these feline viruses did not appear to have an effect on the clinical health of HiP lions. However, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), which was previously absent from HiP, appears to have been introduced into the lion population through translocation. Within 7 yr, the prevalence of antibody to FIV increased up to 42%. Bovine tuberculosis posed a major threat to the inbred native lion population, but not to translocated lions and their offspring. More than 30% of the native lion population died from bTB or malnutrition compared with &lt;2% of the translocated lions and their offspring. We have demonstrated that management of population genetics through supplementation can successfully combat a disease that threatens population persistence. However, great care must be taken not to introduce new diseases into populations through translocation.","Trinkel, Cooper, Packer, Slotow","https://doi.org/10.7589/0090-3558-47.3.494","20110915","Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Genetics, Population; Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline; Inbreeding; Lentivirus Infections; Lions; Male; Transportation; Tuberculosis","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Cutting edge: attrition of Plasmodium-specific memory CD8 T cells results in decreased protection that is rescued by booster immunization","Sterile protection against infection with Plasmodium sporozoites requires high numbers of memory CD8 T cells. However, infections with unrelated pathogens, as may occur in areas endemic to malaria, can dramatically decrease pre-existing memory CD8 T cells. It remains unknown whether unrelated infections will compromise numbers of Plasmodium-specific memory CD8 T cells and thus limit the duration of antimalarial immunity generated by subunit vaccination. We show that P. berghei circumsporozoite-specific memory CD8 T cells underwent significant attrition in numbers in mice subjected to unrelated infections. Attrition was associated with preferential loss of effector memory CD8 T cells and reduced immunity to P. berghei sporozoite challenge. However, and of relevance to deployment of Plasmodium vaccines in areas endemic to malaria, attrition of memory CD8 T cells was reversed by booster immunization, which restored protection. These data suggest that regular booster immunizations may be required to sustain protective vaccine-induced Plasmodium-specific memory CD8 T cells in the face of attrition caused by unrelated infections.","Schmidt, Harty","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.1003949","20110616","Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Coronavirus Infections; Dendritic Cells; Immunity, Innate; Immunization, Secondary; Immunologic Memory; Listeriosis; Lymphocyte Depletion; Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis; Malaria; Malaria Vaccines; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Plasmodium berghei; Protozoan Proteins; Vaccinia","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Association of seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses with history of mood disorders and suicide attempts","Anecdotal reports of mood disorder following infection with common respiratory viruses with neurotropic potential have been in existence since the last century. Nevertheless, systematic studies on the association between these viruses and mood disorders are lacking. Influenza A, B and coronavirus antibody titers were measured in 257 subjects with recurrent unipolar and bipolar disorder and healthy controls, by SCID. Pearson's Ï‡Â² tests and logistic regression models were used to analyze associations between seropositivity for coronaviruses, influenza A and B viruses and the following: a) history of recurrent mood disorders b) having attempted suicide in the past c) uni- vs. bi-polarity and d) presence of psychotic symptoms during mood episodes. Seropositivity for influenza A (p=0.004), B (p&lt;0.0001) and coronaviruses (p&lt;0.0001) were associated with history of mood disorders but not with the specific diagnosis of unipolar or bipolar depression. Seropositivity for influenza B was significantly associated with a history of suicide attempt (p=0.001) and history of psychotic symptoms (p=0.005). The design was cross-sectional. Socioeconomic factors, inflammatory markers, and axis II psychopathology were not assessed. The association of seropositivity for influenza and coronaviruses with a history of mood disorders, and influenza B with suicidal behavior require replication in larger longitudinal samples.

"Epidemiology of canine parvovirus and coronavirus in dogs presented with severe diarrhoea to PDSA PetAid hospitals","Canine parvovirus (CPV) and canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) are often cited as causes of diarrhoea in dogs. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of CPV and CECoV in dogs presenting with severe diarrhoea to PDSA PetAid hospitals throughout the UK. A total of 355 samples were collected from the PDSA between 2006 and 2008. All samples were tested for CPV using a long range PCR and for CECoV using RT-PCR. The prevalence of CPV was 58 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 52 to 63 per cent), with some evidence for regional variation. The prevalence of CECoV was 7.9 per cent (95 per cent CI 5.1 to 10.7 per cent). Analysis showed that animals with no history of vaccination were more likely to be CPV positive, with greatest effect in younger animals. CPV-positive animals were more likely to present with depression/lethargy than CPV-negative cases. The volume of diarrhoea and the presence of haemorrhage did not appear to be associated with the likelihood of detecting CPV. This study shows that CPV is a common finding in dogs presenting to PDSA hospitals with severe diarrhoea, and that CECoV is a less common but still potentially important pathogen. It also confirms that young and unvaccinated animals appear to be more at risk of presenting with CPV.","Godsall, Clegg, Stavisky, Radford, Pinchbeck","https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.c3095","20100927","Animals; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus, Canine; DNA, Viral; Diarrhea; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Hospitals, Animal; Male; Parvoviridae Infections; Parvovirus, Canine; Prevalence; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; United Kingdom","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Achieving a golden mean: mechanisms by which coronaviruses ensure synthesis of the correct stoichiometric ratios of viral proteins","In retroviruses and the double-stranded RNA totiviruses, the efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is critical for ensuring the proper ratios of upstream-encoded capsid proteins to downstream-encoded replicase enzymes. The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent downstream open reading frames encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and downstream open reading frames affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the -1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by &gt;4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a &quot;golden mean&quot; model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins.","Plant, Rakauskaite, Taylor, Dinman","https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.02480-09","20100421","Animals; Frameshifting, Ribosomal; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Models, Molecular; Murine hepatitis virus; Mutation; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Open Reading Frames; Protein Biosynthesis; RNA, Viral; SARS Virus; Viral Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Detection and molecular characterization of gene 3 and 5 of turkey coronavirus from turkeys with severe enteritis in Brazil","Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) is a causative agent associated with poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS) in turkeys worldwide. The disease is an acute, highly contagious enteric disease that is characterized by depression, anorexia, diarrhea, and high mortality in commercial turkey flocks. The presence of TCoV in 12 intestinal-content samples, from turkey flocks aged between 10 and 104 days and exhibiting severe enteritis, was monitored during the period of 2004 to 2006. TCoV detection was accomplished by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) through amplification of the 3' UTR region, followed by amplification of genes 3 and 5. Molecular characterization of the viruses was done through amplification of genes 3 and 5 and showed evidence of genetic similarity between them, although they differed from sequences of other TCoVs described in the literature. In relation to gene 3, samples showed a greater relationship with chicken infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), while gene 5 showed greater identity with pheasant coronavirus (PhCoV). Our results suggest that the strategy of amplification of the 3' UTR region, followed by sequencing of genes 3 and 5, has proven to be an effective means of detecting TCoV in intestinal contents.","Bunger, ChacÃ³n, Jones, Ferreira","https://doi.org/10.1637/8507-103108-Reg.1","20091110","Animals; Brazil; Coronavirus, Turkey; DNA, Viral; Disease Outbreaks; Enteritis, Transmissible, of Turkeys; Gene Expression Regulation, Viral; Genes, Viral; Phylogeny; Turkeys","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Here we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV M(pro), the active-site cysteine of which has been acylated by benzotriazole esters that act as suicide inhibitors. In one of the structures, the thioester product has been hydrolyzed and benzoic acid is observed to bind to the hydrophobic S2 pocket. This structure also features the enzyme with a shortened N-terminal segment (&quot;amputated N finger&quot;). The results further the understanding of the important role of the N finger for catalysis as well as the design of benzotriazole inhibitors with improved specificity.","Verschueren, Pumpor, AnemÃ¼ller, Chen, Mesters, Hilgenfeld","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chembiol.2008.04.011","20080903","Catalysis; Crystallization; Crystallography, X-Ray; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Esters; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Molecular Structure; Protease Inhibitors; Triazoles; Viral Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Structural and functional analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus endoribonuclease Nsp15","The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus encodes several RNA-processing enzymes that are unusual for RNA viruses, including Nsp15 (nonstructural protein 15), a hexameric endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves 3' of uridines. We solved the structure of a catalytically inactive mutant version of Nsp15, which was crystallized as a hexamer. The structure contains unreported flexibility in the active site of each subunit. Substitutions in the active site residues serine 293 and proline 343 allowed Nsp15 to cleave at cytidylate, whereas mutation of leucine 345 rendered Nsp15 able to cleave at purines as well as pyrimidines. Mutations that targeted the residues involved in subunit interactions generally resulted in the formation of catalytically inactive monomers. The RNA-binding residues were mapped by a method linking reversible cross-linking, RNA affinity purification, and peptide fingerprinting. Alanine substitution of several residues in the RNA-contacting portion of Nsp15 did not affect hexamer formation but decreased the affinity of RNA binding and reduced endonuclease activity. This suggests a model for Nsp15 hexamer interaction with RNA.","Bhardwaj, Palaninathan, Alcantara, Yi, Guarino, Sacchettini, Kao","https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M708375200","20080331","Amino Acid Sequence; Binding Sites; Catalysis; Crystallography, X-Ray; Leucine; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Pyrimidines; RNA Replicase; SARS Virus; Serine; Substrate Specificity; Viral Nonstructural Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Viral epizootic reveals inbreeding depression in a habitually inbreeding mammal","Inbreeding is typically detrimental to fitness. However, some animal populations are reported to inbreed without incurring inbreeding depression, ostensibly due to past &quot;purging&quot; of deleterious alleles. Challenging this is the position that purging can, at best, only adapt a population to a particular environment; novel selective regimes will always uncover additional inbreeding load. We consider this in a prominent test case: the eusocial naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber), one of the most inbred of all free-living mammals. We investigated factors affecting mortality in a population of naked mole-rats struck by a spontaneous, lethal coronavirus outbreak. In a multivariate model, inbreeding coefficient strongly predicted mortality, with closely inbred mole-rats (F&gt; or = 0.25) over 300% more likely to die than their outbred counterparts. We demonstrate that, contrary to common assertions, strong inbreeding depression is evident in this species. Our results suggest that loss of genetic diversity through inbreeding may render populations vulnerable to local extinction from emerging infectious diseases even when other inbreeding depression symptoms are absent.","Ross-Gillespie, O'Riain, Keller","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00177.x","20071113","Animals; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Inbreeding; Male; Mole Rats; Retrospective Studies","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Intratracheally administered pathogen-associated molecular patterns affect antibody responses of poultry","Various potential immune-modulating microbially derived pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), or so called homotopes, are present in high concentrations in the environment of food animals. In previous studies, intravenously administered PAMP had variable effects on specific primary and secondary immune responses of poultry to systemically administered antigens. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of intratracheal (i.t.) challenge with the PAMP lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and Zymosan-A (containing 1,3 beta-glucan) on primary and secondary (total) antibody (Ab) responses and (isotype) IgM, IgG, and IgA responses to systemically administered human serum albumin (HuSA), and Ab titers to infectious bursal disease (Gumboro virus) and infectious bronchitis vaccines in layer hens at 9 and 22 wk of age. Birds were challenged via the trachea with PAMP for 5 consecutive days prior to primary and secondary immunization with HuSA. Intratracheally administered LTA and, to a minor extent, lipopolysaccharide significantly enhanced secondary total and IgG Ab responses to HuSA. 1,3 beta-Glucan did not significantly affect Ab responses to HuSA. All birds challenged with PAMP showed a decreased BW. Higher total Ab titers to infectious bursal disease and infectious bronchitis were found in birds challenged with LTA. The present results indicate that i.t. administered PAMP affect the humoral immune responsiveness of poultry, which may lead to an enhanced status of immune reactivity. Furthermore, our results suggest that the hygienic status of the environment influences BW (gain). The consequences of immune modulation by airborne PAMP or hygienic conditions in chicken husbandry for vaccine delivery and immune responsiveness of poultry are discussed.","Ploegaert, De Vries Reilingh, Nieuwland, Lammers, Savelkoul, Parmentier","https://doi.org/10.1093/ps/86.8.1667","20070912","Animals; Birnaviridae Infections; Chickens; Coronavirus Infections; Female; Humans; Infectious bronchitis virus; Infectious bursal disease virus; Lipopolysaccharides; Serum Albumin; Teichoic Acids; Trachea; Viral Vaccines; Weight Gain; Zymosan","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Coronavirus associated with an enteric syndrome on a quail farm","An enteric syndrome was observed in quail (Coturnix coturnix) semi-intensively reared for restocking in Apulia (southern Italy). The birds showed depression, severe diarrhoea, dehydration and reduced growth. Mortality occurred particularly in young birds. At necropsy the prominent lesion was enteritis. A coronavirus was detected by electron microscopy and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in the faeces and in the intestinal content of the dead quails. The virus could not be cultivated in chicken embryos. By sequence analyses of a fragment (409 nucleotides) of region 1b of the polymerase gene, the quail coronavirus displayed &lt;or=93% nucleotide identity to avian coronaviruses (group 3 coronaviruses)--whereas by analysis of the S1 portion of the spike protein-encoding gene, the quail coronavirus displayed 16% to 18% amino acid identity with infectious bronchitis virus, and 79% to 81% identity with turkey coronavirus.

"Impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome care on the general health status of healthcare workers in taiwan","The impact of the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was enormous, but few studies have focused on the infectious and general health status of healthcare workers (HCWs) who treated patients with SARS. We prospectively evaluated the general health status of HCWs during the SARS epidemic. The Medical Outcome Study Short-Form 36 Survey was given to all HCWs immediately after caring for patients with SARS and 4 weeks after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts. Tests for detection of SARS coronavirus antibody were performed for HCWs at these 2 time points and for control subjects during the SARS epidemic. Tertiary care referral center in Taipei, Taiwan. Ninety SARS-care task force members (SARS HCWs) and 82 control subjects. All serum specimens tested negative for SARS antibody. Survey scores for SARS HCWs immediately after care were significantly lower than those for the control group (P&lt;.05 by the t test) in 6 categories. Vitality, social functioning, and mental health immediately after care and vitality and mental health after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts were among the worst subscales. The social functioning, role emotional, and role physical subscales significantly improved after self-quarantine and off-duty shifts (P&lt;.05, by paired t test). The length of contact time (mean number of contact-hours per day) with patients with SARS was associated with some subscales (role emotional, role physical, and mental health) to a mild extent. The total number of contact-hours with symptomatic patients with SARS was a borderline predictor (adjusted R2=0.069; P=.038) of mental health score. The impact of the SARS outbreak on SARS HCWs was significant in many dimensions of general health.

"Effects of humidity and other factors on the generation and sampling of a coronavirus aerosol","Suspensions of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a porcine coronavirus, were nebulized at rates of 0.1-0.2Â ml/min into moving air using a Collison nebulizer or a plastic medical nebulizer operating at pressures ranging from 7 to 15Â psi. The airborne viruses were collected on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters in an experimental apparatus and also sampled upstream of these test filters using AGI-30 and BioSampler impinger samplers. To study the effects of relative humidity (RH) on TGEV collection by the filters and samplers, the virus was nebulized into air at 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH. There were no significant changes in virus titer in the nebulizer suspension before and after nebulization for either nebulizer at any of the pressures utilized. Aerosolization efficiency - the ratio of viable virus sampled with impingers to the quantity of viable virus nebulized - decreased with increasing humidity. BioSamplers detected more airborne virus than AGI-30 samplers at all RH levels. This difference was statistically significant at 30 and 50% RH. Nebulizer type and pressure did not significantly affect the viability of the airborne virus. Virus recovery from test filters relative to the concentration of virus in the nebulizer suspension was less than 10%. The most and the least virus were recovered from filter media at 30% and 90% RH, respectively. The results suggest that TGEV, and perhaps other coronaviruses, remain viable longer in an airborne state and are sampled more effectively at low RH than at high humidity.","Kim, Ramakrishnan, Raynor, Goyal","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10453-007-9068-9","20200331","Bioaerosol; Coronavirus; Humidity; Nebulizer; Sampling; TGEV; Virus","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The effect of fostering on the genetic expression of locomotor sensitivity to alcohol","Steps were taken to eradicate endemic mouse coronavirus from a colony that was part of a behavioral project characterizing the genetics of alcohol sensitivity. This behavioral study was conducted to determine whether changing the uterine or rearing environment (as is integral to common rederivation methods) would have a significant effect on the expression of the behavioral traits in question. Selected breeding pairs of the affected lines were divided into four treatment groups: 1) transfer of embryos to pseudopregnant B6D2F1 female mice, 2) fostering offspring to B6D2F1 dams, 3) fostering offspring to a different dam of the same line, and 4) offspring raised by the birth dam. Embryo transfers were successful only in one affected line. At approximately 50 days of age, the offspring were tested for locomotor behavior after intraperitoneal administration of ethanol or normal saline. There were no statistically significant effects of embryo transfer on the ethanol phenotype (ethanol-induced locomotor depression). Fostering significantly reduced the stimulant response to ethanol of only one mouse line selectively bred for high sensitivity to ethanol-induced stimulation, although the stimulant response of the fostered groups was still quite robust. Overall, the results of this study showed that eradication efforts involving fostering of offspring have a modest impact on the stimulant response to ethanol, but there were insufficient data to draw conclusions regarding the use of embryo transfer.","Hickman, Burkhart-Kasch, Phillips","https://www.google.com/search?q=The+effect+of+fostering+on+the+genetic+expression+of+locomotor+sensitivity+to+alcohol.","20060314","Animals; Coronavirus; Embryo Transfer; Ethanol; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Motor Activity; Pregnancy","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Clinical pathology and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome]","To explore the pathological features and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) to provide evidence for the clinical treatment and prevention of SARS. Pathological features of 2 cases of full autopsy and 4 cases of needle biopsy tissue samples from the patients who died from SARS were studied by light and electron microscopy. The distribution and quantity of lymphocyte subpopulations in the lungs and immune organs from SARS patients were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The location and semi-quantitative analysis of SARS coronavirus in the tissue specimens were studied by electron microscopy, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. In total of 6 cases, diffuse alveolar damage and alveolar cell proliferation were common. The major pathological changes of 2 autopsy cases of SARS in lung tissues were acute pulmonary interstitial and alveolar exudative inflammation, and 2 autopsy and one biopsy lung tissues showed alveolar hyaline membrane formation. Terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamation of lung tissues in one autopsy and 2 biopsy cases were noted. Among 6 cases, 2 biopsy cases presented early pulmonary fibrosis and alveolar organization. Meanwhile, the immune organs, including lymph nodes and spleens from 2 autopsy cases of SARS whose disease courses were less than 12 days showed extensive hemorrhagic necrosis, reactive macrophage/histocyte proliferation, with relative depression of mononuclear and granulocytic clones in the bone marrows. However, spleen and bone marrow biopsy tissue samples from 4 dead SARS cases whose clinical course lasted from 21 to 40 days presented repairing changes. SARS coronaviruses were mainly identified in type I and II alveolar epithelia, macrophages, and endothelia; meanwhile, some renal tubular epithelial cells, cardiomyocytes, mucosal and crypt epithelial cells of gastrointestinal tracts, parenchymal cells in adrenal glands, lymphocytes, testicular epithelial cells and Leydig's cells were also detected by electron microscopy combined with in situ hybridization. The semi-quantitative analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations revealed that the proportion of CD8+ T lymphocytes were about 80% of the total infiltrative inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium, with a few CD4+ lymphocytes CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ or CD20+ lymphocyte subpopulations were obviously decreased and there was imbalance in number and proportion, while CD57+, CD68+, S-100+ and HLA-DR+ cells were relatively increased in lymph nodes and spleens. Histologically, the pulmonary changes could be divided into acute inflammatory exudative, terminal bronchiolar and alveolar desquamative and proliferative repair stages or types during the pathological process of SARS. SARS coronavirus was found in multi-target cells in vivo, which means that SARS coronavirus might cause multi-organ damages which were predominant in lungs. There were varying degrees of decrease and imbalance in number and proportion of lymphocyte subpopulations in the immune organs of the patients with SARS. However, these changes may be reversible. It was found that cellular immune responses were predominant in the lungs of SARS cases, which might play an important role in getting rid of coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune mediated injury.","Zhao, Zhou, Sun, Wang, Yang, Meng, Pan, Li, Zhou, Wang, Lu, Li, Wang, Zhou, Zhang","https://www.google.com/search?q=[Clinical+pathology+and+pathogenesis+of+severe+acute+respiratory+syndrome].","20090428","Aged; Female; Humans; Lung; Lymphocyte Subsets; Male; Middle Aged; SARS Virus; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Enhancement of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli pathogenicity in young turkeys by concurrent turkey coronavirus infection","In a previous study, turkey coronavirus (TCV) and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) were shown to synergistically interact in young turkeys coinfected with these agents. In that study, inapparent or mild disease was observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV or EPEC, whereas severe growth depression and high mortality were observed in dually inoculated turkeys. The purpose of the present study was to further evaluate the pathogenesis of combined TCV/EPEC infection in young turkeys and determine the role of these agents in the observed synergistic interaction. Experiments were conducted to determine 1) effect of EPEC dose, with and without concurrent TCV infection, and 2) effect of TCV exposure, before and after EPEC exposure, on development of clinical disease. Additionally, the effect of combined infection on TCV and EPEC shedding was determined. No clinical sign of disease and no attaching and effacing (AE) lesions characteristic of EPEC were observed in turkeys inoculated with only EPEC isolate R98/5, even when turkeys were inoculated with 10(10) colony forming units (CFU) EPEC (high dose exposure). Only mild growth depression was observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV; however, turkeys inoculated with both TCV and 10(4) CFU EPEC (low dose exposure) developed severe disease characterized by high mortality, marked growth depression, and AE lesions. Inoculation of turkeys with TCV 7 days prior to EPEC inoculation produced more severe disease (numerically greater mortality, significantly lower survival probability [P &lt; 0.05], increased frequency of AE lesions) than that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPEC prior to TCV or simultaneously inoculated with these agents. Coinfection of turkeys with TCV and EPEC resulted in significantly increased (P &lt; 0.05) shedding of EPEC, but not TCV, in intestinal contents of turkeys. These findings indicate that TCV infection predisposes young turkeys to secondary EPEC infection and potentiates the expression of EPEC pathogenicity in young turkeys.","Pakpinyo, Ley, Barnes, Vaillancourt, Guy","https://doi.org/10.1637/0005-2086(2003)047[0396:EOEECP]2.0.CO;2","20030905","Animals; Bacterial Adhesion; Coronavirus, Turkey; Enteritis, Transmissible, of Turkeys; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Feces; Intestines; Poultry Diseases; Turkeys","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Perforin-mediated effector function within the central nervous system requires IFN-gamma-mediated MHC up-regulation","CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the CNS control infection by the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus. Differential susceptibility of infected cell types to clearance by perforin or IFN-gamma uncovered distinct, nonredundant roles for these antiviral mechanisms. To separately evaluate each effector function specifically in the context of CD8(+) T cells, pathogenesis was analyzed in mice deficient in both perforin and IFN-gamma (PKO/GKO) or selectively reconstituted for each function by transfer of CD8(+) T cells. Untreated PKO/GKO mice were unable to control the infection and died of lethal encephalomyelitis within 16 days, despite substantially higher CD8(+) T cell accumulation in the CNS compared with controls. Uncontrolled infection was associated with limited MHC class I up-regulation and an absence of class II expression on microglia, coinciding with decreased CD4(+) T cells in CNS infiltrates. CD8(+) T cells from perforin-deficient and wild-type donors reduced virus replication in PKO/GKO recipients. By contrast, IFN-gamma-deficient donor CD8(+) T cells did not affect virus replication. The inability of perforin-mediated mechanisms to control virus in the absence of IFN-gamma coincided with reduced class I expression. These data not only confirm direct antiviral activity of IFN-gamma within the CNS but also demonstrate IFN-gamma-dependent MHC surface expression to guarantee local T cell effector function in tissues inherently low in MHC expression. The data further imply that IFN-gamma plays a crucial role in pathogenesis by regulating the balance between virus replication in oligodendrocytes, CD8(+) T cell effector function, and demyelination.","Bergmann, Parra, Hinton, Chandran, Morrison, Stohlman","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.170.6.3204","20030625","Acute Disease; Adoptive Transfer; Animals; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Central Nervous System Viral Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Encephalomyelitis; Histocompatibility Antigens Class I; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II; Interferon-gamma; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Murine hepatitis virus; Perforin; Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins; Up-Regulation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"In vivo thymulin treatments enhance avian lung natural killer cell cytotoxicity in response to infectious bronchitis virus","Previous work has shown that in vitro thymulin treatments have the ability to enhance natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. The purpose of the experiments presented here was to examine the in vivo effects of thymulin on avian NK cell activity in response to a viral infection. Five and a half-week-old K-strain chickens infected with avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) served as the model for these experiments. Daily thymulin injections began at varying time points prior to or post-infection. The controls received daily injections of the ZnCl(2)-containing carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) diluent. A 51Cr-cytolytic release assay was used to determine the activity of the NK cells harvested via lung lavage from the respiratory tracts of infected chickens. The results of these experiments showed that in vivo thymulin treatments enhance NK cytotoxicity. The greatest enhancement of NK cytotoxicity was observed at 10 days post-infection in those chickens that began receiving thymulin after infection. These results suggest that thymulin may not only have a role in enhancing immunosurveillance but also in enhancing the response of the innate immune system following infection. Dose-response experiments found that the 50 ng/100 g body weight (Bwt) dose significantly depressed the cytolytic activity of the NK cells in comparison to either the 10 ng/100 g Bwt dose or the control.","Oliver, Marsh","https://doi.org/10.1016/s1567-5769(02)00236-9","20030812","Animals; Chickens; Coronavirus Infections; Cytotoxicity, Immunologic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Infectious bronchitis virus; Killer Cells, Natural; Lung; Male; Thymic Factor, Circulating","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Failure to spread bovine virus diarrhoea virus infection from primarily infected calves despite concurrent infection with bovine coronavirus","Previous reports on the spread of bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) from animals primarily infected with the agent are contradictory. In this study, the possibility of transmission of BVDV from calves simultaneously subjected to acute BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCV) infection was investigated. Ten calves were inoculated intranasally with BVDV Type 1. Each of the 10 calves was then randomly allocated to one of two groups. In each group there were four additional calves, resulting in five infected and four susceptible calves per group. Virulent BCV was actively introduced in one of the groups by means of a transmitter calf. Two calves, susceptible to both BVDV and BCV, were kept in a separate group, as controls. All ten calves actively inoculated with BVDV became infected as shown by seroconversions, and six of them also shed the virus in nasal secretions. However, none of the other eight calves in the two groups (four in each) seroconverted to this agent. In contrast, it proved impossible to prevent the spread of BCV infection between the experimental groups and consequently all 20 study calves became infected with the virus. Following infection, BCV was detected in nasal secretions and in faeces of the calves and, after three weeks in the study, all had seroconverted to this virus. All calves, including the controls, showed at least one of the following clinical signs during days 3-15 after the trial started: fever (&gt; or =40 degrees C), depressed general condition, diarrhoea, and cough. The study showed that BVDV primarily infected cattle, even when co-infected with an enteric and respiratory pathogen, are inefficient transmitters of BVDV. This finding supports the principle of the Scandinavian BVDV control programmes that elimination of BVDV infection from cattle populations can be achieved by identifying and removing persistently infected (PI) animals, i.e. that long-term circulation of the virus without the presence of PI animals is highly unlikely.","Niskanen, Lindberg, TrÃ¥vÃ©n","https://doi.org/10.1053/tvjl.2001.0657","20020813","Acute Disease; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Bovine Virus Diarrhea-Mucosal Disease; Cattle; Comorbidity; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus, Bovine; Diarrhea Virus 1, Bovine Viral; Female; Male","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Embryonic exposure to lead: comparison of immune and cellular responses in unchallenged and virally stressed chickens","Lead, a ubiquitous environmental contaminant, has been shown to modulate various functions of the immune system and decrease host resistance to infectious disease. However, limited information is available concerning the direct effects of lead on the host immune response to an infectious agent after developmental exposure. The current study utilized chickens to examine the effect of embryonic lead exposure on immune and cellular responses during viral challenge. Sublethal doses of lead were introduced into fertilized Cornell K Strain White Leghorn chicken eggs via the air sac at day 5 or day 12 of embryonic development (designated as E5 and E12, respectively). Four-week-old female chickens were inoculated with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strain M41. Antibody titer to IBV, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response against bovine serum albumin (BSA), the absolute number and percentage of leukocyte subpopulations, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-like cytokine production by splenocytes were evaluated at 5-6 weeks of age. While antibody response to IBV in juvenile chicks was unaffected by the in ovo lead exposure, IFN-gamma-like cytokine production by splenocytes was significantly depressed following lead exposure at both developmental stages. In contrast with this pattern, the DTH response against BSA was unaffected following E5 exposure, but was significantly decreased after E12 exposure to lead. These changes were similar to those previously reported in chickens not exposed to IBV. While lead exposure at E5 induced significant changes in the percentage of circulating heterophils at 1 day postinfection (dpi), lead did not cause any change in relative leukocyte counts after E12 exposure. At 7 dpi, E5 lead exposure resulted in decreased absolute number and percentage of circulating lymphocytes, while total leukocyte counts, and the absolute number and percentage of circulating monocytes and heterophils were significantly reduced in E12 lead-exposed chickens. These results suggest that low-level exposure to lead has a direct effect on the developing chicken immune system, which is evident even during a postnatal infection. Furthermore, some of the changes were observed only when chicks were stressed by the viral infection. It appears that lead exposure during different stages of embryonic development is likely to result in different immunotoxic outcomes in juveniles.","Lee, Naqi, Kao, Dietert","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00204-001-0283-9","20020813","Animals; Antibody Formation; Cattle; Chick Embryo; Coronavirus Infections; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Hypersensitivity, Delayed; Immune System; Immunity, Cellular; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Infectious bronchitis virus; Interferon-gamma; Lead; Leukocyte Count; Poultry Diseases; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Spleen","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We showed previously that adoptive transfer of MHV-immune splenocytes depleted of either CD4 or CD8 T cells to infected RAG1(-/-) recipients (mice deficient in recombination activation gene 1) resulted in demyelination. Herein we show that transfer of CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes from MHV-immune IFN-gamma(-/-) donors resulted in a substantial decrease in demyelination (4.8% of the white matter of the spinal cord compared with 26.3% in those receiving cells from C57BL/6 donors). Similar numbers of lymphocytes were present in the CNS of recipients of either C57BL/6 or IFN-gamma(-/-) CD8 T cells, suggesting that IFN-gamma was not crucial for lymphocyte entry into the CNS.

All experimental cattle shed faecal BCV with development of diarrhoea, being profusely watery with small amounts of blood in the most severely affected animals, including both cows and calves. The cows, in contrast to the calves, showed depressed general condition and appetite leading to a marked decrease in milk yield. Further age-associated differences were a shorter incubation period in the two youngest calves, but with milder fever and milder decrease in white blood cell counts. These findings shed light on the apparent epidemiological differences between WD and calf BCV diarrhoea suggesting that, (1) the same strains of BCV cause natural outbreaks of calf diarrhoea and WD, (2) seronegative cows are more severely affected by the infection than seronegative conventionally reared calves, and (3) unaffected general condition in diarrhoeic calves may lead to underestimation of the occurrence of calf diarrhoea in WD outbreaks. In response to infection, all cattle produced early interferon type 1 in serum and, except for one calf, in nasal secretions. A finding not previously reported is the detection of interferon type 1 responses in bovine milk. All cattle developed high IgM antibody responses and long-lasting IgA antibody responses both systemically and locally. The serum IgM antibody responses came earlier in most of the calves than in the cows. Prolonged IgM antibody responses were detected in serum and milk, while those in nasal secretions were much shorter. BCV-specific IgA was present in nasal secretions from all cattle throughout the 6 months follow-up. The IgA antibody response in serum was detected up to 17 months post-infection and the duration showed an age-related variation indicating a more prominent IgA memory in the adult cattle and in the older calves than in the younger ones. BCV-specific IgG was detected in all cattle during the experimental period of up to 22 months. In conclusion, WD was reproduced in seronegative lactating cows. The cows showed a more severe general diseases than seronegative calves infected concurrently. Very long-lasting IgA antibody responses were detected both systemically and locally.","TrÃ¥vÃ©n, NÃ¤slund, Linde, Linde, SilvÃ¡n, Fossum, Hedlund, Larsson","https://doi.org/10.1016/s0378-1135(01)00337-6","20010719","Age Factors; Animals; Antibodies, Viral; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Coronavirus Infections; Coronavirus, Bovine; Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral; Dysentery; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Feces; Female; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin Isotypes; Interferon Type I; Lactation; Male; Milk; Nasal Mucosa; Seasons","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Host protein interactions with the 3' end of bovine coronavirus RNA and the requirement of the poly(A) tail for coronavirus defective genome replication","RNA viruses have 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that contain specific signals for RNA synthesis. The coronavirus genome is capped at the 5' end and has a 3' UTR that consists of 300 to 500 nucleotides (nt) plus a poly(A) tail. To further our understanding of coronavirus replication, we have begun to examine the involvement of host factors in this process for two group II viruses, bovine coronavirus (BCV) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV). Specific host protein interactions with the BCV 3' UTR [287 nt plus poly(A) tail] were identified using gel mobility shift assays. Competition with the MHV 3' UTR [301 nt plus poly(A) tail] suggests that the interactions are conserved for the two viruses. Proteins with molecular masses of 99, 95, and 73 kDa were detected in UV cross-linking experiments. Less heavily labeled proteins were also detected in the ranges of 40 to 50 and 30 kDa. The poly(A) tail was required for binding of the 73-kDa protein. Immunoprecipitation of UV-cross-linked proteins identified the 73-kDa protein as the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP). Replication of the defective genomes BCV Drep and MHV MIDI-C, along with several mutants, was used to determine the importance of the poly(A) tail. Defective genomes with shortened poly(A) tails consisting of 5 or 10 A residues were replicated after transfection into helper virus-infected cells. BCV Drep RNA that lacked a poly(A) tail did not replicate, whereas replication of MHV MIDI-C RNA with a deleted tail was detected after several virus passages. All mutants exhibited delayed kinetics of replication. Detectable extension or addition of the poly(A) tail to the mutants correlated with the appearance of these RNAs in the replication assay. RNAs with shortened poly(A) tails exhibited less in vitro PABP binding, suggesting that decreased interactions with the protein may affect RNA replication. The data strongly indicate that the poly(A) tail is an important cis-acting signal for coronavirus replication.","Spagnolo, Hogue","https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.74.11.5053-5065.2000","20000627","3' Untranslated Regions; Animals; Binding Sites; Cattle; Coronavirus, Bovine; Cross-Linking Reagents; DNA-Binding Proteins; Defective Viruses; Genes, Tumor Suppressor; Genome, Viral; Humans; L Cells; Mice; Murine hepatitis virus; Nuclear Proteins; Poly(A)-Binding Proteins; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Viral; RNA-Binding Proteins; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Protein p73; Tumor Suppressor Proteins; Ultraviolet Rays; Virus Replication","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"High mortality and growth depression experimentally produced in young turkeys by dual infection with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and turkey coronavirus","Six-day-old turkeys were inoculated with turkey coronavirus (TCV) and an enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) (isolate R98/5) that were isolated from poult enteritis and mortality syndrome (PEMS)-affected turkeys. Turkeys inoculated with only R98/5 did not develop clinically apparent disease, and only mild disease and moderate growth depression were observed in turkeys inoculated with only TCV. Turkeys dually inoculated with TCV and R98/5 developed severe enteritis with high mortality (38/48, 79%) and marked growth depression. R98/5 infection resulted in attaching/effacing (AE) intestinal lesions characteristic of EPEC: adherence of bacterial microcolonies to intestinal epithelium with degeneration and necrosis of epithelium at sites of bacterial attachment. AE lesions were more extensive and were detected for a prolonged duration in dually inoculated turkeys compared with turkeys inoculated with only R98/5. An apparent synergistic effect in dually inoculated turkeys was indicated by increased mortality, enhanced growth depression, and enhanced AE lesion development. The results suggest that TCV promoted intestinal colonization by R98/5; however, R98/5 did not appear to alter TCV infection. The present study provides a possible etiologic explanation for PEMS.","Guy, Smith, Breslin, Vaillancourt, Barnes","https://www.google.com/search?q=High+mortality+and+growth+depression+experimentally+produced+in+young+turkeys+by+dual+infection+with+enteropathogenic+Escherichia+coli+and+turkey+coronavirus.","20000616","Animals; Bacterial Adhesion; Enteritis, Transmissible, of Turkeys; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Growth Disorders; Poultry Diseases; Turkeys; Weight Gain","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis in interferon-gamma gene knockout mice naturally infected with mouse hepatitis virus","To investigate a disease outbreak in a colony of laboratory mice with targeted disruption of the gene for interferon-gamma. FORMAT: A case report based on necropsy, histopathology, serology and immunohistochemistry. Affected mice exhibited depression and variable ascites. Necropsy revealed a granulomatous peritonitis and pleuritis with extensive adhesions although parenchymal lesions were minimal. Serum samples had high concentrations of antibody to mouse hepatitis virus and immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of mouse hepatitis virus antigen in granuloma macrophages. Sero-logical testing for other infectious agents and bacterial culture were negative and wild type mice kept in the same facility remained healthy. Despite the association between the disease and mouse hepatitis virus infection, the precise role played by mouse hepatitis virus was not determined. While the disease is superficially similar to feline infectious peritonitis (another coronavirus-induced serositis), differences exist between the histopathological findings in these two conditions. This unusual disease process illustrates how new diagnostic challenges can arise in novel mouse genotypes created through molecular genetics. Furthermore, the association between the disease and mouse hepatitis virus illustrates the importance of maintaining laboratory animals under specific-pathogen free conditions.","France, Smith, Stevenson, Barthold","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1751-0813.1999.tb13199.x","19991130","Animals; Animals, Laboratory; Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, Viral; Ascitic Fluid; Colon; Coronavirus Infections; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Granuloma; Immunohistochemistry; Interferon-gamma; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Murine hepatitis virus; Peritonitis; Pleurisy; Rodent Diseases; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Virulence","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"ECG changes after rabbit coronavirus infection","This study examines the electrocardiographic (ECG) changes following rabbit coronavirus (RbCV) infection. We have shown that infection with RbCV results in the development of myocarditis and congestive heart failure and that some survivors of RbCV infection go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the chronic phase. Serial ECGs were recorded on 31 RbCV-infected rabbits. Measurements of heart rate; P-R interval; QRS duration; QTc interval; and P-, QRS-, and T-wave voltages were taken. The recordings were also examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. The acute and subacute phases were characterized by sinus tachycardia with depressed R- and T-wave voltages as well as disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. In most animals in the chronic phase, the sinus rate returned to near-baseline values with resolution of the QRS voltage changes. The ECG changes observed during RbCV infection are similar to the spectrum of interval/segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, conduction defects, and myocardial pathology seen in human myocarditis, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Because animals often died suddenly in the absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure during the acute phase, RbCV infection may increase ventricular vulnerability, resulting in sudden cardiac death. RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study sudden cardiac death in an animal model in which the ventricle is capable of supporting ventricular fibrillation, and invasive techniques monitoring cardiac function can be performed.","Alexander, Keene, Yount, Geratz, Small, Baric","https://doi.org/10.1016/s0022-0736(99)90018-3","19990419","Animals; Atrioventricular Node; Cardiomyopathy, Dilated; Coronavirus Infections; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Disease Models, Animal; Electrocardiography; Follow-Up Studies; Male; Myocarditis; Rabbits","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Changes in PBMC cytokine mRNA levels were detected by a reverse transcription, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-sqPCR), assessing IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNgamma. All of the kittens developed clinical signs typical of FIP, which were confirmed on gross post mortem examination. The recombinant proteins induced little or no specific antibody response prior to challenge, and failed to alter the course of disease compared to controls. One week after virus challenge, the stimulated PBMCs showed small increases in the expression of IL-6 and IFNgamma mRNA, which correlated with a transient pyrexia.

"A reliable, practical, and economical protocol for inducing diarrhea and severe dehydration in the neonatal calf","Fifteen healthy, colostrum-fed, male dairy calves, aged 2 to 7 d were used in a study to develop a diarrhea protocol for neonatal calves that is reliable, practical, and economical. After instrumentation and recording baseline data, diarrhea and dehydration were induced by administering milk replacer [16.5 mL/kg of body weight (BW), PO], sucrose (2 g/kg in a 20% aqueous solution, p.o.), spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide (1 mg/kg, PO) every 8 h, and furosemide (2 mg/kg, i.m., q6h). Calves were administered sucrose and diuretic agents for 48 h to induce diarrhea and severe dehydration. Clinical changes after 48 h were severe watery diarrhea, severe depression, and marked dehydration (mean, 14% BW loss). Cardiac output, stroke volume, mean central venous pressure, plasma volume, thiocyanate space, blood pH and bicarbonate concentration, base excess, serum chloride concentration, and fetlock temperature were decreased. Plasma lactate concentration, hematocrit, and serum potassium, creatinine, phosphorus, total protein and albumin concentrations were increased. This non-infectious calf diarrhea protocol has a 100% response rate, while providing a consistent and predictable hypovolemic state with diarrhea that reflects most of the clinicopathologic changes observed in osmotic/maldigestive diarrhea caused by infection with rotavirus, coronavirus or cryptosporidia. Limitations of the protocol, when compared to infectious diarrhea models, include failure to induce a severe metabolic acidosis, absence of hyponatremia, renal instead of enteric loss of chloride, renal as well as enteric loss of free water, absence of profound clinical depression and suspected differences in the morphologic and functional effect on intestinal epithelium. Despite these differences, the sucrose/diuretic protocol should be useful in the initial screening of new treatment modalities for calf diarrhea. To confirm their efficacy, the most effective treatment methods should then be examined in calves with naturally-acquired diarrhea.","Walker, Constable, Morin, Drackley, Foreman, Thurmon","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+reliable,+practical,+and+economical+protocol+for+inducing+diarrhea+and+severe+dehydration+in+the+neonatal+calf.","19981016","Animals; Animals, Newborn; Blood Glucose; Blood Proteins; Body Temperature; Body Weight; Cattle; Colostrum; Dehydration; Diarrhea; Electrolytes; Feces; Furosemide; Hemodynamics; Hydrochlorothiazide; Male; Spironolactone; Sucrose","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Effects of Newcastle disease vaccines and Newcastle disease/infectious bronchitis combination vaccines on the head-associated lymphoid tissues of the chicken","Ten Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and 10 NDV and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) combination vaccines (NDV/IBV) were evaluated for their effect on the head-associated lymphoid tissue (HALT) of 2-wk-old chicks. After vaccination, the chicks were subjected to an in vivo assay that measures the ability of the gland of Harder (GH) to respond to killed Brucella abortus antigen given in the eye by titering B. abortus antibodies in the tears. Following this, several sites in the HALT and trachea were examined histologically and scored for microscopic changes. The results indicated that three of the NDV/IBV combination vaccines (one BI/Mass&amp;Conn and two LaSota/Mass&amp;Conn) interfered with the GH response to killed B. abortus, whereas none of the NDV vaccines did Histologically, several changes were noted in the vaccinated chicks; however, no changes in the GH were observed that could explain microscopically the GH depression. With the IBV-only vaccines reported earlier (16), and the NDV-only and NDV/IBV combination vaccines reported here, a total of 36 vaccines have been evaluated using the same testing protocol.

"Isolation, pathogenicity, and H120 protection efficacy of infectious bronchitis viruses isolated in Taiwan","Seven isolates of infectious bronchitis (IB) virus (IBV) were isolated from two breeder farms and five broiler farms in Taiwan in 1992. The cardinal signs of disease in breeders were egg production drops and watery albumen, and those in broilers were respiratory distress and renal urate deposition or death. All diseased chickens had been vaccinated with IB vaccines (mostly H120). The viruses were isolated and identified by chicken embryo inoculation and electron microscopy. The genomes of the isolates were extracted and amplified by polymerase chain reaction; the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis suggested that the genotypes of the present IBV isolates were different from the eight reference strains. One-day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks were inoculated with the field isolates in order to test the virulence of those isolates. Respiratory distress and depression commenced at 24 hours after inoculation. Two of the seven isolates were found to be highly virulent, causing 50% or more mortality in inoculated chicks.

"Role of virus-specific CD4+ cytotoxic T cells in recovery from mouse hepatitis virus infection","Macrophages and T lymphocytes play an important role in recovery from viral infections. During mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) infection, a clear virus-specific class II-restricted cytotoxic T-cell response is generated. Transfer of these CD4+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) into naive mice protects against a lethal challenge with MHV. However, their in vivo antiviral effector mechanism is not yet clear. To further investigate a possible effector mechanism, we studied the effect of adoptive transfer of CD4+ CTL on virus localization in spleen and liver. We showed that adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cells does not affect localization of MHV-A59 in different macrophage subsets. Interestingly, a rapid and large infiltrate of CD4+ T cells in and around MHV-A59-infected foci in the liver was observed early in infection, whereas no CD8+ T cells were detectable. Moreover, transfer of virus-specific T cells resulted in significantly decreased viral titres in the liver and spleen and a marginally increased anti-MHV-A59 IgM production. These results imply an important role for virus-specific CD4+ CTL in elimination of infectious MHV-A59 and induction of an effective immune response in the absence of CD8+ CTL.","Wijburg, Heemskerk, Sanders, Boog, Van Rooijen","https://www.google.com/search?q=Role+of+virus-specific+CD4++cytotoxic+T+cells+in+recovery+from+mouse+hepatitis+virus+infection.","19960807","Animals; Antibodies, Viral; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Culture Techniques; Coronavirus Infections; Hepatitis, Viral, Animal; Immunotherapy, Adoptive; Liver; Lymphocyte Transfusion; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Murine hepatitis virus; Spleen; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Hepatitis mutants of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59","MHV-A59 causes acute meningoencephalitis and hepatitis in susceptible mice, and a persistent productive, but nonlytic, infection of cultured glial cells. We have shown previously that viruses isolated from persistently infected glial cell cultures have a fusion-defective phenotype and were impaired in their abilities to cause hepatitis compared to wild-type MHV-A59. Two mutants chosen for detailed study, B11 and C12, display two distinct hepatitis phenotypes. The ability of B11 to replicate in the liver was dependent on infectious dose and route of inoculation, while C12 consistently displayed decreased liver titers regardless of dose and route of inoculation. Sequence analysis of wild-type, mutant and revertant S proteins indicates that 1) a mutation in the N terminal subunit of S, resulting in a glutamine to leucine amino acid substitution (Q159L), may affect ability to cause hepatitis and 2) a cleavage site mutation (H716D) which determines fusogenicity is not responsible for the altered hepatitis phenotype. Sequence analysis indicated that hepatitis-producing revertants did not revert at mutation Q159L, although it is possible that a mutation in the heptad repeat domain of S2 may compensate for the mutation in S1. Since B11, C12 and a nonattenuated fusion mutant (B12) have identical S protein sequences, there must be additional mutations outside of S which influence both virulence and ability to replicate in the liver.","Hingley, Gombold, Lavi, Weiss","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-1899-0_92","19961016","Animals; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Genes, Viral; Hepatitis, Viral, Animal; Liver; Membrane Glycoproteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Murine hepatitis virus; Mutation; Spike Glycoprotein, Coronavirus; Viral Envelope Proteins; Virus Replication","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Efficacy of an inactivated vaccine against clinical disease caused by canine coronavirus","Canine Coronavirus (CCV) is a causative agent of diarrhea in dogs. The reproduction of severe clinical disease with experimental CCV infection has been difficult. We have recently developed a CCV challenge model which reproduced clinical signs of disease in susceptible dogs. The following study was designed to determine whether immunization with an inactivated CCV vaccine would protect dogs from clinical disease induced using this model. Dogs (n = 13) were vaccinated with an inactivated CCV vaccine. Vaccinates and controls (n = 5) were orally inoculated with virulent CCV virus and treated with dexamethasone on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 after virus challenge. Control dogs developed clinical signs including diarrhea, dehydration, anorexia, depression, and nasal and ocular discharge. Diarrhea was noted in 80% of the controls and 60% progressed to a severe watery or bloody diarrhea that persisted for multiple days. Conversely, only 2/13 (15%) vaccinates developed mild diarrhea and none developed bloody diarrhea. The control dogs averaged 10.8 days of diarrhea compared to 1.4 days for vaccinates over the 21 day observation period. In addition to reduced clinical signs, the number of days of virus shedding and the level of CCV in feces was different for controls (100% shed virus) and vaccinates (38% shed virus). This study demonstrates that vaccination with an inactivated CCV vaccine can significantly reduce not only viral replication, but the occurrence of clinical disease following a virulent CCV infection.","Fulker, Wasmoen, Atchison, Chu, Acree","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-1899-0_37","19961016","Animals; Coronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Diarrhea; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Female; Male; Time Factors; Vaccines, Inactivated; Viral Vaccines; Virus Shedding","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Specific T-cell response correlates with resistance of genetic heterogeneous mouse populations to mouse hepatitis virus 3 infection","In a recently published study [VassÃ£o RC, Mello IGC, Pereira CA (1994) Arch Virol 137: 277-288] we have shown that the genetically selected high antibody responder mice (HIII) are susceptible and the low antibody responder counterparts (LIII) are resistant to death induced by experimental infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3). This report shows that the MHV3 titers in the peritoneal exudate (PE) of HIII mice, 3 days after infection, were more than 2 log greater than in the resistant LIII mice, the interferon gamma (IFN gamma) titers in the PE of both mouse populations being not significantly different. The treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD4+ or CD8+ T cells induced susceptibility among LIII mice. The depletion of CD4+ T-cell subset in LIII mice was evidenced by, and led to a significant reduction in, the IFN gamma synthesis in their PEs with a 100 fold increase in MHV3 titers. When lymph node cells (LNC) were harvested from MHV3-infected mice and stimulated &quot;in vitro&quot; with MHV3 inactivated by ultraviolet radiation (uv-MHV3), only LNC from LIII mice were capable of proliferating and synthesizing significant amounts of interleukin 2 (IL-2). The LNC proliferation and IL-2 synthesis were inhibited by treatment with mAbs against CD4 or CD8 molecules. The MHV3 infection induced in both lines of mice a profound depression of the mitogenic response of LNC to phytohemaglutinin (PHA).

To determine the intestinal and systemic cellular immune status, we performed MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) assay on mesenteric lymphocytes, enumerated T cell subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and examined histopathological alterations in mesenteric lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Target cells for the CTL assay were autologous testicular cells and effector cells were mesenteric lymphocytes from calves infected with BCV. No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The TC/TS population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo. The mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of calves inoculated with the virulent virus showed severe depletion of lymphocytes.

"MHV-A59 fusion mutants are attenuated and display altered hepatotropism","Mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 causes a persistent productive, but nonlytic, infection of cultured glial cells. We have mutants isolated from persistently infected glial cell cultures which have been shown to be fusion-defective due to a histidine to aspartic acid mutation (H716D) near the cleavage site of the peplomer protein, S. Here, we examine the pathogenicity of these mutants and show differences in hepatotropism and virulence compared to wild-type virus (WT). Two mutants chosen for detailed study, B11 and C12, were impaired in their abilities to cause hepatitis and/or replicate in the liver of susceptible mice. Furthermore, B11 and C12 display two separate hepatotropic phenotypes. The ability of B11 to replicate in the liver was dependent on infectious dose and route of inoculation, while C12 consistently displayed decreased hepatotropism regardless of dose and route of inoculation. However, B11 and C12 were shown to replicate in the CNS of infected animals similarly to WT. Like WT, the mutants produced meningoencephalitis during acute infection, with viral antigen exhibiting a similar distribution in the brain, and demyelination during chronic infection. Sequence analysis of wild-type, mutant, and revertant S proteins indicates that (1) a mutation in the N terminal subunit of S (S1), resulting in a glutamine to leucine amino acid substitution (Q159L), may affect hepatotropism and (2) a cleavage site mutation which determines fusogenicity is not responsible for altered hepatotropism. Furthermore, since B11, C12, and a nonattenuated fusion mutant (B12) have identical S protein sequences, there must be additional mutations outside of S which influence both virulence and hepatotropism.","Hingley, Gombold, Lavi, Weiss","https://doi.org/10.1006/viro.1994.1156","19940414","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antigens, Viral; Brain; Coronavirus Infections; Demyelinating Diseases; Liver; Membrane Fusion; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Sequence Data; Murine hepatitis virus; Mutation; Neuroglia; Organ Specificity; Viral Proteins; Virulence","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Single amino acid changes in the viral glycoprotein M affect induction of alpha interferon by the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus","Transmissible gastroenteritis virus, an enteropathogenic coronavirus of swine, is a potent inducer of alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) both in vitro and in vivo. Previous studies have shown that virus-infected fixed cells or viral suspensions were able to induce an early and strong IFN-alpha synthesis by naive lymphocytes. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the viral membrane glycoprotein M (29,000; formerly E1) were found to markedly inhibit virus-induced IFN production, thus assigning to M protein a potential effector role in this phenomenon (B. Charley and H. Laude, J. Virol. 62:8-11, 1988). The present report describes the selection and characterization of a collection of 125 mutant viruses which escaped complement-mediated neutralization by two IFN induction-blocking anti-M protein monoclonal antibodies. Two of these mutants, designated H92 and dm49-4, were found to exhibit a markedly reduced interferogenic activity. IFN synthesis by lymphocytes incubated with purified suspensions of these mutants was 30- to 300-fold lower than that of the parental virus. The transcription of IFN-alpha genes following induction by each mutant was decreased proportionally, as evidenced by Northern (RNA) blot analysis. The sequence of the M gene of 20 complement-mediated neutralization-resistant mutants, including the 2 defective mutants, was determined by direct sequencing of genome RNA. Thirteen distinct amino acid changes were predicted, all located at positions 6 to 22 from the N terminus of the mature M protein and within the putative ectodomain of the molecule. Two substitutions, Thr-17 to Ile and Ser-19 to Pro, were assumed to generate the defective phenotypes of mutants dm49-4 and H92, respectively. The alteration of an Asn-Ser-Thr sequence in dm49-4 virus led to the synthesis of an M protein devoid of a glycan side chain, which suggests a possible involvement of this structure in IFN induction. Overall, these data supported the view that an interferogenic determinant resides in the N-terminal, exposed part of the molecule and provided further evidence for the direct role of M protein in the induction of IFN-alpha by transmissible gastroenteritis virus. The acronym VIP (viral interferogenic protein) is proposed as a designation for this particular class of proteins.","Laude, Gelfi, Lavenant, Charley","https://doi.org/10.1128/JVI.66.2.743-749.1992","19920214","Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Viral; Base Sequence; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Interferon Inducers; Interferon-alpha; Kidney; Kinetics; Lymphocytes; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Neutralization Tests; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; RNA, Viral; Swine; Testis; Transmissible gastroenteritis virus; Viral Matrix Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Responses of mice to murine coronavirus immunization","Oral and/or intranasal inoculation of susceptible mouse genotypes with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) consistently results in T cell dysfunction as reflected by in vitro proliferative responses to mitogens or allogeneic cells. One approach to examining the mechanism responsible for the observed functional T cell suppression is to determine whether virus replication is required for its induction. To this end, mice were inoculated oronasally with MHV-JHM that was inactivated with short-wave ultraviolet light, beta-propiolactone or psoralen. Mice were also inoculated with live MHV-JHM after recovery from homotypic or heterotypic MHV infection. Spleen cells from BALB mice inoculated oronasally with inactivated MHV-JHM yielded extremely variable in vitro proliferative responses after concanavalin A stimulation. MHV-susceptible mice exposed oronasally or intraperitoneally to virus inactivated by any of the minimum effective treatments failed to seroconvert. Immunization with psoralen-treated virus intraperitoneally in Freund's complete adjuvant or oronasally failed to protect from live virus challenge, but survivors had elevated virus-specific serum IgG antibody titers compared to mock-immunized controls at two weeks post-challenge. Spleen cells from mice that were challenged after recovery from homotypic live virus infection did not exhibit the profound in vitro T cell suppression normally observed during the acute stage of primary infection. In contrast, MHV-JHM challenge of mice vaccinated with heterotypic live MHV-S resulted in significantly depressed in vitro T cell function. The combined data suggest that either virus replication or exposure to more concentrated antigen may be required for induction of the dramatic T cell dysfunction that occurs as a consequence of MHV-JHM infection as well as for a detectable MHV-specific humoral response.","Smith, de Souza, Finzi, Barthold","https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01309627","19920901","Animals; Antigens, Viral; Female; Ficusin; Hepatitis, Viral, Animal; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Murine hepatitis virus; Propiolactone; Spleen; T-Lymphocytes; Ultraviolet Rays; Vaccination; Viral Vaccines; Virus Replication","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"[Feline immunodeficiency virus in Switzerland: clinical aspects and epidemiology in comparison with feline leukemia virus and coronaviruses]","Serum samples from 1421 domestic cats (561 healthy, 860 sick) were tested for FIV-, FeLV- and coronavirus infection. The results were stored in a computer data base and compared with epidemiologic data and clinical findings. All 3 infections were significantly more prevalent in sick than healthy cats: FIV was found in 0.7% of healthy and 3.4% of sick cats. For FeLV the prevalence was 3.0% and 13.0% and for coronavirus 21% and 36.2%, respectively. FIV-infected cats were mostly male (73%); no sex predilection was observed in FeLV- and coronavirus infection. In sick cats FIV-infection was significantly more prevalent in cats greater than 2 years of age; no age-dependence was found in FeLV- and coronavirus infections. The prevalence of FIV-infection increased significantly with the number of animals per household. In contrast, the frequency of FeLV infection decreased with the number of animals per household. Prevalence of coronavirus infection did not vary with group size or living conditions. The following clinical symptoms were associated with infection: FIV: general depression, diseases of the urinary tract; FeLV: general depression, fever, rough hair coat, lymphadenopathy, impaired functions of heart and circulation and muscle atrophy; coronavirus: lymphadenopathy and alterations in the abdomen.

"NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Benzyl Alcohol (CAS No 100-51-6) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies)","Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of technical-grade benzyl alcohol (99% pure), a textile dye additive, solvent, and food flavoring agent, were conducted by administering the chemical by gavage in corn oil vehicle to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Short-Term Studies: In 16-day studies, all five male and five female rats and mice dosed with 2,000 mg/kg benzyl alcohol died. Two of five male and 3/5 female rats and 1/5 male and 2/5 female mice dosed with 1,000 mg/kg died. Rats and mice of each sex in the two highest dose groups were lethargic after dosing. Other toxic responses to benzyl alcohol in these dose groups included blood around the mouth and nose, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and blood in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts of rats and blood in the urinary bladder of mice. Animals administered lower doses of benzyl alcohol (125, 250, or 500 mg/kg) had no compound-related histologic lesions. Doses selected for the 13-week studies were 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg for rats and mice. Eight of 10 male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg died during weeks 7 and 8; four of these deaths were described as gavage related. Rats dosed with 800 mg/kg exhibited clinical signs indicative of neurotoxicity including staggering, respiratory difficulty, and lethargy. Hemorrhages occurred around the mouth and nose, and there were histologic lesions in the brain, thymus, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In mice, deaths were scattered among all dose levels, but none occurred in vehicle controls. Four male and six female mice died after being dosed; all deaths but one were described as gavage related. Staggering after dosing also occurred during the first 2 weeks of the studies in mice dosed with 800 mg/kg. Some of the deaths in the rats and mice may have been caused by a combination of the gavage procedure and chemical toxicity, since there was evidence that benzyl alcohol induced neurotoxic effects. There were reductions in relative weight gain in male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg benzyl alcohol, in female rats dosed with 200 mg/kg or more, in male mice dosed with 400 or 800 mg/kg, and in female mice dosed with 200 mg/kg or more. No notable changes in body weight gain or compound-related histopathologic lesions were observed in rats or mice from the lower dose groups. Based on mortality, reduction in relative body weight gain, and the histopathologic lesions, doses selected for 2-year studies in rats were 0, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Doses selected for 2-year studies in mice were 0, 100, and 200 mg/kg, based on mortality and depression in relative body weight gain. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Fifty animals of each species and sex were administered benzyl alcohol in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Administration of benzyl alcohol did not affect survival in male rats (final survival rates: vehicle control, 28/50; low dose, 27/50; high dose, 24/50) but reduced survival of dosed female rats by half (36/50; 18/50; 17/50). Many of the early deaths were considered related to the gavage procedure. Survival in mice was not affected by benzyl alcohol administration (male: 34/50; 33/50; 35/50; female: 26/50; 32/50; 36/50). No effect of benzyl alcohol on body weight gain in rats or mice was observed. In the third month of the studies, clinical signs of sialodacryoadenitis virus infection were observed in rats. A positive serologic reaction for rat coronavirus was observed in sentinel animals at 6 months and again at 18 months. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: No apparent compound-related nonneoplastic responses were observed. Dose-related negative trends in the incidences of anterior pituitary gland neoplasms were seen in female rats (vehicle control, 29/50; low dose, 17/47; high dose, 9/49) and of harderian gland adenomas in male mice (8/50; 3/50; 2/50). Adenomas of the adrenal cortex occurred at an increased incidence in high dose male mice (0/48; 0/44; 3/48), but this slight increase was not considered to be related to chemical expcal exposure. Genetic Toxicology: Benzyl alcohol was not mutagenic when tested by the preincubational protocol in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537. In the mouse L5178Y/TK&amp;plusmn; lymphoma assay, benzyl alcohol induced an increase in trifluorothymidine (Tft)-resistant cells in the absence, but not in the presence, of S9; the effect was associated with toxicity. In cytogenetic assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, treatment with benzyl alcohol produced an increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) which was judged to be equivocal both with and without S9; a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after exposure to benzyl alcohol in the presence, but not the absence, of S9. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of benzyl alcohol have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female F344/N rats dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg. Survival in both dose groups of female rats was 50&amp;percnt; that of vehicle controls, primarily due to an increased number of gavage-related deaths. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female B6C3F1 mice dosed with 100 or 200 mg/kg for 2 years.

A sudden acute outbreak of fever, depression, anorexia and coughing in a group of nulliparous sows from a herd that was currently under epidemiological investigation lead to build a particular disposal of observation. The clinical signs were daily recorded including rectal temperature. Blood was taken from the sows at the beginning of the troubles and 3 weeks later for the detection of Aujesky's disease, coronavirus TGE-like, Influenza viruses A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae. Viral detection was attempted from nasal swabs and aborted fetuses during the acute phase. The clinical study showed fever reaching near 41 degrees C on most of the pigs and lasting usually from 2 to 5 days. The diagnosis of Influenza (virus swine H1N1) was established both on serology (massive seroconversion) and on the detection of the virus from the nasal swabs and from an aborted fetus. The control of the lungs of sows &quot;not in pig&quot; and culled showed extended lesions of bronchopneumonia and Pasteurella multocida was found. The technical consequences of this severe outbreak of Influenza on reproduction were mainly important at the beginning of pregnancy. Over 13 sows inseminated less than 1 week before the outbreak, only 3 farrowed (respectively 5.5 and 12 piglets); 7 returned to oestrus and 3 &quot;not a pig&quot; at 21 days (echotomography) did not show signs of heat and were culled.

"Attenuation of murine coronavirus infection by ammonium chloride","Ammonium chloride at a concentration of 20 mM delayed by 4-5 hr the production of virus progeny in mouse L-2 cells infected at high multiplicity with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). This delay was seen in the production of both intracellular and extracellular virus. However, the final titers were similar to those produced by MHV-infected cells maintained in normal medium. The manifestation of virus-induced cell fusion was similarly found to be delayed, but not otherwise decreased in severity, when ammonium chloride was present in the culture medium. Ammonium chloride caused similar delays in production of virus-specific, positive-sense RNAs and of viral polypeptides. The relative proportions and apparent molecular weights of viral RNAs and polypeptides were similar to those found in MHV-infected cells cultured in normal medium. In vitro translation of endogenously produced viral RNAs in cell extracts, prepared from MHV-infected cells, was not inhibited by ammonium chloride. Thus, ammonium chloride has no specific, inhibitory effect on viral protein synthesis. Ammonium chloride did not reduce the number of virus-infected cells in culture, as monitored by infectious center assay. Analysis of early events in MHV infection showed that ammonium chloride did not affect adsorption or internalization of MHV by L-2 cells. However, the subsequent eclipse phase, as monitored by decline in infectivity of internalized virus inoculum proceeded less efficiently in the presence of ammonium chloride. On the basis of the known inhibitory effects of ammonium chloride on lysosomal/endosomal functions, the results suggest an endosomal mechanism of MHV uncoating. Thus the primary effect of ammonium chloride on MHV infection of L-2 cells is to attenuate virus uncoating, thereby chronologically displacing all subsequent virus-encoded functions.","Mizzen, Hilton, Cheley, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1016/0042-6822(85)90345-9","19851211","Ammonium Chloride; Animals; Kinetics; L Cells; Mice; Murine hepatitis virus; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; RNA, Viral; Transcription, Genetic; Viral Proteins","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses.

We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>292) and Latin-America (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others.

"An analysis on the panic during COVID-19 pandemic through an online form","With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p = 0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p = 0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent regardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients. Lastly, spectrum of panic consequences due to COVID-19 pandemic were constructed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.046","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs and their relationship with perceived stress and pre-existing conspiracy beliefs","Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID–related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110201","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Changes in alcohol use as a function of psychological distress and social support following COVID-19 related University closings","Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30 days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Objective While it is well known that mental health problems are common consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCLC), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. Results It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. Conclusion These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131","20201015",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study","Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. Methods This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Results Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57–2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46–2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99–1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63–2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92–1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53–1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54–3.52) for mental problems. Limitations The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Conclusions Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients.

"Risk factors associated with mental illness in hospital discharged patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11–22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life in clinically stable patients with COVID-19","Introduction High risk of mental health problems is associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. Methods This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. Results A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, P<U+202F>=<U+202F>0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were independently associated with depression. Patients with depression had lower QOL than those without. Conclusion Depression is highly prevalent in clinically stable patients with COVID-19.

"An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in china during the outbreak of COVID-19","ABSTRACT Objective : The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . Methods : By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. Results : The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099–1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209–2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252–7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609–0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923–0.951). Conclusion : Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. Methods During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). Conclusion Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact.

Method To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Results Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms.

"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large cross-sectional study","Background : Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods : A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001).

The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p<0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p<0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom. Limitations This study adopted a cross-sectional design and used self-report questionnaires.

"The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter","Objective We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. Methods During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. Results Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034","20200915",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target","Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I h) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I h amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I h activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence. In whole-cell potential recordings, addition of PFD reduced the firing frequency, and this effect was accompanied by the depression in the amplitude of sag voltage elicited by hyperpolarizing current stimulus. Overall, this study highlights evidence that PFD is capable of perturbing specific ionic currents, revealing a potential additional impact on functional activities of different excitable cells.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2020.173237","20200905",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents’ individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown.

"The psychological and mental impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical staff and general public – A systematic review and meta-analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures.

"The effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity on mental health during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in Austria","Background The impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported for different countries. This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. Methods An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). Results In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off =10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off =10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off =15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia.

"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry","Background : The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. Methods : We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Case-centered recommendations : Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Limitations : Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Conclusions : Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","Background COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country.

We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th–April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). Results Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. Conclusions NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress.

"Maternal choline and respiratory coronavirus effects on fetal brain development: Prenatal coronavirus and choline fetal brain effects","Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6–16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants’ level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (=7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels =7.5 µM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Background Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity.

While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. Materials and methods An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Conclusion Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?","Introduction Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive peptides/proteins, immune molecules and inflammatory mediators which are known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. Objective Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. Methodology We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. Conclusion More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation","Background Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.081","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19","Background Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. Methods Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Results Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children’s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. Conclusion For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The proteasome as a druggable target with multiple therapeutic potentialities: Cutting and non-cutting edges","Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an adaptable and finely tuned system that sustains proteostasis network under a large variety of physiopathological conditions. Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

An online survey was conducted from 1 May to 8 May 2020 to collect the information. A structural questionnaire link using ‘Google form’ was sent to students’ through WhatsApp and E-mail. A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic.

"University students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece","The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths.

"Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbances, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The evaluation of sleep disturbances for Chinese frontline medical workers under the outbreak of COVID-19","Objective To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (FMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and make a comparison with non-FMW. Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 ± 3.8 vs 7.5 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 ± 4.3 vs 5.3 ± 3.8; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 ± 2.7 vs 4.3 ± 2.6; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22) and depression (4.1 ± 2.5 vs 3.6 ± 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR] = 1.29; P < 0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR = 1.45; P < 0.001).

"Projected increases in suicide in Canada as a consequence of COVID-19","Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide. We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority.

"COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world. In conclusion, subsyndromal mental health problems are a common response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece Comparison between 2019 and 2020","In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70–79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators","The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in different countries around the world. Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.” Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Media use and acute psychological outcomes during COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 outbreak in China led to an extraordinary threat to public health and wellbeing. This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Protocol for a partially nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the scleroderma patient-centered intervention network COVID-19 home-isolation activities together (SPIN-CHAT) program to reduce anxiety among at-risk scleroderma patients","Objective Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. Methods The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score<U+202F>=<U+202F>55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. Ethics and dissemination The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110132","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Incremental validity of coronaphobia: Coronavirus anxiety explains depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety","The adverse psychological effects of COVID-19 have increased globally. Moreover, the psychological toll may be worsening for this health crisis due to the growing numbers of mass deaths and unemployment levels. Coronaphobia, a relatively new pandemic-related construct, has been shown to be strongly related to functional impairment and psychological distress. However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Overdose and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019","Background There have been significant efforts to respond to the two public health emergencies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and overdose in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015–2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Psychometric characteristics, reliability and validity in the Israeli population","Mental health clinicians worldwide have been expressing concerns regarding the broad psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia.

"Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance","As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and “staying at home” to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

"Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review","Background and aims COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its’ associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. Methods An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country. Conclusions Considering the present findings, it is essential to introduce time-oriented policy, and implement care monitoring plans in the country, which may help in managing the pandemic as well as nurturing the public mental health to combat COVID-19 related psychological challenges.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04399","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Navigating crisis from the backseat? How top managers can support radical change initiatives by middle managers","We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW.

"A qualitative study on the psychological experience of caregivers of COVID-19 patients","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff. Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese public during the outbreak, and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 7,236 self-selected volunteers assessed with demographic information, COVID-19 related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depressive symptoms, and sleep quality. The overall prevalence of GAD, depressive symptoms, and sleep quality of the public were 35.1%, 20.1%, and 18.2%, respectively. Younger people reported a significantly higher prevalence of GAD and depressive symptoms than older people. Compared with other occupational group, healthcare workers were more likely to have poor sleep quality. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age (< 35 years) and time spent focusing on the COVID-19 (= 3 hours per day) were associated with GAD, and healthcare workers were at high risk for poor sleep quality. Our study identified a major mental health burden of the public during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"People experiencing homelessness: Their potential exposure to COVID-19","Background Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS). A total of N = 908 Chinese adults (mean age = 40.37 years, SD = 9.27; n = 752 female) participated in a survey distributed between February 24 and March 15, 2020. Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19. These results lend support for individual variation in the activation of the BIS.

The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated Psychological Problems","The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China. Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A cross-sectional study on mental health among health care workers during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019","The spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global major public health event, threatening people's physical and mental health and even life safety. This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). <U+03C7>2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A crisis within the crisis: The mental health situation of refugees in the world during the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Background 68.5 million people around the world have been forced to leave their houses. Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. Method The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection.

"When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak","Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic. Intensive care unit physicians are on their stress limit, especially when dealing with older patients and with death prospects. Doctors, not a relative, are inevitably the last people a dying COVID-19 patient will see.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112972","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review","Objective The lack of resources and coordination to face the coronavirus epidemic raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we still have memories of the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims to propose guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemic in France. Methods The authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and in local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities among patients with mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found among patients with mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which are risk factors for severe covid-19 infection; (2) age (the elderly form the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioural disorders, which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability as a result of stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly suited to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortages of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds have been closed, wards have high densities of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, and medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. There are also major issues when referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain the continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of “COVID+ units”. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants are placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nursing staff receives specific training, daily medical check-ups and close psychological support. Family visits are prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management are organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support patients when they get back home and to help them cope with the experience of confinement, which is liable to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of community mental health facilities is particularly disturbing for patients, but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of suicide risk and psycho-education strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private practice psychiatrists also have a crucial role of information towards their patients on confinement and barrier measures, and also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent in confinement: maintenance of regular sleep r, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

"Demographics and self-reported well-being of Brazilian adults as a function of pet ownership: A pilot study","The goals of the present study were to investigate socio-demographic characteristics and well-being indicators associated with pet ownership. The respondents (N = 801, 53.8% females; 56.2% with children) came from the five macro-regions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18% South, 10% Central-West). Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our findings and new research directions are discussed. Our study was conducted before the Covid-19 pandemic. The survey should be reapplied during and after the pandemic, so that we can deepen our knowledge of the socio-demographic characteristics and subjective well-being indicators associated with pet ownership.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04069","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study","Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166","20200501",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Provision of Emergency Maxillofacial Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Collaborative Five Centre UK Study","The global pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents one of the greatest challenges to healthcare systems, and has forced medical specialties to rapidly adapt their approaches to patient care. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is considered particularly at risk of disease transmission due to aerosol generation during surgical interventions, patient proximity and operating environment. On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home. There were 44 cases of facial fractures with a tendency for conservative treatment. 19 cases were related to domestic violence or self-harm. Of the 216 dental related emergencies, 68% could have been managed in the primary care setting. A quarter of all emergency patients were satisfactorily managed by remote consultations. There was a significant change in the provision of emergency maxillofacial service during the pandemic lockdown. We discuss the study findings as well as the potential implications in relation to planning for possible further COVID- 19 spikes and future pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.05.020","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives","Résumé Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Abstract Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In this critical scenario, lung cancer patients scheduled for surgical treatment need to continue to receive optimal care while protecting them from an eventual severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Adequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) and a COVID-19 specific intraoperative management are paramount in order to prevent cross infections.

"Reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical perspectives from a case series","Introduction The world is currently undergoing an extremely stressful scenario due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This unexpected and dramatic situation could increase the incidence of mental health problems, among them, psychotic disorders. The aim of this paper was to describe a case series of brief reactive psychosis due to the psychological distress from the current coronavirus pandemic. Materials and methods We report on a case series including all the patients with reactive psychoses in the context of the COVID-19 crisis who were admitted to the Virgen del Rocío and Virgen Macarena University Hospitals (Seville, Spain) during the first two weeks of compulsory nationwide quarantine. Results In that short period, four patients met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for a brief reactive psychotic disorder. All of the episodes were directly triggered by stress derived from the COVID-19 pandemic and half of the patients presented severe suicidal behavior at admission. Conclusions We may now be witnessing an increasing number of brief reactive psychotic disorders as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This type of psychosis has a high risk of suicidal behavior and, although short-lived, has a high rate of psychotic recurrence and low diagnostic stability over time. Therefore, we advocate close monitoring in both the acute phase and long-term follow-up of these patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.04.009","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study","The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Minimal Access Gardening: Laparoscopic Techniques during Coronavirus Disease Lockdown","ABSTRACT Objective To demonstrate techniques of laparoscopic surgery while all elective procedures are suspended. Design Stepwise demonstration of key skills required when gardening with minimal access techniques. Setting Gynecologist residence in self-isolation, Manchester, United Kingdom. Interventions Owing to the coronavirus disease pandemic, elective operations are currently suspended in the United Kingdom. In addition, there have been concerns regarding the safety of laparoscopic surgery and risk of transmission of the coronavirus disease [1,2]. As a result, laparoscopic surgeons are at risk of skill deterioration, and it is uncertain whether this may have an impact on patient safety when lockdown measures are de-escalated. Combining gardening, one of the major pastimes during the lockdown period, and minimal access surgical skills, this video demonstrates the different ways minimal access surgery may be applied to horticulture. In the first described technique, what the author believes to be hedge bindweed (Calystegia sepium) was excised using a grasper and a tripolar cutting device (Fig. 1). For obvious reasons diathermy is not available within the home environment, but the retractable cutting blade was used to efficiently slice through the stems required for weed removal. The disadvantage of this technique is clearly that the unwanted species is likely to regrow in 12 months. In the second described technique, dandelions (genus Taraxacum) (Fig. 2), which are native to Eurasia and North America, were excised at the flowering stage, thereby effectively preventing asexual reproduction by apomixis. The technique similarly uses the retractable blade of the tripolar cutting device. The third technique demonstrates harvesting of an unknown species using a soil dissection technique. To facilitate complete removal of the plant and to reduce the risk of recurrence, the roots are carefully dissected out using blunt dissection. As with many techniques, patience is of paramount importance. Last, ensuring hydration of plants is crucial to their early stage of development. Laparoscopic watering techniques are usually simplified when an irrigation and suction device is employed. However, within a low-resource setting a slow process of “cup feeding” is required and requires meticulous dexterity (Fig. 3). Unfortunately, during this demonstration a common complication of a loss of instrument occurred, but the subject was luckily successfully hydrated. Conclusion While a lockdown remains in place, many gynecologists are not able to maintain their laparoscopic surgical skills. It is important to combine activities of daily living with minimal access training to maintain our physical and mental well-being. More research is clearly needed in the area of minimal access horticulture to expand this new and exciting subspecialty.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian Patients Switched to Remote Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Results Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health status of medical staff in emergency departments during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in China","Background The emergency department is considered to be a high-risk area, as it is often the first stop for febrile patients who are subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. Methods Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. Outcomes A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. Interpretation The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Nowhere to hide: The significant impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures on elite and semi-elite South African athletes","Objectives To describe the perceptions of South African elite and semi-elite athletes on return to sport (RTS); maintenance of physical conditioning and other activities; sleep; nutrition; mental health; healthcare access; and knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design Cross- sectional study. Methods A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p <0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. Results 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1–6 months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p <0.0001), daily (61%; p <0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p <0.0001) and for 30–60min (72%). During leisure time athletes preferred sedentary above active behaviour (p <0.0001). Sleep patterns changed significantly (79%; p <0.0001). A significant number of athletes consumed excessive amounts of carbohydrates (76%; p <0.0001; males 73%; females 80%). Many athletes felt depressed (52%), and required motivation to keep active (55%). Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). Conclusions COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry.

"Correlation between immune response and self-reported depression during convalescence from COVID-19","Self-reported depression has been observed in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during discharge from the hospital. However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist","The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook.

"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Subjective neurological symptoms frequently occur in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection","Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata”, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. Results We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms are present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Health professionals facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: What are the mental health risks?","Résumé Objectifs La pandémie de la maladie à coronavirus (COVID-19) a provoqué une crise sanitaire majeure et mis en quarantaine la moitié de la population planétaire. En France, elle a provoqué une réorganisation en urgence de l’offre de soins mobilisant les soignants dans un climat d’incertitude. L’objectif du présent article est de faire le point sur les risques associés à l’exposition des soignants au COVID-19 pour leur santé mentale. Méthodes Les auteurs ont conduit une revue de la littérature internationale tenant compte des données des précédentes épidémies (SARS-CoV-1, H1N1) et des données plus récentes concernant le COVID-19. Résultats Les caractéristiques de cette pandémie (rapidité de diffusion, connaissances incertaines, sévérité, décès de soignants) ont installé un climat anxiogène. Des facteurs organisationnels peuvent être source de stress : déficit d’équipement de protection individuel, réaffectation de postes, manque de communication, manque de matériels de soins, bouleversement de la vie quotidienne familiale et sociale. D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. Abstract Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID 19–Depression and Neurosurgeons","Objective The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusions Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry","This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection: A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","Objective To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Study design Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction. All patients were discharged home with median duration of pediatric intensive care unit stay of 4.7 days (IQR, 4-8 days) and a hospital stay of 7.8 days (IQR, 6.0-10.1 days). One patient (3%) died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Conclusions Critically ill children with coronavirus disease-2019-associated MIS-C have a spectrum of severity broader than described previously but still require careful supportive intensive care.

"A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p > 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures. As countries around the world brace for an escalation in cases, Governments should focus on effective methods of disseminating unbiased COVID-19 knowledge, teaching correct containment methods, ensuring availability of essential services/commodities, and providing sufficient financial support.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.028","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Frontline nurses’ burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","Background During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. Findings On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. Interpretation The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences: Systematic review of the current evidence","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002–2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19.

"Safety signals for QT prolongation or Torsades de Pointes associated with azithromycin with or without chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine","Background Combinations of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin have been promoted as treatments for COVID-19 based on small, uncontrolled clinical trials that have not assessed potential risks. Risks of treatment include QT segment prolongation, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and death. This comparative pharmacovigilance analysis evaluated the risk of these events. Methods Data from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) (>13 million total reports) were used. Queries extracted reports based on exposures of HCQ/chloroquine (CQ) alone, azithromycin alone, HCQ/CQ + azithromycin, amoxicillin alone, HCQ/CQ + amoxicillin alone. Amoxicillin served as a control. Events of interest included death and TdP/QT prolongation as well as accidents/injuries and depression as control events. Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated where a lower limit of the of 95% CI (Lower95CI) value of =2.0 is interpreted as a potential safety signal. Results Lower95CIs for HCQ/CQ alone showed no potential safety signals for TdP/QT prolongation, death, or any of the control events included. The PRRs and 95% CIs for TdP/QT prolongation was 1.43 (1.29–2.59) with HCQ/CQ use alone and 4.10 (3.80–4.42) for azithromycin alone. For the combined HCQ/CQ + azithromycin group, the PRR and 95% CI was 3.77 (1.80–7.87). For the control of amoxicillin, there were no safety signals when used alone or in combination with HCQ/CQ. Conclusions HCQ/CQ use was not associated with a safety signal in this analysis of FAERS data. However, azithromycin used alone was associated with TdP/QT prolongation events and should be used with caution.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.016","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Abstract Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

"Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic","Summary Background Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I 2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n = 500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p < 0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p < 0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p = 0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p = 0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p = 0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p = 0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p = 0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p = 0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p = 0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p = 0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population. Moreover, our study is the first to investigate temperament and attachment characteristics in the psychological response to the ongoing pandemic. Our results provide further insight into developing targeted intervention strategies.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.048","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The immediate impact of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak on subjective sleep status","Background An outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been ongoing in China since January 2020. The threat of infection affects the work and life of most of the population and may also damage sleep. This study aims to examine the subjective sleep status and mental health of the population during the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method The data were collected through an online questionnaire with a sample of 5461 individuals in China from February 5, 2020, to February 23, 2020. Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. Results Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p < 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p < 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p < 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups. A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed. Conclusion The results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19. As prevention and treatment efforts continue with regard to COVID-19, the general public has developed poor sleep hygiene habits, which deserve attention.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.05.018","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic","Résumé Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Abstract Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"“Quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak: Changes in diet and physical activity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease”","Aims CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Data synthesis Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home. Conclusion Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"At the height of the storm: Healthcare staff's health conditions and job satisfaction and their associated predictors during the epidemic peak of COVID-19","This study reports the physical health, mental health, anxiety, depression, distress, and job satisfaction of healthcare staff in Iran when the country faced its highest number of total active COVID-19 cases. In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

"Spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID-19","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, China. It typically presents with mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and may have life threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, shock, and even death. Coronavirus infections are known to have neuroinvasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients in the TriNetX database, which is a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data from a network of health care organizations (HCOs) from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headache (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%), Encephalopathy (2.3%), Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%) and 0.6% had seizures.

Design and Measurements During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Results Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Conclusion Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: A mixed-method study","Since the end of 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of “Perceived Helplessness”, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman’s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study","Background/Objective The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. Method Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. Results In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control. Conclusions The results emphasize the protective effect of PMH in extraordinary situations such as the current outbreak of COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Addictovigilance contribution during COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown in France","Summary Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for abuse and dependence. This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19). COVID-19 epidemic has been an important challenge for addictovigilance, and has proved that this monitoring is highly essential for alerting health professionals and health authorities to points of vigilance in the field of psychoactive substances.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.therap.2020.06.006","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Is returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic stressful? A study on immediate mental health status and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of Chinese workforce","This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work. Our findings would provide information for other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.055","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Método Participan 1.501 personas (rango de edad: 18 a 88 años). Se evaluaron el grado de ansiedad, tristeza y soledad, y la autopercepción del envejecimiento. Se dividió a la muestra en función del grupo de edad y por cuartiles (bajo, intermedios y alto) en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y autopercepción del envejecimiento. Resultados Las personas mayores informan de menor ansiedad y tristeza que los de mediana edad y jóvenes, y los de mediana edad de menores niveles que los jóvenes. Los de mediana edad informan de menor soledad, seguidos de los mayores y los jóvenes. Para cada grupo de edad, aquellos con una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento informan de mayor ansiedad, tristeza y soledad. Hay más comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en jóvenes y menos en mayores; más personas deprimidas en mediana edad, menos mayores con ansiedad, y más mayores y menos jóvenes sin sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva. Para todos los grupos de edad, las personas con comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva son las que tienen puntuaciones altas en autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento. Conclusiones Las personas mayores informan de menos malestar psicológico que otros grupos de edad. Tener una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento perjudica a la salud psicológica, independientemente de la edad. Abstract Objectives To analyze differences by age group in anxiety, depression, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and depression in young people, middle aged adults and older adults during the lock-down period at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the association between negative self-perceptions of aging and psychological symptoms controlling by age group. Method Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Results Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging. Conclusions Older adults reported lower psychological anxiety, sadness and loneliness than the other age groups.

"Ayurveda and COVID-19: Where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health consequences during the initial stage of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain","The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD. The impact on our mental health caused by the pandemic and the measures adopted during the first weeks to deal with it are evident. In addition, it is possible to identify the need of greater psychological support in general and in certain particularly vulnerable groups.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.040","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Infertility remains a top stressor despite the COVID-19 pandemic","Research question What is the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertility patients? Design An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice in the USA between 1 January 2019 and 1 April 2020. At three different time-points respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of 10 commonly reported life stressors. Results The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients, with 3604 responses (response rate 34%) received. A total of 2202 non-pregnant female respondents were included in the final analysis. One-third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one-quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking antidepressant medications. At all three time-points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor among the respondents in early March but, at the time of writing, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66%, respectively). A total of 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Además, se recogieron otras variables descriptivas de la muestra que podrían estar relacionadas con estos niveles de sintomatología psicológica. Resultados Los resultados muestran que la pandemia de la COVID-19ha generado entre el personal sanitario síntomas de estrés, ansiedad, depresión e insomnio, con mayores niveles entre las mujeres y profesionales de más edad. Variables como haber estado en contacto con el virus o el miedo en el trabajo desencadenaron una mayor sintomatología. Conclusiones En esta situación crítica, el colectivo de profesionales se sitúa en primera línea, por lo que está expuesto directamente determinados riesgos y estresores.

Abstract Introduction After the outbreak of the COVID-19 was considered a global pandemic in March 2020, the state of alarm was declared in Spain. In this situation, health professionals are experiencing high levels of stress due to the overload of work the pandemic is generating and the conditions in which they are working. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors that can destabilize the mental health of these professionals in our context. Materials and methods The sample was composed of 421 health professionals. The data were gathered by an online questionnaire sent to them by e-mail. The DASS-21 was used to assess anxiety, stress and depression, and the EAI to measure sleep difficulties. In addition, other descriptive variables that could be related to psychological symptomatology were collected from the sample. Results The results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has generated symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression and insomnia among health workers, with higher levels among women and older professionals. Some factors such as having been in contact with the virus or fear at work, triggered greater symptomatology. Conclusions In this critical situation, professionals are in the front line and therefore, are directly exposed to certain risks and stressors. This contributes to the development of diverse psychological symptoms. Consequently, it is recommended to offer them psychological help in order to reduce the emotional impact of the COVID-19, and thus, to ensure not only the mental health of our health professionals, but also the adequate care they provide.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rpsm.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Strategies to Promote Social Connections Among Older Adults During “Social Distancing” Restrictions","ABSTRACT Older age and medical comorbidity are factors associated with more severe illness and risk of death due to COVID-19 infection. Social distancing is an important public health strategy for controlling the spread of the virus and minimizing its impact on the older adult population. It comes at a cost, however. Loneliness is associated with myriad adverse health outcomes, one of which is impaired immune functioning, which adds even greater risk for coronavirus infection, complications and death. Older adults, therefore, are at compound risk, making effective management of loneliness and social isolation in our older patients a high priority target for preventive intervention. In this paper, the authors describe a cognitive-behavioral framework for social connectedness, including evidence-informed strategies clinicians can use to help patients develop a “Connections Plan” to stay connected and promote their social, mental, and physical health during “social distancing” restrictions. This set of strategies can be provided during brief (30 minute) telephone sessions and is analogous to creating a “Safety Plan” for suicide risk. The approach is illustrated with three case examples.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?","Résumé Ce texte envisage de porter un regard sur les conséquences psychologiques de la situation sanitaire liée au COVID-19 à partir du concept d’optimisme. Depuis plusieurs années, la psychologie positive s’est saisie de cette notion déjà bien connue du grand public, qui a également fait l’objet d’une élaboration conceptuelle majeure dans le domaine scientifique. À ce titre, il nous semble que le concept d’optimisme soit particulièrement utile et pertinent pour comprendre les conduites de nos concitoyens et son influence possible dans la période de confinement qui s’impose actuellement à tous, de la même manière qu’il est nécessaire de penser l’« après » et ses conséquences à court, moyen et long terme, tant sur le plan économique que sur celui de la santé morale et physique de nos concitoyens. Traditionnellement, être optimiste c’est être confiant dans l’issue positive d’un événement, alors qu’à l’inverse, le pessimisme, c’est plutôt s’attendre au pire. L’incertitude que nous imposent ce virus et les situations inédites qui en découlent nous contraint à penser le monde de demain en des termes nouveaux, ce qui peut être déstabilisant. Comprendre la contribution du concept d’optimisme dans la potentialisation des processus adaptatifs que chacun de nous pourra ou non mobiliser pour faire face et s’adapter à cette crise sanitaire inédite et sans précédent est essentiel. Cela constituera sans doute un défi majeur pour les sciences sociales et la psychologie. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous pensons que le concept d’optimisme peut contribuer à apporter des éléments d’éclairage complémentaires qui nous permettront de mieux saisir les conduites rationnelles (ou non) auxquelles nous pourrions être confrontés dans l’avenir, et dans lesquelles nous sommes déjà impliqués. Abstract This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies. Interpretation Early evidence suggests that a considerable proportion of HCWs experience mood and sleep disturbances during this outbreak, stressing the need to establish ways to mitigate mental health risks and adjust interventions under pandemic conditions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.026","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","Purpose The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Methods Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M age = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. Results For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Adolescents' Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health","Purpose Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychopathological consequences of confinement","Résumé Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. Abstract The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers","Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Dexmedetomidine and worsening hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19: A case report","Emergency department management of hypoxemia in the setting of COVID-19 is riddled with uncertainty. The lack of high-quality research has translated to an absence of clarity at the bedside. With disease spread outpacing treatment consensus, provider discretion has taken on a heightened role. Here, we report a case of dexmedetomidine use in the setting of worsening hypoxemia, whereby oxygenation improved and intubation was avoided. Well known pharmacologic properties of the drug, namely the lack of respiratory depression and its anti-delirium effects, as well as other possible physiologic effects, suggest potential benefit for patients being managed with a delayed intubation approach. If dexmedetomidine can improve compliance with non-invasive oxygen support (the current recommended first-line therapy) while promoting better oxygenation, it may also decrease the need for mechanical ventilation and thus improve mortality.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.05.066","20200101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Jail incarceration, social sanitary confinement and ways of escape","Résumé L’enfermement carcéral et le confinement socio-sanitaire liés à la pandémie du COVID-19 sont rapprochés à la faveur de la diffusion du film documentaire de Valérie Müller Danser sa peine, en notant des comportements réactionnels similaires de la population qui imagine et invente des moyens pour bouger, s’occuper… Le film évoque les ateliers de danse menés dans la prison Les Baumettes de Marseille par le chorégraphe renommé Angelin Preljocaj avec des détenues, jusqu’à la performance Soul Kitchen (1919) dansée hors les murs, bien accueillie par le public. L’expérience carcérale conforte les détenues-danseuses dans les processus de conscience sensorielle et identitaire, d’estime de soi, de réintégration sociale. Les répercussions touchant les corps et les âmes renvoient aussi à une réflexion –en miroir– sur l’actualité anxiogène et contraignante du confinement : cohabitation dans le respect d’autrui ou insupportable (surnombre, conflit, violence conjugale…), détresse des personnes vulnérables ou isolées en EHPAD malgré des aménagements soignant… en insistant sur les ressources psychocorporelles positives, vitalisantes, propices à de bienfaisantes « évasions ». Abstract Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women start with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, lead by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women's physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population –youth to elderly– try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

"Pathogenicity of a QX-like avian infectious bronchitis virus isolated in China","ABSTRACT Avian infectious bronchitis is a serious and highly contagious disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). We isolated a highly virulent IBV strain (CK/CH/JS/TAHY) from kidneys of diseased chickens. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S1 gene revealed that CK/CH/JS/TAHY clustered with the QX-like type. The S1 gene has 1,620 nucleotides and encoded a polypeptide of 540 amino acids with typical coronavirus cleavage recognition sites of HRRR. About 1-day-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens inoculated with CK/CH/JS/TAHY at 105.5 EID50 exhibited clinical signs including coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and tracheal vocalization accompanied by depression with 84% mortality and 100% morbidity. The kidneys of dead birds were swollen and pale and exhibited severe urate deposition. Histopathological examination revealed kidney hemorrhages, multifocal necrosis of the renal tubules and trachea with cilia loss, sloughing of epithelial cells, and edema of the lamina propria. IBV-specific antibodies appeared at 10 D post-infection. Chickens vaccinated with a CK/CH/JS/TAHY oil-emulsion vaccine showed 26.7% morbidity and 3% mortality indicating a protective effect.

The extreme virulence, the speed of propagation resulted in restrictions and home confinement. This change was immediately perceived by people who found themselves exposed to feelings of uncertainty, fear, anger, stress and a drastic change in the diurnal but above all nocturnal lifestyle. For these reasons, we aimed to study the quality of sleep and its connection to distress levels and evaluate how lifestyle changed in the Italian population during the lockdown. Methods Through an internet survey we recruited 6,519 adults during the whole COVID-19 lockdown (from 10thMarch – 1st phase - to 4th May – 2nd phase). We investigated the socio-demographic and COVID-19 related information and assessed sleep quality using the Medical Outcomes Study - sleep scale (MOS-SS) and mental health with the short form of Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales – 21 Items (DASS-21). Multiple logistic regression model was used to evaluate the multivariate association between the dependent variable (good sleeper vs. poor sleeper) and all the variables that were significant in the univariate analysis. Results 3,562 (55.32%) participants reported poor sleep quality according to the MOS-Sleep Index II score. The multiple binary logistic regression results of poor sleepers reveal several risk factors during the outbreak restrictions: female gender, living in Central Italy, having someone close who died due to COVID-19, markedly changed sleep-wake rhythm characterized by earlier or postponed habitual bedtime, earlier habitual awakening time and reduced number of afternoon naps, extremely severe levels of stress, of anxiety, and of depression. Conclusions This is the first study designed to understand sleep quality and sleep habits during the whole lockdown in the Italian population that provides more than 6,000 participants in a survey developed specifically for the health emergency related to COVID-19. Our study found that more than half of the Italian population have had impaired sleep quality and sleep habits elevated psychological distress during the COVID-19 lockdown containment measures. A multidisciplinary action should be taken in order to plan appropriate responses to the current crisis caused by the COVID-19 health emergency.","Christian Franceschini et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46228-DDF-9E6","20200725","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Sleep-wake Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; sleep habits; sleep quality; depression; italian lockdown; clinical psychology; stress; anxiety; risk factor; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Understanding the lived experiences of Healthcare Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Interpretative phenomenological analysis","Background: Little research has examined mental health and well-being in the context of healthcare professionals (HCP) working during the COVID-19 pandemic within the UK. To our knowledge, no research has employed qualitative methodologies in order to examine this. We therefore aim to address this gap in research by qualitatively examining the lived experiences of HCPs in Northern Ireland, working during the early stages of the pandemic and lockdown period (14.04.20 and 29.04.20). Method: Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used to qualitatively examine the lived experiences of healthcare professionals, who were working during the COVID-19 outbreak. Ten HCPs were recruited via a social media campaign and snowball sampling. All interviews were conducted via telephone and transcribed verbatim. Results: Three superordinate themes with subordinate themes were elicited through the analysis. Theme one broadly captured present and future challenges of HCPs working during the pandemic. Theme two captured the mental health and wellbeing of HCPs and theme three captured HCPs’ perceptions of the attitudes of the general public towards HCPs. Conclusions: To the authors’ knowledge this is the first study to explore in depth, the unique experiences of frontline HCPs in Northern Ireland, offering a detailed account of the challenges confronted in these unprecedented circumstances and highlighting support needs within this cohort.","Emily Mcglinchey et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624A-FA7-032","20200724","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; mental health; healthcare professionals; psychological wellbeing; qualitative research; covid-19; key workers","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Self-compassion buffers the adverse mental health impacts of COVID-19-related threats: Results from a cross-sectional survey at the first peak of Hong Kong’s outbreak","COVID-19 has brought tremendous and abrupt threats to various aspects of our daily lives, from school and work to interpersonal relationships. Self-compassion is put forth as a salutogenic perspective on oneself that buffers the adverse mental health impacts of these threats. During the peak of a local outbreak in Hong Kong in Spring 2020, 761 participants completed questionnaires on self-compassion, perceived threats, as well as perceived benefits and psychological distress. Controlling for demographic variables, negative indicators of self-compassion (aka self-coldness) was found to intensify the impacts of threats on psychological distress. The positive indicators of self-compassion also moderated the link between threats and perceived benefits, such that perceived benefits tend to be less related to threats in participants with higher self-compassion. Our findings highlight the impacts of both positive and negative indicators of self-compassion on the adjustment to such unprecedented challenges, and point to the possibility of enhancing people’s resilience through fostering self-compassion and alleviating self-coldness.","Bobo Hi Po Lau et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-7BA-829","20200723","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; mental health; hong kong; anxiety; covid-19; depression; self-compassion; self-coldness","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Validation of the French Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and its Associations with Depression, Anxiety and Differential Emotions","Abstract The COVID-19 crisis represents a global health concern, including mental health. Regarding the necessity to assess anxiety related to COVID-19, a scale was developed (Ahorsu et al., 2020). The goal of the present study was to validate of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in French (official language in 29 countries), and investigate its relationship with indicators of affective disturbances. The study was performed on 316 participants. The FCV-19S underwent a double back translation procedure. Its psychometric properties were evaluated. The French FCV-19S demonstrated a stable unidimensional structure with robust psychometric properties (strong internal consistency, good convergent and divergent validity, and good test- retest validity). With its robust psychometric properties in assessing the unidimensional construct of the fear of COVID-19, this scale will help to provide a better understanding of the relationship between emotions and psychological or psychiatric disorders during the pandemics in French-speaking countries.","Arnaud Carre et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46141-444-F07","20200721","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; mental health; fear; french validation; fear of covid-19 scale; scale development; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological distress and adaptation to the COVID-19 crisis in the United States","Background There is growing concern that the COVID-19 crisis may have long-standing mental health effects across society particularly amongst those with pre-existing mental health conditions. In this observational population-based study, we examined how psychological distress changed following the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and tested whether certain population subgroups were vulnerable to persistent distress during the crisis. Methods We analyzed longitudinal nationally representative data from seven waves of the Understanding America Study (UAS) collected between March 10th and June 23rd, 2020 (N=7231 Obs.= 40199). Differences in distress trends were examined by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and household income and by the presence of a pre-existing mental health diagnosis. Psychological distress was assessed using the standardized total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4). Findings On average psychological distress increased significantly by 0.27 standard deviations (95% CI [0.23,0.31], p<.001) from March 10-18 to April 1-14, 2020 as the COVID-19 crisis emerged and lockdown restrictions began in the US. Distress levels subsequently declined to mid-March levels by the end of June (d =-.31, 95% CI [-0.35,-0.27], p<.001). Across all sociodemographic groups examined and those with pre-existing mental health conditions we observed a sharp rise in distress followed by a recovery to baseline distress levels. Interpretation This study identified substantial increases in distress in the US during the emergence of the COVID-19 crisis that largely diminished in the weeks that followed and suggests that population level resilience in mental health may be occurring in response to the pandemic.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46077-F92-717","20200721","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; adaptation; mental health; resilience; psychological distress; covid-19; longitudinal research","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health risk factors during COVID-19 pandemic in the Polish population","Background: The level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) associated with the COVID-19 outbreak, stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed. Risk factors for mental health in the Polish population have been identified. Methods: The 926 respondents completed a set of questionnaires consisting of questions concerning COVID-19, PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (Impact of Event Scale-Revised, IES-R) and their mental health status (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, DASS-21). Results: Most respondents reported severe PTSS related to the COVID-19 outbreak (44.06%), normal intensity of depressive symptoms (52.38%), anxiety symptoms (56.05%) and stress (56.48%). Female gender, parental status, having a relationship, at least a two-person household are associated with higher PTSS and DASS-21 subscale. A few physical symptoms, a medical visit, quarantine, negative health evaluation, and chronic diseases, knowledge of the increase in the number of infected people and the number of deaths are associated with higher levels of PTSS. Some of the precautions and the need for additional information on COVID-10, the certainty of a high probability of contracting COVID-19, a low survival rate and concerns about loved ones are associated with higher PTSS.

"Measuring COVID-19 Fear in Australian, Indian, and Nepali University Students","The present study describes the adaption and scale validation of a brief measure of contagion-related fear and threat in Australian, Indian, and Nepali university students in Australia at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Adapted from Ho, Kwong-Lo, Mak, and Wong’s (2005) SARS fear scale, the Contagion Fear and Threat Scale (CFTS) was rapidly adapted to capture the experience of COVID-19 pandemic-related fear. The factor structure and validity of the 6-item scale were established among Australian (n=155), Indian (n=111), and Nepali (n=148) university students studying in Australia in May-June 2020. Factor analysis revealed two 3-item factors in the Australian student sample: Fear of Infection and Existential Threat. These factors were confirmed in the Indian and Nepali student samples and mirror those found by the Hoe eta al. (2005) in the original instrument. The convergent and discriminant validity of the full CFTS, Fear, and Threat scales are indicated via correlations with established measures of depression, anxiety, stress and subjective wellbeing. Features of the early, first-wave context are considered in understanding score differences between samples.","Francesca Eileen Collins","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-590-B7C","20200706","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; australian; university students; mental health; covid-19; contagion-related fear; scale validation; covid-19-related fear; nepali; fear; indian","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Development of the Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS)","Abstract Parenting is critical to creating and maintaining healthy child development. Importantly, there are multiple determinants of effective parenting, including the psychological resources of the parent, contextual sources of stress and support, and characteristics of the child. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in colossal disruptions to family life, and has fundamentally altered the landscape of parenting. In the face of escalating infection and mortality rates, rising unemployment, financial insecurity, school closures, and shelter-in-place orders, parents have had to create new environments in which their children can flourish while, in many cases, continuing to juggle ongoing work, health, and emotional stressors of their own. Several recent reviews have offered a variety of recommendations for parents to promote child well-being during the COVID-19 outbreak. However, no measures have been developed to assess how parents have adapted their parenting behaviors in response to the pandemic. To better understand the lasting impact of the pandemic on children’s socioemotional health and well-being, we urgently need to characterize the impact of the pandemic on parenting practices. Accordingly, the current study developed the 24-item Parenting In a Pandemic Scale (PIPS) to assess behaviors enacted by parents to mitigate infection risk, manage children’s social and emotional needs, structure children’s activities, help with schoolwork or education, and promote physical activity. The scale is available in English and Spanish and is freely accessible for research, educational, or scientific purposes. We anticipate the PIPS being employed in studies alongside other, validated measures of parenting practices, parenting stress, or parental burnout, as well as in relation to measures of child mental health and resilience in the face of the pandemic.","Rebecca Waller et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461F0-521-BA3","20200714","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle & Late Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; covid-19; adolescence; parenting practices; parent-child relationships; parenting; family; childhood; parents; moms; home environment; children; dads","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Natural language processing reveals vulnerable mental health support groups and heightened health anxiety on Reddit during COVID-19","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting a devastating impact on mental health, but it is not clear how people with different types of mental health problems were differentially impacted as the initial wave of cases hit. Objective: We leverage natural language processing (NLP) with the goal of characterizing changes in fifteen of the world's largest mental health support groups (e.g., r/schizophrenia, r/SuicideWatch, r/Depression) found on the website Reddit, along with eleven non-mental health groups (e.g., r/PersonalFinance, r/conspiracy) during the initial stage of the pandemic. Methods: We create and release the Reddit Mental Health Dataset including posts from 826,961 unique users from 2018 to 2020. Using regression, we analyze trends from 90 text-derived features such as sentiment analysis, personal pronouns, and a “guns” semantic category. Using supervised machine learning, we classify posts into their respective support group and interpret important features to understand how different problems manifest in language. We apply unsupervised methods such as topic modeling and unsupervised clustering to uncover concerns throughout Reddit before and during the pandemic. Results: We find that the r/HealthAnxiety forum showed spikes in posts about COVID-19 early on in January, approximately two months before other support groups started posting about the pandemic. There were many features that significantly increased during COVID-19 for specific groups including the categories “economic stress”, “isolation”, and “home” while others such as “motion” significantly decreased. We find that support groups related to attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), eating disorders (ED), and anxiety showed the most negative semantic change during the pandemic out of all mental health groups. Health anxiety emerged as a general theme across Reddit through independent supervised and unsupervised machine learning analyses. For instance, we provide evidence that the concerns of a diverse set of individuals are converging in this unique moment of history; we discover that the more users posted about COVID-19, the more linguistically similar (less distant) the mental health support groups became to r/HealthAnxiety (<U+03C1> = -0.96, P<.001). Using unsupervised clustering, we find the Suicidality and Loneliness clusters more than doubled in amount of posts during the pandemic. Specifically, the support groups for borderline personality disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder became significantly associated with the Suicidality cluster. Furthermore, clusters surrounding Self-Harm and Entertainment emerged. Conclusions: By using a broad set of NLP techniques and analyzing a baseline of pre-pandemic posts, we uncover patterns of how specific mental health problems manifest in language, identify at-risk users, and reveal the distribution of concerns across Reddit which could help provide better resources to its millions of users. We then demonstrate that textual analysis is sensitive to uncover mental health complaints as they arise in real time, identifying vulnerable groups and alarming themes during COVID-19, and thus may have utility during the ongoing pandemic and other world-changing events such as elections and protests from the present or the past.","Daniel Mark Low et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461EF-7EF-7C1","20200713","PsyArXiv|Engineering Psychology; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Bipolar and Related Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Computational Modeling; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; adhd; mental health; suicidality; nlp; psychiatry; reddit; machine learning; covid-19; health anxiety; natural language processing; eating disorders","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"High Work-related Stress and Anxiety Response to COVID-19 among Healthcare Workers in South Korea: SAVE study","Background: We investigated the risk factors associated with the psychological impact of each healthcare worker group, to help optimize psychological interventions for healthcare workers in countries affected by COVID-19. Methods: Participants for this study comprised 1,783 healthcare workers drawn from two hospitals inKorea. We adopted a cross-sectional online survey design and used an anonymous questionnaire from 20-30 April 2020, with information on demographics, psychiatric history, Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics - 9 (SAVE-9), Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) scale. Results: Among the 1,783 healthcare workers, compared to other healthcare workers, nursing professionals had significantly higher levels of depression, general anxiety, and virus-related anxiety symptoms (p < 0.01). In the nursing professionals group, single workers reported more severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 = 10) than married workers (20.3% vs 14.1%; p < 0.01), and junior (< 40 years old) workers reported more anxiety about the viral epidemic (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis adjusted with age, sex, and work duration identified three factors as significantly associated with healthcare worker's depression (PHQ-9 = 10): being a nursing professional (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 – 1.98), single (adjusted OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.01 – 1.83), and higher stress and anxiety to the viral infection (high SAVE-9 score, adjusted OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.15 – 1.22). Conclusions: Psychological support and interventions for healthcare workers, especially nursing professionals, single, and high SAVE-9 level should be considered.","Myung Hee Ahn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46235-117-0B7","20200718","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing","COVID-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages given known age differences in social preferences, and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early popular media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. Across two samples, we found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporally discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Additionally, although older adults reported being more likely to contract COVID-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall COVID-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.","Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Development and validation of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS)","During respiratory viral epidemics and pandemics such as the COVD-19 pandemic, everyday behaviors such as leaving the house and touching frequently-used surfaces become the subject of fear and avoidance due to their potential for contagion. Despite the potential mental health related impact of this psychological phenomenon, there are currently no measures available that are designed to evaluate the extent to which individuals become fearful of these everyday situations during a respiratory viral pandemic. Here, we developed and assessed the psychometric properties of the Avoidance of Respiratory Viral Infection Scale (ARVIS) questionnaire across two samples recruited online (ns = 243, 341) recruited during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results indicate that the ARVIS is best described by a single factor and shows a high reliability (Chronbach’s alpha > .88). It showed convergent associations with state anxiety and low discriminant associations with general trait anxiety and depression. Moreover, the ARVIS was highly associated with the extent to which subjects reported engaging in handwashing and social distancing, demonstrating criterion validity. This new scale provides a validated measure for assessing virus-related fear that can facilitate research into the psychological effects of respiratory virus pandemics.","Toby Wise et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-488-9B0","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; pandemic; fear; infection; avoidance; anxiety; covid","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Validation to Spanish version of the COVID-19 Stress Scale","There is a global consensus about the potential of the COVID-19 pandemic to affect people's mental health. In this context, and prior to the formulation of mitigation strategies, tools are required that allow an objective and effective assessment of mental health risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of COVID-19 Stress Scale, formulated by Taylor et al. (2020), based on the concept of COVID-19 Stress Syndrome. A national sample of 1214 participating adults was taken in Colombia, who answered a translated version of the scale. Evidence of a hexa-dimensional structure was obtained whose goodness of fit indicators were Chi2 = 1215,759, Sig. =. 000, CMIN / DF = 2.202, RMSEA = .044, NFI = .943, TLI = .964, CFI =. 968 and FMIN = 1,967.

"Multilevel Associations of Daily Skill Use and Effectiveness With Anxiety, Stress, and Depression in a Transdiagnostic Sample Undergoing Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training","Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is relatively effective at treating disorders of emotion dysregulation. However, given researchers’ focus on group-level differences within disorder-specific treatments, it is unclear which transdiagnostic mechanisms influence these effects. Participants (n=19, Mage=31.8, 68% female, 95% Caucasian) with elevated emotion dysregulation completed daily reports of DBT skill use, perceived effectiveness, anxiety, stress, and depression during a DBT skills training group (1,344 observations). We tested whether within-person skill use was associated with same-day negative affect, predicted next-day changes in negative affect, and was moderated by perceived emotion regulation effectiveness. Participants used more within-person skills on days of greater stress and anxiety, which predicted next-day decreases in stress and anxiety. On days of high, but not low, perceived effectiveness, people used more skills in response to more intense negative affect.

"A Person-Centered Approach to Profiling COVID-Related Experiences in the United States: Preliminary Findings from the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities around the world. Intensive health precautions have created constraints on mobility, work, education, family life, and interpersonal relationships. Preliminary survey studies have reported an increase in the prevalence and severity of psychosocial impairments in the pandemic’s immediate wake. However, the impact of specific pandemic-related experiences and patterns of experiences has not been systematically assessed and studied. The goal of the present study was to develop and conduct a preliminary empirical test of a novel, comprehensive assessment of pandemic-related experiences, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), using person-centered latent class analysis (LCA). Aims were to (1) test the hypothesis that LCA would identify unique subgroups based on patterns of negative and positive pandemic-related experiences across personal and social domains, and (2) examine whether identified subgroups would significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health and functioning. Results supported hypotheses, with several unique subgroups identified across domains that were differentiated on sociodemographic characteristics and measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and perceived social support. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This study, combined with future research with the EPII, may serve to inform public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the current pandemic and under similar mass public health crisis circumstances in the future.","Damion Grasso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707","20200701","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19; pandemic; epidemic; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Dynamic patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep during the first month of strict lockdown in two women with major depressive disorder","Mental health research community needs to collect high-quality data to understand the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures in adults with mental disorders. Our aims were to document the day-to-day patterns of depressive symptoms and sleep parameters, and explore the dynamic network structure of measured depressive symptoms during the first four weeks of strict lockdown in two women with major depressive disorder. Data from ecological momentary assessments have been analyzed with idiographic models. In both cases, the self-reported depressive symptoms and core affects fluctuated during the lowckdown. All measured depressive symptoms were not exacerbated and showed different patterns of variation. Psychomotor retardation and level of arousal played a prominent role in the dynamic symptom networks. These case studies contribute to our understanding of the lockdown effects on depressive symptoms and affective experiences, and highlight the need of person-centered mental health care to help people with major depressive disorder during a lockdown.","Paquito Bernard et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46114-B73-F26","20200714","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; sleep; idiographic; depressive symptoms; insomnia; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The quality of research on mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic: A note of caution after a systematic review","Background: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has spurred scientific production in diverse fields of knowledge, including mental health. Yet, the quality of current research may be challenged by the urgent need to provide immediate results to understand and alleviate the consequences of the pandemic. This systematic review aims to examine compliance with basic methodological quality criteria and open science practices on the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A systematic search was performed using PubMed and Scopus databases on the 13th of May. Empirical studies, published in peer-reviewed journals in English, between February and May 2020, were included. The dependent variable(s) required to be quantitative and related to mental health. Exclusion criteria included clinical pharmacological trials, and studies using psychophysiological or biological recordings. The study protocol was previously pre-registered in https://osf.io/bk3gw/. Findings: Twenty-eight studies were identified. More than 75% met the requirements related to reporting key methodological and statistical information. However, 89.3% used convenience samples and 92.86% lacked of a priori power analysis. There was low compliance with open science recommendations, such as pre-registration of studies (0%) and availability of databases (3.57%), which raise concerns about the validity, generalisability, and reproducibility of the findings. Interpretation: While the importance of offering rapid evidence-based responses to mitigate mental health problems stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic is undeniable, it should not be done at the expense of sacrificing scientific rigor. The results of this study may stimulate researchers and funding agencies to try to orchestrate efforts and resources and follow standard codes of good science.","Ines Nieto et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-73A-AF7","20200714","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; research quality; mental health; systematic review; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How handling extreme C-reactive protein (CRP) values influences CRP and depression symptom networks: A replication and extension of Fried et al (2019)","Increasingly, it has been recognized that analysis at the symptom, rather than diagnostic, level will drive progress in the field of immunopsychiatry. Network analysis offers a useful tool in this pursuit with the ability to identify associations between immune markers and individual symptoms, independent of all other variables modeled. However, these analyses require a lot of power and replication is key to determine their utility in this context. Additionally, further investigation into how methodological decisions (i.e., including vs. excluding participants with C-reactive protein (CRP) > 10 mg/L, regularized vs. nonregularized networks) influence results is necessary to establish best practices for the use of network analysis in immunopsychiatry. The current study attempts to replicate Fried et al. (2019), which found CRP to be uniquely associated with sleep problems, fatigue, and changes in appetite. In a sample of 3,464 adult participants from the 2015-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey dataset, this study found consistent support for associations between CRP and fatigue and changes in appetite, no support for an association between CRP and sleep, and some support for additional CRP—symptom associations. Methodologically, results consistently demonstrated that including individuals with CRP > 10 mg/L and estimating nonregularized networks provided better estimates of these associations. Implications for the characterization of an inflammatory phenotype of depression, treatment planning, and designing future studies are discussed.","Daniel Moriarity et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46061-1B6-99B","20200712","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; immunology; replication; phenotype; network analysis; nhanes; inflammation; network; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In the current study, we investigate depressive symptoms as depression is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease and potentially life-threatening. This study reports on a dataset that was collected between April 8 and June 1 2020 through an online survey in several German states. More than 2000 individuals took part in the survey measuring depressive symptoms (as defined in ICD-10). Similar to recent observations from Italy and China, severe depressive symptoms reported were relatively high. Especially younger adults and females reported more severe symptoms compared to other groups. In conclusion, we need to prepare for increased need of psychological services, availability and accessibility already parallel with imposing restrictive measures.","Iris Schelhorn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46204-E18-EC0","20200713","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; depression; online survey; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Evidence for Differential Susceptibility","The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents’ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.","Jonas G.

"Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden","New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health; employment","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the US","Background: Stressful events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have significant effects on psychiatric symptoms, and well-validated methods for assessing psychosocial experiences related to the pandemic are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess the stability of the PSQ and prospective associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity and stability of the PSQ and indicated that experiences of stress are highly prevalent, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with depression and anxiety at each assessment, but did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: The PSQ is a promising measure for assessing COVID-19 pandemic-related events in research and clinical practice. Results provide empirical support for the range of life disruptions as a result of the pandemic and highlight individual differences and experiences associated with the greatest risk for depression and anxiety.","Autumn Kujawa et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E","20200629","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; coronavirus; young adult; pandemics; depression; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic","ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-D39-1F2","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; psychological morbidities; public health; mental health; coping strategies; primary prevention","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Resilience During Uncertainty Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue","Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.","Jonas P.

"Social isolation, mental health and use of digital interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: a nationally representative survey","Background: Public health measures to curb SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates may have negative psychosocial consequences in youth. Digital interventions may help to mitigate these effects. We aimed to investigate the associations between social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress and use of digital mobile health (mHealth) interventions in youth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Data were collected as part of the “Health And Innovation During COVID-19 Survey” —a cross-sectional panel study including a representative sample of individuals aged 16 to 25 years (N=666; Mage 21·3) (assessment period: 07.05.-16.05.2020). Data were collected on social isolation, COVID-19-related worries/anxieties, objective social risk indicators, psychological distress as well as the current use of and attitude towards digital interventions. Outcomes: Social isolation, lack of company, worrying, and objective social risk indicators were associated with psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dose-response relationships were found. For instance, psychological distress was progressively more likely to occur as levels of reported social isolation increased (with reporting ‘never’ as reference group: ‘very rarely’: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·4,CI 1·0 – 5·7, p=0·041; ‘rarely’: aOR 3·6, CI 1·7 – 7·7, p=0·001; ‘occasionally’: aOR 8·4, CI 4·0 – 17·5, p<0·001; ‘often’: aOR 20·6, CI 9·3 – 45·7, p<0·001;’very often’: aOR 43·4, CI 14·7 – 128·2, p<0·001). There was evidence that psychological distress, and high levels of social isolation, lack of company, and worrying were associated with a positive attitude towards using digital interventions, whereas only severe levels of psychological distress and worries were associated with actual use (aOR 2·0, CI 1·3 - 3·0, p=0·001; aOR 1·6, CI 1·1 – 2·2, p=0·005, respectively). Interpretation: Public health measures during pandemics may be associated with social isolation and poor mental health outcomes in youth. Digital interventions may help mitigate the negative psychosocial impact without risk for viral infection given there is an objective need and subjective demand.","Christian Rauschenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D5-4B2-395","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; social isolation; public mental health; youth mental health; mhealth; social risk; worrying; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Digital interventions to mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health: a rapid meta-review","Background: Digital interventions may be used to mitigate psychosocial consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic but evidence-based recommendations are lacking. The aim of this rapid meta-review was to investigate the theoretical base, user perspective, safety, effectiveness, and cost effectiveness of digital interventions in public mental health provision (i.e. mental health promotion, prevention of, and treatment for mental disorder). Methods: A rapid meta-review was conducted. MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and CENTRAL databases were searched on May 11, 2020. Study inclusion criteria were broad and considered systematic reviews that investigated digital tools for health promotion, prevention, or treatment of mental health conditions likely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings: We identified 813 reviews of which 82 met inclusion criteria. Overall, there is good evidence on the usability, safety, acceptance/satisfaction, and effectiveness of eHealth interventions while evidence on mHealth apps is promising, especially if social components (e.g. blended care) and strategies to promote adherence are incorporated. Although most digital interventions focus on the prevention or treatment of mental disorders, there is some evidence on mental health promotion. However, evidence on long-term clinical effects, process quality, and cost-effectiveness is very limited. Interpretation: Accumulating evidence suggests negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health. There is evidence that digital interventions are particularly suited to mitigating psychosocial consequences at the population level. Decision-makers should develop digital strategies for continued mental health care and the development and implementation of mental health promotion and prevention programs in times of quarantine and social distancing.","Christian Rauschenberg et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AD-08E-865","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; ehealth; digital psychiatry; telemedicine; prevention; covid-19; mhealth; intervention; mental health promotion","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Bittersweet Dynamics of Psychological Distress and Relief During New Zealand’s COVID-19 Lockdown Clarify Avoidable Mental Health Burdens","Research indicates COVID-19 lockdowns elevated psychological distress. Here, we leverage national panel data before and during New Zealand’s COVID-19 lockdown to clarify distress buffers (2018/2020, N = 940). To distinguish lockdown-related distress from natural disasters, we investigate distress dynamics following the Christchurch earthquakes (2011, N = 6,806). During lockdown, there were small increases in hopelessness, restlessness, and nervousness, and substantial increases in worthlessness. A sense of neighbourhood community became decoupled from this distress, which high levels of social belonging and health satisfaction did not prevent. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort fostered by social belonging. By contrast, the Christchurch earthquakes increased all distress indicators and distress buffers performed consistently. We infer that losses of employment and social routines during New Zealand’s lockdown, in a setting of government income and health protections, precipitated bittersweet mental health dynamics. That certain pandemic mental health burdens are avoidable has applied interest.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46002-880-A11","20200626","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; wellbeing; social capital; ordinal; worthlessness; employment; lockdown; bayesian; anxiety; routine; kessler-6; buffer","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying.

"Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling).

"Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress","Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables.

"Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences","Intro: When confronted with major threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people often experience (temporary) decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying stability and change of well-being in times of threat like the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined change in mental health symptoms and its relationships with appraisals of the pandemic and daily life experiences during the pandemic, including affective states, stress, and mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. In this report, we worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as a total of 7189 observations from the diary phase. Results: Results showed that less fortunate change in mental health symptoms across three weeks was predicted by more negative affect and less mindfulness, specifically less attention to the present moment, in daily life. Furthermore, less fortunate change in mental health symptoms was correlated with change towards less fortunate appraisals of the appraisals. Finally, we showed that more general views of the pandemic (i.e., appraisals) were interrelated to experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and they show how experiences in daily life matter for change in well-being","Annette Brose et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; well-being; mindfulness; affect; ambulatory assessment; mental health; stress; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.","Ruth Neill et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF","20200701","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; media consumption; mental health; depression; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","Mokhlesur Rahman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Stress and Parenting during the Global COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Stress and compromised parenting often place children at risk of abuse and neglect. Child maltreatment has generally been viewed as a highly individualistic problem by focusing on stressors and parenting behaviors that impact individual families. However, because of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), families across the world are experiencing a new range of stressors that threaten their health, safety, and economic well-being. Objective: This study examined the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in relation to parental perceived stress and child abuse potential. Participants and Setting: Participants included parents (N = 183) with a child under the age of 18 years in the western United States. Method: Tests of group differences and hierarchical multiple regression analyses were employed to assess the relationships among demographic characteristics, COVID-19 related disruptions, mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, and child abuse potential. Results: Greater COVID-19 related disruptions and high anxiety and depressive symptoms are associated with higher perceived stress and child abuse potential. In addition, higher perceived stress is associated with higher child abuse potential. Conversely, greater parental support and perceived control during the pandemic may have a protective effect against perceived stress and child abuse potential. Results also indicate racial and ethnic differences in COVID-19 related disruptions, but not in mental health risk, protective factors, perceived stress, or child abuse potential. Conclusion: Findings suggest that although families experience elevated stressors from COVID-19, providing parental support and increasing perceived control may be promising intervention targets.","Samantha M.

"Generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown Specific predictors and differences in symptoms severity","Background. Previous studies carried out in different countries indicated that young adults experience higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than older age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about which epidemic-related difficulties and factors may contribute to these forms of emotional distress in various age groups. Purpose. The aim of the current study was to investigate: (i) differences in levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms, as well as perceived difficulties related to pandemic across four age groups in the Polish population; (ii) which factors and difficulties related to pandemic are predictors of generalized anxiety and depressive symptoms in various age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Method. A total of 1115 participants (aged 18-85) took part in the study. The group was a representative sample of the Polish population in terms of sex, age, and place of residence. Participants completed online: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9, The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Scale of Perceived Health and Life Risk of COVID-19, Social Support Sale, Scale of Epidemic-Related Difficulties. Results. Younger age groups (18-29 and 30-44) experienced higher levels of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms than older adults (45-59 and 60-85 years). Difficulties in relationships and at home were amongst the strongest predictors of depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms in all age groups. Fear and uncertainty related to the spread of the virus were one of the most important predictors of emotional distress in all the groups apart from the adults between 18-29 years, whereas difficulties related to external restrictions were one of the most significant predictors of depressive and anxiety symptoms only in the youngest group. Conclusions. Our results indicate that the youngest adults and those experiencing difficulties in relationships among household members were the most vulnerable to depressive and generalized anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 lockdown. Thus, it is important to plan preventive and therapeutic interventions to support these at-risk individuals in dealing with the challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Malgorzata Gambin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AE-A00-BD9","20200629","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Middle Adulthood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Old Age; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; covid-19 outbreak; lockdown; depressive symptoms; anxiety symptoms; epidemic-related difficulties","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings","COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

"Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong","Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing have been effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health has not been investigated. We conducted an online survey of residents in Hong Kong. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. The result of this online survey indicates a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis-risk. Loneliness, but not social network size, explained 12.0% to 29.2% of variance in these psychiatric symptoms. To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness. Although the sociopolitical situation of Hong Kong prior to the pandemic was likely another exacerbating factor, given that sociopolitical unrest and violence are common, global problems that co-exist with the pandemic, the case of Hong Kong may prove to be prescient.","Ivy Tso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5","20200627","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; anxiety; psychosis; psychosis risk; psychiatry; stress; covid-19; loneliness; social isolation; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Loneliness in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional results from The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study","Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 – 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms. Improving emotion regulation and sleep quality may be optimal initial targets to reduce the impact of COVID-19 regulations on mental health outcomes.","Jenny Groarke et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E","20200624","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; public health; mental health; covid-19; prevalence; risk factors; cross-sectional studies; protective factors; loneliness; emotion regulation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Environmental reward and self-medication theories suggest that increased distress and greater social/environmental constraints during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to clarify the presence and direction of changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 1127) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in an online survey. The survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes (alcohol use; drinking motives; alcohol demand, and solitary drinking). Outcomes were assessed for two timeframes: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (‘pre-social-distancing’), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (‘post-social-distancing’). Depression severity, coping motives, and frequency of solitary drinking were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Time spent drinking and frequency of binge drinking were greater post-social-distancing compared to pre-social-distancing, whereas typical alcohol quantity/frequency were not significantly different between timeframes. Indices of alcohol demand were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effects of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Results provide early evidence regarding the relation of psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, results largely converged with predictions from self-medication and environmental reinforcement theories. Future research will be needed to study prospective associations among these outcomes.","Matthew Mcphee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46035-C14-752","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; sars-cov-2; depression; covid-19; social distancing; alcohol; stress; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Although research suggests that social isolation affects mental health, reactions may vary depending on individuals. This study aimed to identify personality profiles, and examine whether these profiles were associated with affective and cognitive outcomes. Participants filled in an online questionnaire during the lockdown in France (N = 430). Based on measures of individuals’ preference for solitude, extraversion, emotional stability and openness, a latent profile analysis revealed three profiles: “Affiliation”, “Emotionally Stable Lonely” and “Emotionally Unstable Lonely”. Results showed that individuals with an “Emotionally Unstable Lonely” profile expressed higher stress and anxiety, and performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an “Emotionally Stable Lonely” profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a convergent creative thinking task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns.","Estelle Michinov et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DA-85B-1A0","20200622","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; social isolation; covid-19; creativity; personality profiles; preference for solitude","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study","Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched case–control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. Conclusion: These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.","Abu Sayeed et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-9CC-022","20200617","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; covid-19; comorbidity; bangladesh; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review","The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.","Jenna Sung et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801","20200618","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychological wellbeing of frontline workers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: First and second wave findings from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study","Background: Extant research relating to the psychological impact of infectious respiratory disease epidemics/pandemics suggests that frontline workers are particularly vulnerable. Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of ‘lockdown’ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 – 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%).

The comparison of responses from both surveys indicates that the change in attitudes and mental condition of the respondents occurred. After almost three months of quarantine the youth is less interested in the pandemic, has lower fear of the coronavirus, evaluates the actions taken by government to combat the pandemic worse. A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education.

Results: The results showed that people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants’ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: People’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and people’s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety, as well as finding ways to alleviate people’s COVID-19 anxiety.","Zhuojun Wang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612E-F41-854","20200615","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; china; longitudinal design; well-being; cross-lagged analysis; covid-19 anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.","Jeffrey Wardell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593","20200615","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; drinking motives; social distancing; coronavirus; parent; covid-19; drinking alone; stress; income; alcohol problems; alcohol; solitary drinking; coping; depression; social isolation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Therapeutic alliance, social inclusion and infection control - Towards pandemic-adapted mental health care services in Switzerland","The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the Swiss mental health care system. Many services were downsized or closed and admission to treatment and care institutions was restricted. While these measures were necessary according to the general containment and mitigation strategies of federal and cantonal authorities, this situation has had negative consequences for care and treatment of service users. This paper asks to re-think key aspects of the Swiss mental health care system that have demonstrated to be not adaptable to the pandemic. In particular, the paper suggests diversifying care and treatment settings and strengthening outpatient and outreach services. Finally, some proposals to foster social inclusion during and after the pandemic are outlined.","Dirk Richter et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-DE5-951","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; switzerland; mental health services; pandemic; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological problems associated with coping strategies: a web-based study in Peruvian population during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease has quickly spread to all corners across Latin-American countries. Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46214-0AD-065","20200614","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; mental health; public; mental morbidities; primary prevention; keywords: mental health; psychological morbidities; coping strategies; health information; health promotion","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain","The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales. On the other hand, daily physical activity was found to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Results indicate that people with social anxiety might be especially vulnerable to the development of other mental disorders after the relaxation of the confinement measures.","Álvaro Planchuelo-Gómez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-16D-42D","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; depression; covid-19; longitudinal; anxiety; posttraumatic stress disorder; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Perceived Risk and Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Resilience and Coronavirus Fear","During coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were particularly at high-risk of developing symptoms of mental health problems due to being on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19. This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as critical mechanism that explain the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.","Murat Yildirim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19 perceived risk; covid-19; resilience; mental health problems; healthcare professionals; covid-19 fear","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention","The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001). On average, differences in their perceived ability to handle lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic were positive, but small and at the level of a nonsignificant trend (dav=0.13, dz=0.14, p=0.066).

"Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants were drawn from the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS or Understanding Society), a nationally representative sample of adults in the United Kingdom. Participants were 12,074 men and women with a mean age of 51.6 (range 18-95) who took part in the representative wave 9 (2017–2019) sample of the UKHLS and were followed-up between the 24–30th of April 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12). Results The percentage of participants experiencing mental health problems (GHQ-12 score =3) increased from 23.4% in 2017–2019 to 37.1% in April, 2020. All population subgroups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems. The increase was 9.8% (95% CI [5.4%–14.3%]) greater among those aged 18-34 compared to those aged 50–64, 7.4% (95% CI [4.9%–9.9%]) greater in females compared to males, and 3.6% (95% CI [1.1%–6.1%]) greater amongst those with a degree compared to others. Additional analyses showed that the substantial rise in mental health problems in April, 2020 was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. Conclusions This study suggests that mental health problems may have risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-538-ECB","20200610","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; psychological distress; mental health; representative study; coronavirus; covid-19; public health; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample.

"Mood Symptoms Predict COVID-19 Pandemic Distress but not Vice Versa: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale and was argued to have negatively impacted the population’s mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These find-ings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Benjamin A Katz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-A9E-78B","20200611","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; psychological stress; equivalence testing; anxiety; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology","Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.","Asle Hoffart et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277","20200610","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID Feel Good – An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus","Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.","Giuseppe Riva et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

They were 69.2% female, ranged in age between 18 and 34 years (M = 20.63, SD = 1.99). Results showed that meaning in life and optimism–pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Optimism also mediated the relationship between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, optimism moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life in the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms.

"Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work","The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time. Survey data collected following the March COVID19 stay-at-home orders show that telecommuting mothers more frequently report feelings of anxiety, loneliness and depression than telecommuting fathers. Early estimates of responses to the COVID19 pandemic offer insights into future implications of telecommuting for gender equality at work.","Thomas Lyttelton et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-A87-AC7","20200709","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender; work; working from home; household labor; gender; covid-19; time use; wellbeing; telecommuting; inequality; covid; care work; housework","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.","Bruno Arpino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3","20200707","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; social relationships; mental health; coronavirus; physical distancing; sars-cov-2; consequences of covid-19; covid-19","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean","Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored.

"Applications of artificial intelligence technologies on mental health research during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted mental health globally. It is essential to deploy advanced research methodologies that may use complex data to draw meaningful inferences facilitating mental health research and policymaking during this pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a wide range of opportunities to leverage advancements in data sciences in analyzing health records, behavioral data, social media contents, and outcomes data on mental health. Several studies have reported the use of several AI technologies such as vector machines, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, decision trees, and clustering to detect and treat depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other mental health problems. The applications of such technologies in the context of COVID-19 is still under development, which calls for further deployment of AI technologies in mental health research in this pandemic using clinical and psychosocial data through technological partnerships and collaborations. Lastly, policy-level commitment and deployment of resources to facilitate the use of robust AI technologies for assessing and addressing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mahbub Hossain et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46110-88F-FED","20200623","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; machine learning; covid-19; deep learning; covid19; mental health; artificial intelligence; coronavirus; psychiatric; mental disorders; psychological","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Restarting “normal” life after Covid-19 and the lockdown: Evidence from Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy","Currently, unprecedented series of events are taking place that affect the institutional structure of the world economy and the social fabric of our societies. In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the lockdown, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit by Covid-19. We use a novel data source that we collected to monitor the three countries during the pandemic. As outcome variables, we use expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour. After providing descriptive evidence that is representative of the population of interest, using longitudinal data from the same survey on exposure to shocks and matching techniques, we estimate the impact of exposure to shock occurred during the crisis on the same outcome variables.","Cristiano Codagnone et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-A2C-F06","20200621","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology; expectations; covid19; fear; behavioural change; negative economic shocks","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.","Brendan Fisher et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886","20200612","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?","How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.","Dominik Schraff","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B","20200608","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; corona; political support; netherlands; covid-19; political trust","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"The Role of Digital Connectivity in Supply Chain and Logistics Systems: A Proposed SIMPLE Framework","Industry 4.0 and its related-cutting edge technologies are generating unprecedented changes and bringing complex challenges in practically all types of business. In this context, new concepts such as digital connectivity, interconnection, and interoperability emerged as highly disruptive approaches for logistics systems and supply chain management (SCM). To shed more light on these complexities and see how companies organized in a SCM model can adopt, implement and operate in a digital connectivity model, this study proposes a framework, namely SIMPLE. To develop the framework, we employed a literature review approach, focusing on recent studies published in journals. After the literature analysis, six dimensions related to digital connectivity in supply chains and logistics emerged, namely Smart, Innovative, Measurable, Profitable, Lean, and Excellence (SIMPLE). This framework brings opportunities for future studies, while providing important insights into the dynamics of digital connectivity in logistics and supply chains. Therefore, these SIMPLE framework dimensions should enable the actors involved in organizations’ operations to interact adequately and harmoniously so as to maximize the value generated in the network.","Queiroz, Maciel M.; Fosso Wamba, Samuel","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-44999-5_7","20200306",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This exploratory study aims to determine the nature of cyber-harassment victimization, its enablers, and the coping mechanisms that online platforms provide to prevent or stop cyber-harassment. An online survey of ninety (n = 90) LGBTQIA+ young adults of ages between 18 and 34 from South Africa reveals a high incidence of exclusion, outing and harassment, covering a wide variety of types, duration and experienced severity, taking place through text messaging and social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Most LGBTQIA+ youth resort to measures such as blocking, deleting offensive content and adjusting privacy settings to cope with cyber-victimization. Worryingly, the most severe effects of harassment such as depression, drug abuse, self-harm and suicide contemplation, have significant correlations with the harassment type used, harassment duration and harassment frequency. The paper discusses the implications for educational and social practice and future studies.","Hendricks, Kayla; Tsibolane, Pitso; van Belle, Jean-Paul","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45002-1_12","20200310",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Understanding Depression from Psycholinguistic Patterns in Social Media Texts","The World Health Organization reports that half of all mental illnesses begin by the age of 14. Most of these cases go undetected and untreated. The expanding use of social media has the potential to leverage the early identification of mental health diseases. As data gathered via social media are already digital, they have the ability to power up faster automatic analysis. In this article we evaluate the impact that psycholinguistic patterns can have on a standard machine learning approach for classifying depressed users based on their writings in an online public forum. We combine psycholinguistic features in a rule-based estimator and we evaluate their impact on this classification problem, along with three other standard classifiers. Our results on the Reddit Self-reported Depression Diagnosis dataset outperform some previously reported works on the same dataset. They stand for the importance of extracting psychologically motivated features when processing social media texts with the purpose of studying mental health.","Trifan, Alina; Antunes, Rui; Matos, Sérgio; Oliveira, Jose Luís","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45442-5_50","20200324",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Beyond Modelling: Understanding Mental Disorders in Online Social Media","Mental disorders are a major concern in societies all over the world, and in spite of the improved diagnosis rates of such disorders in recent years, many cases still go undetected. Nowadays, many people are increasingly utilising online social media platforms to share their feelings and moods. Despite the collective efforts in the community to develop models for identifying potential cases of mental disorders, not much work has been done to provide insights that could be used by a predictive system or a health practitioner in the elaboration of a diagnosis. In this paper, we present our research towards better visualising and understanding the factors that characterise and differentiate social media users who are affected by mental disorders from those who are not. Furthermore, we study to which extent various mental disorders, such as depression and anorexia, differ in terms of language use. We conduct different experiments considering various dimensions of language such as vocabulary, psychometric attributes and emotional indicators. Our findings reveal that positive instances of mental disorders show significant differences from control individuals in the way they write and express emotions in social media. However, there are not quantifiable differences that could be used to distinguish one mental disorder from each other.","Ríssola, Esteban Andrés; Aliannejadi, Mohammad; Crestani, Fabio","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45439-5_20","20200317",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Community-acquired pneumonia among children: the latest evidence for an updated management()","OBJECTIVE: To provide cutting-edge information for the management of community-acquired pneumonia in children under 5 years, based on the latest evidence published in the literature. DATA SOURCE: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, by using the expressions: “community-acquired pneumonia” AND “child” AND “etiology” OR “diagnosis” OR “severity” OR “antibiotic”. All articles retrieved had the title and the abstract read, when the papers reporting the latest evidence on each subject were identified and downloaded for complete reading. DATA SYNTHESIS: In the era of largely implemented bacterial conjugate vaccines and widespread use of amplification nucleic acid techniques, respiratory viruses have been identified as the most frequent causative agents of community-acquired pneumonia in patients under 5 years. Hypoxemia (oxygen saturation = 96%) and increased work of breathing are signs most associated with community-acquired pneumonia. Wheezing detected on physical examination independently predicts viral infection and the negative predictive value (95% confidence interval) of normal chest X-ray and serum procalcitonin < 0.25 ng/dL was 92% (77-98%) and 93% (90-99%), respectively. Inability to drink/feed, vomiting everything, convulsions, lower chest indrawing, central cyanosis, lethargy, nasal flaring, grunting, head nodding, and oxygen saturation < 90% are predictors of death and can be used as indicators for hospitalization. Moderate/large pleural effusions and multilobar infiltrates are predictors of severe disease. Orally administered amoxicillin is the first line outpatient treatment, while ampicillin, aqueous penicillin G, or amoxicillin (initiated initially by intravenous route) are the first line options to treat inpatients. CONCLUSIONS: Distinct aspects of childhood community-acquired pneumonia have changed during the last three decades.","Nascimento-Carvalho, Cristiana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedp.2019.08.002","20200318",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"One Health Aotearoa: a transdisciplinary initiative to improve human, animal and environmental health in New Zealand","There is increased recognition that complex health challenges at the human-animal-environmental interface require a transdisciplinary, “whole-of-society” approach. This philosophy is particularly pertinent in Aotearoa-New Zealand because of the country’s relatively isolated island ecosystem, economic reliance on agriculture and its intensification, and existing indigenous worldview that emphasises holism and interconnectivity between humans, animals and the environment. In New Zealand, the One Health Aotearoa (OHA) alliance was established in order to better connect researchers and to address a growing number of infectious diseases challenges. The emphasis of OHA is to bring together and facilitate interactions between people from diverse disciplines, link to stakeholders and communities, and engage with policy-makers, government operational agencies, and funders, thus providing a holistic and integrative systems-thinking approach to address priority questions and achieve desired outcomes in One Health. The initial focus of OHA has been on infectious diseases, but there is increasing recognition of the potential benefits of the alliance to address broader complex issues. Greater involvement and overlap of the environmental sciences, human and animal health sciences, social science, and indigenous kaupapa Maori research is particularly critical for ensuring its success within the New Zealand context. Given the economic and cultural importance of New Zealand’s “clean, green” image, a One Health approach that draws strongly on the environmental sciences makes particular sense. Furthermore, as the global environment becomes increasingly stressed by anthropogenic pressures our research may hold potential solutions for similar challenges elsewhere.","Harrison, Sarah; Baker, Michael G.; Benschop, Jackie; Death, Russell G.; French, Nigel P.; Harmsworth, Garth; Lake, Robin J.; Lamont, Iain L.; Priest, Patricia C.; Ussher, James E.; Murdoch, David R.","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s42522-020-0011-0","20200131",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Quality Improvement Innovation in a Maternal and Child Health Network: Negotiating Course Corrections in Mid-Implementation","This article analyzes mid-implementation course corrections in a quality improvement innovation for a maternal and child health network working in a large Midwestern metropolitan area. Participating organizations received restrictive funding from this network to screen pregnant women and new mothers for depression, make appropriate referrals, and log screening and referral data into a project-wide data system over a one-year pilot program. This paper asked three research questions: (1) What problems emerged by mid-implementation of this program that required course correction? (2) How were advocacy targets developed to influence network and agency responses to these mid-course problems? (3) What specific course corrections were identified and implemented to get implementation back on track? This ethnographic case study employs qualitative methods including participant observation and interviews. Data were analyzed using the analytic method of qualitative description, in which the goal of data analysis is to summarize and report an event using the ordinary, everyday terms for that event and the unique descriptions of those present. Three key findings are noted. First, network participants quickly responded to the emerged problem of under-performing screening and referral completion statistics. Second, they shifted advocacy targets away from executive appeals and toward the line staff actually providing screening. Third, participants endorsed two specific course corrections, using “opt out, not opt in” choice architecture at intake and implementing visual incentives for workers to track progress. Opt-out choice architecture and visual incentives served as useful means of focusing organizational collaboration and correcting mid-implementation problems.","McMillin, Stephen Edward","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42972-020-00004-z","20200508",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Engaging in Late-Life Mental Health Research: a Narrative Review of Challenges to Participation","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This narrative review seeks to ascertain the challenges older patients face with participation in mental health clinical research studies and suggests creative strategies to minimize these obstacles. RECENT FINDINGS: Challenges to older adults’ engagement in mental health research include practical, institutional, and collaboration-related barriers applicable to all clinical trials as well as more personal, cultural, and age-related patient barriers specific to geriatric mental health research. Universal research challenges include (1) institutional barriers of lack of funding and researchers, inter-researcher conflict, and sampling bias; (2) collaboration-related barriers involving miscommunication and clinician concerns; and (3) practical patient barriers such as scheduling issues, financial constraints, and transportation difficulties. Challenges unique to geriatric mental health research include (1) personal barriers such as no perceived need for treatment, prior negative experience, and mistrust of mental health research; (2) cultural barriers involving stigma and lack of bilingual or culturally matched staff; and (3) chronic medical issues and concerns about capacity. SUMMARY: Proposed solutions to these barriers include increased programmatic focus on and funding of geriatric psychiatry research grants, meeting with clinical staff to clarify study protocols and eligibility criteria, and offering transportation for participants. To minimize stigma and mistrust of psychiatric research, studies should devise community outreach efforts, employ culturally competent bilingual staff, and provide patient and family education about the study and general information about promoting mental health.","Newmark, Jordyn; Gebara, Marie Anne; Aizenstein, Howard; Karp, Jordan F.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s40501-020-00217-9","20200522",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Intimate Partner Violence Prevention and Intervention Group-Format Programs for Immigrant Latinas: a Systematic Review","Immigrant Latinas (IL) experiencing intimate partner violence (IPV) often experience barriers to accessing formal support systems due to immigration-related issues (e.g., fear of deportation, language proficiency, lack of family support in the U.S.). This paper contains a systematic review of peer-reviewed published articles within the past 25 years addressing IPV prevention and intervention programming designed for this vulnerable population. We examined specific group-format programs and curricula conducted at community-based agencies with social services across the country. Qualitative analysis of the 10 articles that met search criteria (i.e., programs must be culturally specific, designed to serve IL, conducted in group-format, focused on IPV intervention or prevention) generated information regarding the nature of group interventions addressing this issue and population. Several themes emerged upon completion of the qualitative review describing key characteristics of each intervention. All reviewed articles reported generally positive outcomes using a variety of methods. Studies using quantitative methods found statistically significant outcomes for constructs including depression, self-esteem, and knowledge of wellness. Professionals from diverse practice settings working with IL would likely benefit by developing intervention and prevention group-format programming to address this problem.","Marrs Fuchsel, Catherine L.; Brummett, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10896-020-00160-6","20200523",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Trust in and Ethical Design of Carebots: The Case for Ethics of Care","The paper has two main objectives: to examine the challenges arising from the use of carebots as well as to discuss how the design of carebots can deal with these challenges. First, it notes that the use of carebots to take care of the physical and mental health of the elderly, children and the disabled as well as to serve as assistive tools and social companions encounter a few main challenges. They relate to the extent of the care robots’ ability to care for humans, potential deception by robot morphology and communications, (over)reliance on or attachment to robots, and the risks of carebot use without informed consent and potential infringements of privacy. Secondly, these challenges impinge upon issues of ethics and trust which are somewhat overlapping in terms of concept and practice. The existing ethical guidelines, standards and regulations are general in nature and lack a central ethical framework and concrete principles applicable to the care contexts. Hence, to deal with these important challenges, it is proposed in the third part of the paper that carebots be designed by taking account of Ethics of Care as the central ethical framework. It argues that the Ethics of Care offer the following advantages: (a) it provides sufficiently concrete principles and embodies values that are sensitive and applicable to the design of carebots and the contexts of caring practices; (b) it coheres with the tenets of Principlism and select ethical theories (utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics); and (c) it is closely associated with the preservation and maintenance of trust.","Yew, Gary Chan Kok","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12369-020-00653-w","20200523",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Suicidal ideation, psychopathology and associated factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia","BACKGROUND: Suicidal behavior is a prevalent psychiatric emergency in HIV-infected adults. Detection of suicidal ideation is important in planning early psychiatric intervention and optimizing HIV/AIDS management. Characterization of suicidal ideation among HIV-infected adults is crucial; however, practically there is no data in Indonesia, the country with the second largest burden of HIV/AIDS epidemic in Asia. This study aims to identify suicidal ideation and analyze the associated psychopathology and determining factors among HIV-infected adults in Indonesia. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study was conducted among HIV-infected adults aged 18–65 years old receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). Measurement using Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) was performed to assess the existing psychopathology. Firth’s penalized logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with suicidal ideation. RESULTS: A total of 86 subjects were recruited. Most subjects were male (65.1%), median age was 35 years, and median latest CD4 count was 463 cells/µl. Lifetime suicidal ideation was identified in 20 subjects (23.3%). Mean SCL-90 T-score for depressive and anxiety symptoms were both significantly higher among subjects with suicidal ideation (M = 60.75, SD = 12.0, p = 0.000 and M = 57.9, SD = 2.8, p = 0.001, respectively) compared to those without. Bivariate analyses showed that lifetime suicidal ideation was associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, non-marital status, CD4 count < 500 cells/µl, and efavirenz use. Multivariate analysis identified that a single-point increase in SCL-90 depression symptoms score (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 4.5–123.6, p = 0.000) and efavirenz use (AOR 5.00, 95% CI 1.02–24.6, p = 0.048) were significant independent factors related to suicidal ideation. CONCLUSION: Suicidal ideation is commonly found among Indonesian HIV-infected adults on ART. Depressive symptoms and efavirenz use are independent factors related to the presence of suicidal ideation. Thus, early screening of psychopathology as well as substitution of efavirenz with other ART regiment are recommended to prevent suicide and improve HIV/AIDS management outcome.","Ophinni, Youdiil; Adrian; Siste, Kristiana; Wiwie, Martina; Anindyajati, Gina; Hanafi, Enjeline; Damayanti, Reza; Hayashi, Yoshitake","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02666-1","20200524",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Basic Income Advocacy in Canada: Multiple Streams, Experiments and the Road Ahead","Basic income has a long history in Canada, going back to the Great Depression. Its recognition has risen and fallen cyclically, several experiments have been mounted, and some programs, such as the Canada Child Benefit and the Old Age Security demogrant, have been identified as partial basic income schemes. However, a universal basic income for all members of the Canadian political community has never been visibly close to implementation. Against this background, this chapter examines basic income political advocacy from three vantage points. First, the multiple streams framework is used to assess linkages of basic income in the problem stream, its position in the policy stream and forces at play in the political stream. Next, the fate of experiments is described, along with approaches for increasing the likelihood that experiments will result in full-scale policy implementation if outcomes are sufficiently promising. Third, some advocacy strategies for the future are recommended.","Frankel, Sid","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-43904-0_8","20200527",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Know Yourself: An Adaptive Causal Network Model for Therapeutic Intervention for Regaining Cognitive Control","Long term stress often causes depression and neuronal atrophies that in turn can lead to a variety of health problems. As a result of these cellular changes, also molecular changes occur. These changes, that include increase of glucocorticoids and decrease of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have the unfortunate effect that they decrease the cognitive abilities needed for the individual to solve the stressful situation. Such cognitive abilities like reappraisal and their adaptation mechanisms turn out to be substantially impaired while they are needed for regulation of the negative emotions. However, antidepressant treatments and some other therapies have proved to be quite effective for the strengthening of such cognitive abilities. This study introduces an adaptive causal network model for this phenomenon where a subject loses his or her cognitive abilities (negative metaplasticity) due to long-term stress and re-improve these cognitive abilities (positive metaplasticity) through mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Simulation results have been reported for demonstration of the phenomenon.","Ullah, Nimat; Treur, Jan","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_28","20200506",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Thirty-five percent of workers who telecommute said their mental health had deteriorated as a result of doing so amid the COVID-19 lockdown, according to a survey conducted by researchers at Keio University in Tokyo, among other institutions, Fox Business reported April 13. The survey was conducted online March 26–28, involving 8,475 employees — including nonregular workers — aged 20 to 64. Of the 21% of respondents who said they work from home, one-half of them did so in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Among the telecommuters, 50.7% said it had no impact on their mental health, and 14.3% said their mental health had improved. Of the respondents who said doing telework had worsened their mental state, 41.3% said it was difficult to separate their work and personal lives, followed by 39.9% who said they weren't able to exercise enough and 39.7% who said they had difficulty communicating with co-workers. Professor Isamu Yamamoto of the Keio University Faculty of Business and Commerce, who conducted the survey, said: “There is a risk that working hours will get longer if the boundaries between work and personal life become blurred. It is necessary to establish a rigid system in which work can be carried out in a planned manner, such as by setting working hours and the timing of contact with supervisors.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32333","20200417",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Last week, Congress passed its fourth (actually, it was 3.5) stimulus “coronavirus relief” bill. The funding goes mainly to small businesses, followed by hospitals and testing. Originally, it was all going to go to small business, which ran out of its allotment from the $2 trillion in the first package in short order. Democrats added the hospitals and testing. None goes to states for public health or to substance use disorder treatment or prevention. Reporters covering the separate stories of the stimulus package and opioid overdoses never converged on coverage, and most of the opioid stories predicted that the pandemic would make the opioid crisis worse. The opportunity to make changes for the better was restricted, in this field, to removing regulations, not to increasing funding. It is hoped that more funding for treatment for substance use disorder will follow.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32705","20200424",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Caffeine for the Treatment of Apnea in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Overview of Meta-Analyses","BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a common treatment for neonatal intensive care management of the developmental complication of apnea of prematurity in preterm infants. There are several systematic reviews (SRs) on the performance of caffeine in the treatment of apnea. The evidence provided by those, however, is depressed by an information overload due to high heterogeneity in the characteristics as well as the quality of these SRs. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to provide a systematic overview of SRs on the use of caffeine for the management of neonatal apnea. Such overviews are a recent method used to assess and filter top evidence among SRs, enabling enhanced access to targeted information of interest. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted via EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and PubMed since inception to January 2020. Two reviewers independently conducted study selection and data extraction, and assessed the quality of methods and the risk of bias in included SRs based on A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) and Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tools. Extracted data related to study type, characteristics, patients, intervention, comparator, regimen, and outcome measures. RESULTS: Seven SRs with meta-analyses (SRMAs) were included in the current overview, involving a total of 63,315 neonates. SRMAs included randomized clinical and observational studies, with various types of patients, comparators, and outcomes. The quality of SRMAs ranged from critically low (n = 1), low (n = 1), moderate (n = 2), to high (n = 3), and the risk of bias was unclear (n = 2), low (n = 4), and high (n = 1). The effectiveness of caffeine with regard to treatment success and the rate of apnea was not significantly different from that of theophylline or doxapram in two SRMAs. Against control, in one SRMA, while caffeine reduced the rate of failure as well as the need for pressure ventilation, it did not significantly reduce mortality. This comparative effectiveness of caffeine was based on high-quality SRMAs with a low risk of bias. The effectiveness against apnea seems to be enhanced via the administration of early (0–2 days) or high doses of caffeine in one and three SRMAs, respectively. This, nevertheless, was based on lower-quality SRMAs with a higher risk of bias. Safety outcomes were mostly based on comparative SRMAs of different drug regimens, whereby, less tachycardia and lower risk for complications were reported with lower and earlier caffeine administrations, respectively. The evidence behind this, however, was limited in quantity and quality. CONCLUSION: While limited in quantity, there is evidence of non-inferior effectiveness of caffeine against other methylxanthines or doxapram for the management of apnea in neonates. Owing to the limited quality, however, limited evidence exists in support of an optimal administration regimen for caffeine. Further controlled studies are, therefore, needed to confirm the comparative usefulness of caffeine as well as to assess its different potential regimens, including in relation to safety.

"Le confinement généralisé pendant l’épidémie de Coronavirus: Conséquences médico-psychologiques en populations générales, soignantes, et de sujets souffrant antérieurement de troubles psychiques","Background. – The situation we are currently experiencing is unprecedented. Declaring a state of health emergency in order to curb a frightening epidemic, the authorities have decreed the home confinement of the majority of the population of our country for several weeks. In a few days, innumerable questions arise for very diverse spaces: epidemiological, immunological, sociological, information scientists, medical, administrative, political, etc. Objective. – We propose a reflection intended to describe the psychological risks, to clarify the disorders found and, to discuss the means to take care of them in the duration. Material and methods. – We base our thinking on a review of the literature confronted with our current clinical experience, including concerning the possibilities of dematerialized medico-psychological monitoring. Results. – We recall the collective repercussions of emerging lethal mass risks, and in particular viral infectious agents, before approaching the existing scientific models of collective confinement according to military operations in hostile zones, polar wintering missions and aerospace conquest. It appears that for the study of a global containment, somewhat studied during previous pandemics, the conceptions of stress reaction and psychodynamic adaptation prove to be relevant. We detail the psychological consequences of confinement on individual mental health and their countermeasures according to three population typologies: general population, population of caregivers on the front line against the epidemic, and population of subjects already suffering from mental illness or seeing their disorders reappear. We also refer to works in social cognitive psychology explaining how, in an anxiety-provoking situation, reasoning can be biased and lead to choices that ultimately prove to be not very rational, in the opinion of those who made them. The current situation in the health sector is favorable in this, as evidenced by the ""debate on chloroquine"" widely reported in the media and on social networks, opposing conclusions most often decided on the basis of beliefs on contrary to evidence based medicine. Discussion. – The psychological repercussions of confinement appear conditioned by the multiple forms that it can take: voluntary or suffered, more or less prolonged, spent at home or in another place, lived in individual isolation or in a small community, associated other stressors and/or traumatic factors, etc. The home confinement of a population across a country has never been assessed. This experience seems to us to confront our society as a whole with the taboo of death which is imposed, death more and more evaded as the ""Western man"" tries to move away from his terrestrial origins. In this sense, psychotraumatic type repercussions are to be prevented. In order to face multiple challenges, the healthcare system has adapted with, in particular, the development of the use of the Internet for the provision of information intended to better experience confinement, or even the generalization of psychotherapy remotely asking as many questions as it provides answers. These intricacies of computer techniques in the area of psychotherapy, techniques with which we had some mistrust, became established as quickly as the virus: the task of clinicians and researchers to measure the issues and the consequences. Conclusion. – Public health programs could emerge on the model of those already existing in order to manage well-known chronic endemic disorders: protection against the effects of an unbalanced diet associated with a sedentary lifestyle, fight against smoking and alcoholism, prevention of self-aggressive behavior, etc. We will also need to support the caregivers who have been on the front line and who will emerge tested from this pandemic: will depend on the sustainability of the action capacities of our healthcare system to return to its nominal state and also perhaps, so that it can face other crises, especially social ones.","Auxéméry, Yann; Tarquinio, Cyril","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.001","20200605",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Secondary Trauma and Parenting Practices in Internet Crimes against Children Task Force Investigators","Investigating cases of child pornography requires daily exposure to sexually explicit material involving children and may have negative implications on the mental well-being of those in this line of work. This study aimed to identify whether secondary traumatic stress symptoms were associated with participants’ parenting behaviors and concerns about their own children’s use of the internet. Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force workers (n = 212) completed online questionnaires measuring work exposure to sexually explicit material, secondary traumatic stress symptoms, and parenting behaviors. Professionals in this field reported a wide range of secondary trauma symptoms, and their parenting behaviors were both directly and indirectly (via secondary trauma) affected by prolonged exposure to sexually explicit material involving children. Internet monitoring behaviors were more prevalent for parents of younger children, and mothers’ parenting behaviors were more strongly associated with secondary trauma symptoms than were fathers. Results have implications for mental health and parenting services for professionals in this field.","Stewart, Jonathan; Witte, Tricia H.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09530-8","20200606",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"In Case You Haven't Heard…","Should therapists have a therapist? Science says yes, according to Valentina Stoycheva, Ph.D., founder of Stress & Trauma Evaluation and Psychological Services, in the May 24 issue of Psychology Today. “The longer the current COVID-19 pandemic lasts and the higher its death toll, the more prominent the need for mental health services will become,” Stoycheva wrote. “In turn, this may create a situation in which the demands on mental health professionals' time are at their peak, while their exposure to secondary traumatic stress is increased.” Stoycheva wrote that the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention warns that suicide risk for physicians (including psychiatrists) prior to COVID-19 was 1.5 to 2.25 times higher than the general population. “… A combination of several factors, including exposure to traumatic stress, the mental health needs of society as a whole, and the unwritten code of ethics of healthcare workers, may compromise therapists' own mental health and ability to seek help.

In a data brief released last month, the OIG notes that people with opioid use disorder (OUD) could be particularly hard hit by COVID-19, because of increased risk of respiratory disease, and that most Medicare beneficiaries at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose in 2017 received high amounts of opioids the following year. However, only a quarter received a prescription for naloxone, which reverses opioid overdoses. In addition, only 7% of beneficiaries who were at serious risk in 2017 who were diagnosed with an OUD received a medication-assisted treatment drug, “possibly because of challenges that beneficiaries have in accessing prescribers.” For the policy brief, go to https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-02-19-00130.asp.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32741","20200529",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Structuring mental health support for frontline caregivers during COVID-19: lessons from organisational scholarship on unit-aligned support","BACKGROUND: Although the COVID-19 pandemic exposes frontline caregivers to severe prolonged stresses and trauma, there has been little clarity on how healthcare organisations can structure support to address these mental health needs. This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions. We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services. In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen/women). FINDINGS: To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Army’s efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis. We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings. CONCLUSION: Addressing frontline caregivers’ mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisations’ response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short. An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising.","DiBenigno, Julia; Kerrissey, Michaela","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000279","20200602",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Ontology-Based Inference for Supporting Clinical Decisions in Mental Health","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental and behavioral disorders are increasingly common and currently affect on average 1/4 of the world’s population at some point in their lives, economically impacting communities and generating a high social cost that involves human and technological resources. Among these problems, in Brazil, the lack of a transparent, formal and standardized mental health information model stands out, thus hindering the generation of knowledge, which directly influences the quality of the mental healthcare services provided to the population. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a computational ontology to serve as a common knowledge base among those involved in this domain, to make inferences about treatments, symptoms, diagnosis and prevention methods, helping health professionals in clinical decisions. To do this, we initially carried out a literature review involving scientific papers and the most current WHO guidelines on mental health, later we transferred this knowledge to a formal computational model, building the proposed ontology. Also, the Hermit Reasoner inference engine was used to deduce facts and legitimize the consistency of the logic rules assigned to the model. Hence, it was possible to develop a semantic computational artifact for storage and generate knowledge to assist mental health professionals in clinical decisions.","Yamada, Diego Bettiol; Bernardi, Filipe Andrade; Miyoshi, Newton Shydeo Brandão; de Lima, Inácia Bezerra; Vinci, André Luiz Teixeira; Yoshiura, Vinicius Tohoru; Alves, Domingos","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-50423-6_27","20200523",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Application of Healthcare ‘Big Data’ in CNS Drug Research: The Example of the Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN)","Neurological and psychiatric (mental health) disorders have a large impact on health burden globally. Cognitive disorders (including dementia) and stroke are leading causes of disability. Mental health disorders, including depression, contribute up to one-third of total years lived with disability. The Neurological and mental health Global Epidemiology Network (NeuroGEN) is an international multi-database network that harnesses administrative and electronic medical records from Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. Using these databases NeuroGEN will investigate medication use and health outcomes in neurological and mental health disorders. A key objective of NeuroGEN is to facilitate high-quality observational studies to address evidence-practice gaps where randomized controlled trials do not provide sufficient information on medication benefits and risks that is specific to vulnerable population groups. International multi-database research facilitates comparisons across geographical areas and jurisdictions, increases statistical power to investigate small subpopulations or rare outcomes, permits early post-approval assessment of safety and effectiveness, and increases generalisability of results. Through bringing together international researchers in pharmacoepidemiology, NeuroGEN has the potential to be paradigm-changing for observational research to inform evidence-based prescribing. The first focus of NeuroGEN will be to address evidence-gaps in the treatment of chronic comorbidities in people with dementia.","Ilomäki, Jenni; Bell, J. Simon; Chan, Adrienne Y.

"Improving the Intensive Care Patient Experience With Virtual Reality—A Feasibility Study","OBJECTIVES: Patients’ stays in the ICU are often characterized by prolonged immobility, sedation, disrupted sleep, and extended periods of pain, which put ICU patients at greater risk for ICU-acquired weakness and delirium-related mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of using meditative virtual reality to improve the hospital experience of ICU patients. DESIGN: Final report of prospective observational trial. SETTING: Surgical and trauma ICUs of the University of Florida Health, an academic hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-nine nonintubated adult ICU patients without delirium at recruitment. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were exposed to sessions of commercially available meditative virtual reality applications focused on calmness and relaxation, performed once daily for up to 7 days. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures included pain level, pain medication administration, anxiety, depression, sleep quality, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, delirium status, and patient ratings of the virtual reality system. Comparisons were made using paired t tests and mixed models. The virtual reality meditative intervention improved patients’ ICU experience with reduced levels of anxiety and depression; however, there was no evidence that virtual reality had significant effects on physiologic measures, pain, or sleep. CONCLUSIONS: The use of meditative virtual reality technology in the ICU was easily implemented and well-received by patients.","Ong, Triton L.; Ruppert, Matthew M.; Akbar, Maisha; Rashidi, Parisa; Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Tezcan; Bihorac, Azra; Suvajdzic, Marko","https://www.doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000122","20200608",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The Efficacy of Albumin Dialysis in the Reversal of Refractory Vasoplegic Shock Due to Amlodipine Toxicity","OBJECTIVES: Calcium channel blockers are highly protein-bound medications frequently used in the management of hypertension. Overdose results in severe hypotension and is the fourth most common cause of toxicity-related deaths in the United States. Management is mostly supportive, with currently no standard role for targeted drug removal. The protein-bound nature of these medications presents the option of utilizing albumin dialysis for their removal and for the reversal of associated shock. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We present two cases of life-threatening intentional amlodipine overdoses successfully treated with albumin dialysis. Both patients experienced profound distributive shock in the setting of preserved cardiac contractility that was refractory to maximal vasoactive agent support. INTERVENTIONS AND RESULTS: After initiation of albumin dialysis, the patients showed rapid hemodynamic improvement and were able to be weaned off vasopressor support. CONCLUSIONS: These cases demonstrate the safety and efficacy of albumin dialysis in the management of near-fatal calcium channel blocker overdoses related to amlodipine and offer an additional therapeutic option apart from conventional supportive care. Importantly, these cases were not associated with impaired cardiac contractility, thereby making venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation a less preferable option. Furthermore, this therapeutic benefit of albumin dialysis can potentially be extended to the management of toxicity related to other highly protein-bound drugs and toxins.","Connor-Schuler, Randi L.; Carr, Jennifer M.; Reaven, Matthew S.; Bridgman, Bob T.; Patel, Deepa M.; Subramanian, Ram M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1097/cce.0000000000000120","20200605",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The impact of delayed time to first CT head in traumatic brain injury","PURPOSE: Trauma team activation (TTA) criteria trigger early mobilization of resources for the sickest trauma patients. Patients with moderately depressed GCS who do not trigger the highest level activation are at risk for adverse outcomes, potentially from delayed time to intervention. The study objective was to define the impact of time to first CT Head (CTH) on outcomes among blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS. METHODS: Patients from the Trauma Quality Improvement Program (TQIP) databank (2013–2016) with first ED GCS 9–12 were included. Transfers, penetrating mechanisms, death < 24 h, AIS = 6 in any body region, and patients with severe associated injuries were excluded. Study groups were defined by time to first CTH after ED arrival: immediate (= 1 h) vs. delayed (1–6 h). Primary outcomes were time to neurosurgical intervention and time to ED discharge. RESULTS: After exclusions, 4997 patients were identified. Of these, 79% (n = 3,954) underwent immediate CTH and 21% (n = 1,043) had delayed CTH. Median GCS was 11 [10–12] in both groups and there was no difference in median Head AIS (4 [3–4] vs. 4 [3–4], p = 0.586). Time to craniotomy and ICP monitor insertion were longer in the delayed group (4.2 h [3.0–7.6] vs. 3.1 h [2.1–8.7], p = 0.001; and 5.7 h [3.8–13.0] vs. 4.4 h [2.6–12.0], p = 0.008), as was time in the ED (4.3 h [2.7–6.5] vs. 2.1 h [1.2–3.7], p < 0.001). There was no difference in need for craniotomy (11% vs. 10%, p = 0.287), need for ICP monitor (12% vs. 12%, p = 0.899), or mortality (11% vs. 9%, p = 0.160). On multivariate analysis, age > 65 (OR 2.813, p < 0.001), SBP < 90 mmHg (OR 2.934, p < 0.001), ED intubation (OR 1.486, p = 0.001), and Head AIS scores of 4 (OR 1.884, p < 0.001) and 5 (OR 6.729, p < 0.001) were independently associated with death. CONCLUSIONS: Immediate CTH for blunt trauma patients with moderately depressed GCS decreases time to intervention and reduces ED time. A protocol to shorten time to CTH may be beneficial for both patients and hospitals.","Schellenberg, Morgan; Benjamin, Elizabeth; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Inaba, Kenji; Demetriades, Demetrios","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00068-020-01421-1","20200625",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Localization of Cell Receptor-Related Genes of SARS-CoV-2 in the Kidney through Single-Cell Transcriptome Analysis","BACKGROUND: The new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which has been responsible for the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, uses the cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for spike (S) protein priming. Meanwhile, the presence of B0AT1 (SLC6A19) may prevent TMPRSS2 from accessing the cutting position on ACE2. Identifying the expression of these cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in various tissues, especially in the kidney. METHODS: The single-cell transcription datasets of the human cell landscape (HCL) and other relevant single-cell transcription databases were used to analyze the expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and SLC6A19 in various organs and tissues, but mainly in the kidney. RESULTS: ACE2 was significantly expressed in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of proximal tubule (PT) cells. TMPRSS2 was widely expressed in several renal tubule populations extending from the PT cells to the collection system cell type, of which intercalated cells and the distal convoluted tubule cells showed more significant expression than PT cells. Unexpectedly, although expressed on various renal tubule populations, SLC6A19 was mainly enriched in PT cells, in line with ACE2 expression. Although alveolar-type (AT) 2 cells of the lung and intestinal epithelial cells expressed ACE2 as well as PT cells, AT 2 cells significantly expressed TMPRSS2 but not SLC6A19, while all 3 genes were significantly expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: ACE2 was widely expressed in specific cell subgroups of various human tissues, especially in intestinal epithelial cells, kidney PT cells, and also AT 2 cells of the lung. These 3 types of cells demonstrated significant differences in the distribution of the cell receptor-related genes of SARS-CoV-2, which may indicate the diversity of cell surface structures and differences in the affinity between SARS-CoV-2 and cells.","Chen, Qi-Lin; Li, Jia-Qi; Xiang, Zhi-Dan; Lang, Yue; Guo, Guo-Ji; Liu, Zhi-Hong","https://www.doi.org/10.1159/000508162","20200519",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Police Stress, Mental Health, and Resiliency during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic created social upheaval and altered norms for all members of society, but its effects on first responders have been particularly profound. Law enforcement officers have been expected to coordinate local shutdowns, encourage social distancing, and enforce stay-at-home mandates all while completing the responsibilities for which they are already understaffed and underfunded. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on officer stress, mental health, resiliency, and misconduct is explored drawing insight from reactions to the HIV epidemic over two decades earlier and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. COVID-19 policing is hypothesized to serve as a significant stressor for officers and compound the general and organizational stress associated with the occupation. Avenues for providing officer support are discussed and recommendations for research into the phenomenon presented.","Stogner, John; Miller, Bryan Lee; McLean, Kyle","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09548-y","20200626",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Depressive Symptoms, Body Mass Index, and Physical Activity Self-Efficacy in African American Children","In recent decades, the prevalence of childhood depression and obesity has increased worldwide. African American (AA) children are more obese than White peers and experience many factors that can influence the onset of depressive symptoms. While depression and obesity have been examined in adolescents, there is a paucity of research in AA children. This study examined the relationships among depressive symptoms, obesity, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children. A community sample of 65 AA children completed questionnaires for depressive symptoms and physical activity self-efficacy and also had body mass index (BMI) and BMI Z-scores calculated. Correlational statistics were used to examine associations between variables. Clinically significant total depression scores were present in 22% of children, while 48% were overweight or obese. Overall, children reported high physical activity self-efficacy. Higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher BMI Z-scores. Results also indicated significant correlations between the children’s physical activity self-efficacy and depressive symptoms. Findings suggest that the associations between depressive symptoms, BMI, and physical activity self-efficacy in AA children merit additional examination. Early identification of depression in children may inform future approaches to treatment of psychological and physiological problems within the clinical setting. Screening for childhood depressive symptoms in primary care settings, especially those that specifically treat childhood obesity, can be instrumental in early identification of children with depression. Healthcare providers should be knowledgeable of the clinical presentation of depression and engaged in depression screening.","Williams, Y’Esha V.; Cowan, Patricia A.; Graff, Joyce C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10826-020-01761-x","20200627",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Number of deaths from untreated addiction may rival those from COVID-19","In a far-reaching clarion call for attention to addiction in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pete Nielsen, CEO of the California Consortium of Addiction Professionals and Programs (CCAPP), urges policymakers to recognize that the isolation required in shelter-in-place will fuel even more deaths from alcohol, drugs, and suicide. In The Disease of Addiction Thrives on Isolation, released this month, Nielsen warns that these deaths were already “on track to break records in the number of victims in our state this year,” and goes on to say that those “who survive this year will face a second wave of death due to tobacco related diseases and or relapse to drug of choice unless tobacco is routinely treated in substance use disorder.”","Knopf, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/cpu.30504","20200615",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"On Weakening Strategies for PB Solvers","Current pseudo-Boolean solvers implement different variants of the cutting planes proof system to infer new constraints during conflict analysis. One of these variants is generalized resolution, which allows to infer strong constraints, but suffers from the growth of coefficients it generates while combining pseudo-Boolean constraints. Another variant consists in using weakening and division, which is more efficient in practice but may infer weaker constraints. In both cases, weakening is mandatory to derive conflicting constraints. However, its impact on the performance of pseudo-Boolean solvers has not been assessed so far. In this paper, new application strategies for this rule are studied, aiming to infer strong constraints with small coefficients. We implemented them in Sat4j and observed that each of them improves the runtime of the solver. While none of them performs better than the others on all benchmarks, applying weakening on the conflict side has surprising good performance, whereas applying partial weakening and division on both the conflict and the reason sides provides the best results overall.","Le Berre, Daniel; Marquis, Pierre; Wallon, Romain","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-51825-7_23","20200626",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Cefepime is Associated with Acute Encephalopathy in Critically Ill Patients: A Retrospective Case–Control Study","BACKGROUND: Acute encephalopathy (AE) is a common complication of critical illness and is associated with increased short and long-term mortality. In this study, we evaluated the role of cefepime in causing AE. METHODS: Retrospective case–control study involving consecutive patients enrolled in the intensive care units (ICUs) of Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN between July 1, 2004 and December 31, 2015. AE was defined by the presence of delirium or depressed level of consciousness in the absence of deep sedation. Controls were identified as patients not developing AE and were matched by propensity score for age, Charlson Comorbidity Index, 24-h Apache III score and invasive ventilation use. RESULTS: The total number of eligible ICU admissions during our study period was 152,999. AE was present in 57,726 (37.7%) with a median AE duration of 17 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0–51.8) hours. We matched 14,645 cases with AE with the same number of controls. Cefepime was used in 1241 (4.2%) patients and its use was associated with greater incidence of AE [713 (4.9%) vs 528 (3.6%), p < 0.001] and duration [unit estimate 0.73; (95% CI 0.542–0.918)]. On multivariate analysis, cefepime was associated with an increased likelihood of AE after controlling for shock, midazolam infusion and acute kidney injury [OR 1.24 (95% CI 1.10–1.27)]. These associations were also present after controlling for prior chronic kidney disease. CONCLUSION: The use of cefepime is associated with increased likelihood and duration of AE. These associations are stronger among patients with impaired renal function, but can also occur in patients without renal impairment.

"Mapping population mental health concerns related to COVID-19 and the consequences of physical distancing: a Google trends analysis","Background: The 2020 Coronavirus pandemic is a major international public health challenge. Governments have taken public health protection measures to reduce the spread of the virus through non-pharmalogical measures. The impact of the pandemic and the public health response on individual and population mental health is unknown. Methods: We used Google Trends data (1 Jan 2020 - 30 Mar 2020) to investigate the impact of the pandemic and government measures to curb it on people’s concerns, as indexed by changes in search frequency for topics indicating mental distress, social and economic stressors and mental health treatment-seeking. We explored the changes of key topics in Google trends in Italy, Spain, USA, UK, and Worldwide in relation to sentinel events during the pandemic. Results: Globally there appears to be significant concerns over the financial and work-related consequences of the pandemic, with some evidence that levels of fear are rising. Conversely relative searching for topics related to depression and suicide fell after the pandemic was announced, with some evidence that searches for the latter have risen recently. Concerns over education and access to medication appear to be particular social stressors. Whilst searches for face-to-face treatments have declined, those for self-care have risen. Conclusions: Monitoring Google trends shows promise as a means of tracking changing public concerns. In weeks to come it may enable policy makers to assess the impact of their interventions including those aiming to limit negative consequences, such as government funded financial safety nets.","Knipe, Duleeka; Evans, Hannah; Marchant, Amanda; Gunnell, David; John, Ann","https://www.doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15870.2","20200610",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The effects of emergency medical service work on the psychological, physical, and social well-being of ambulance personnel: a systematic review of qualitative research","BACKGROUND: High rates of mental distress, mental illness, and the associated physical effects of psychological injury experienced by ambulance personnel has been widely reported in quantitative research. However, there is limited understanding of how the nature of ambulance work contributes to this problem, the significant large toll that emergency medical response takes on the individual, and particularly about late and cumulative development of work-related distress among this first responder workforce. METHODS: This study examined peer-reviewed qualitative research published from 2000 to 2018 to outline the effect of emergency medical response work on the psychological, psychosocial, and physical health of paramedics, ambulance officers, ambulance volunteers, and call-takers. Databases searched included: Ovid Medline, CINAHL, Ovid EMcare, PsychInfo and Scopus. The systematic review was organised around five key areas: impact of the work on psychological wellbeing; impact of psychological stress on physical wellbeing; how work-related well-being needs were articulated; effects of workflow and the nature of the work on well-being; and, effects of organisational structures on psychological and physical well-being. RESULTS: Thirty-nine articles met the eligibility criteria. Several factors present in the day-to-day work of ambulance personnel, and in how organisational management acknowledge and respond, were identified as being significant and contributing to mental health and well-being, or increasing the risk for developing conditions such as PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Ambulance personnel articulated their well-being needs across four key areas: organisational support; informal support; use of humour; and individual mechanisms to cope such as detachment and external supports. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between critical incidents and workplace culture and demands have an overwhelming impact on the psychological, physical and social well-being of ambulance personnel. These include day-to-day managerial actions and responses, the impact of shift work, poorly-managed rosters, and long hours of work with little time between for recovery. Mental health issues result from exposure to traumatic events, and the way managers and peers respond to worker distress. Ambulance personnel suffering from work-related stress feel abandoned by peers, management, and the service, during illness, in return-to-work, and post-retirement. Policy, programmes and interventions, and education need to occur at an individual, peer, organisational, and government level.","Lawn, Sharon; Roberts, Louise; Willis, Eileen; Couzner, Leah; Mohammadi, Leila; Goble, Elizabeth","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02752-4","20200703",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Introduction: The Paradoxes and Worries in Contemporary Times","In this introduction, I attempt to map out what I have previously called ‘designer capitalism.’ The way media and technologies in a digitalized world structure existence in what Gilles Deleuze called ‘control societies’ and theorists like Bernard Stiegler continue to develop through an expansive theory of technics, more specifically through his two-volume work on Symbolic Misery. In many respects, this introduction is consonant with Gregory Ulmer’s theorization of ‘electracy,’ which crops up now and again throughout the chapters that follow. Ulmer develops his own ‘electorate transversal,’ a remarkable combination of Spinoza with Nietzsche where pain and pleasure (or sadness and joy) as experiences are theorized within this changed contemporary digitalized world. My emphasis, however, rests with Deleuze and Guattari who play a dominant position throughout this book. In this introduction, I review several important developments to grasp ‘designer capitalism,’ the most prominent being ‘the stack’ by Benjamin Bratton and ‘surveillance capitalism’ by Shoshana Zuboff. Both help us grasp the power of platform capitalism and the place of Big Data in it. This forms a backdrop to my own involvement with South Korean culture and my concerns with (art) pedagogy, technology, and visual media in the chapters that follow. The last part of this introduction offers a hint of what becomes more and more apparent as the book progresses: the questions that surround the Anthropocene, which is explored in the third part of this book, stated sensationally as ‘the end of the world’ as we know it.","jagodzinski, jan","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-48618-1_1","20200704",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, Northern Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study","INTRODUCTION: worldwide, antibiotics are the most commonly prescribed and abused drugs for upper respiratory tract infections. Acute upper respiratory infections are common in children who attend childcare and preventing transmission of disease in health setting depends on actions by parents and staff. Therefore the objective of this study is to assess the parental knowledge and practice on antibiotic use for upper respiratory tract infections in children, in Aksum town health institutions, northern Ethiopia, 2018. METHODS: a facility-based cross-sectional study design was adopted involving 384 parents of children visited governmental health facilities in Aksum town from February to March, 2018. Respondents were selected based on the proportion of nurses in the health facilities. SPSS version 22 was applied for data entry and analysis. RESULTS: the total number of questionnaires was 384 resulting in a 100% response rate. Almost half of the parents had poor knowledge of the use of antibiotics in children for URTIs 183(47.7%), followed by 156(40.6%) moderate knowledge and 45(11.7%) good knowledge. Practices regarding antibiotic use in children with URTI varied. Only 12.8% of the parents did not always follow the doctors´ advice regarding antibiotic use. In this study has reported many areas in which parental awareness on antibiotic use for acute URTI is considered inadequate, consequently inappropriate knowledge and practices. CONCLUSION: nearly half of the parents attending the physicians for their children with URTI expected to get antibiotics.","Zeru, Teklay; Berihu, Hagos; Buruh, Gerezgiher; Gebrehiwot, Haftom; Zeru, Mebrahtom","https://www.doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2020.35.142.17848","20200429",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Designing dynamic reverse logistics network for post-sale service","The paper addresses the problem of designing a multi-country production–distribution network that also provides services such as repairs and remanufacturing. The proposed work concentrates primarily on post-sale service provided by the firm under warranty returns. The proposed model assumes that existing warehouses can also serve as collection centres or repair centres for reverse logistics. In addition, the model also explores the possibility of establishing a new facility. Hybrid facilities are considered because of their huge cost-cutting potential due to equipment sharing and space sharing. The capacity of hybrid facilities can be expanded to a predefined limit to process returned products without hampering forward logistics operations. However, if a product cannot be repaired at the warehouse, it is transported to the plant for remanufacturing. The model optimizes the overall configuration and operation cost of the production–distribution network. The production–distribution model developed in the paper is a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that is later transformed to a mixed-integer linear program to reduce the solution time. The usefulness of the model is illustrated using a randomly generated dataset. The model identifies (a) the optimal locations/allocations of the existing/new facilities, (b) the distribution of returned products for refurbishing and remanufacturing, and (c) the capacity expansion of the existing plants and warehouses to facilitate remanufacturing and repair services.","Mishra, Shraddha; Singh, Surya Prakash","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-020-03710-9","20200708",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is a randomised double-blind controlled trial with 1:1 allocation to either 20 sessions of (1) cgiTBS or (2) neuronavigated rTMS not using connectivity guidance. A total of 368 eligible participants with a diagnosis of current unipolar major depressive disorder that is both treatment resistant (defined as scoring 2 or more on the Massachusetts General Hospital Staging Score) and moderate to severe (scoring >16 on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17)), will be recruited from primary and secondary care settings at four treatment centres in the UK. The primary outcome is depression response at 16 weeks (50% or greater reduction in HDRS-17 score from baseline). Secondary outcomes include assessments of self-rated depression, anxiety, psychosocial functioning, cognition and quality of life at 8, 16 and 26 weeks postrandomisation. Cost-effectiveness, patient acceptability, safety, mechanism of action and predictors of response will also be examined. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was granted by East Midlands Leicester Central Research Ethics Committee (ref: 18/EM/0232) on 30 August 2018. The results of the study will be published in relevant peer-reviewed journals, and then through professional and public conferences and media.

"Sedation with ketamine and fentanyl combination improves patient outcomes in intensive care units","Psychological manifestations such as depression and suicidal ideation are commonly caused by poorly controlled pain, anxiety, and sleep deprivation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. We are concerned that previous analgesic and sedative techniques administered as single-medication approaches are outdated and inadequate. It is imperative that ICU practitioners are knowledgeable in multimodal approaches to pain and sedation in high acuity settings. We have shown that appropriate combinations of ketamine and fentanyl are effective, and if further supplementation is needed, we utilize additional pharmacological agents in low doses and regional techniques that ultimately lower the overall opioid consumption. We acknowledge that a variety of medication supplementations tailored to the patient’s clinical needs and nature of surgery improves a patient’s outcome in ICU and overall quality of life.","Vitug, Sarah; Ravi, Vikas; Thangathurai, Duraiyah","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00275-3","20200710",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"A Performance Class-Based Particle Swarm Optimizer","One of the main concerns with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is to increase or maintain diversity during search in order to avoid premature convergence. In this study, a Performance Class-Based learning PSO (PCB-PSO) algorithm is proposed, that not only increases and maintains swarm diversity but also improves exploration and exploitation while speeding up convergence simultaneously. In the PCB-PSO algorithm, each particle belongs to a class based on its fitness value and particles might change classes at evolutionary stages or search step based on their updated position. The particles are divided into an upper, middle and lower. In the upper class are particles with top fitness values, the middle are those with average while particles in the bottom class are the worst performing in the swarm. The number of particles in each group is predetermined. Each class has a unique learning strategy designed specifically for a given task. The upper class is designed to converge towards the best solution found, Middle class particles exploit the search space while lower class particles explore. The algorithm’s strength is its flexibility and robustness as the population of each class allows us to prioritize a desired swarm behavior. The Algorithm is tested on a set of 8 benchmark functions which have generally proven to be difficult to optimize. The algorithm is able to be on par with some cutting edge PSO variants and outperforms other swarm and evolutionary algorithms on a number of functions. On complex multimodal functions, it is able to outperform other PSO variants showing its ability to escape local optima solutions.","Tungom, Chia Emmanuel; Gulan, Maja; Niu, Ben","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-53956-6_16","20200622",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Eleven-year multimorbidity burden among 637 255 people with and without type 2 diabetes: a population-based study using primary care and linked hospitalisation data","OBJECTIVES: To compare the patterns of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities between people with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) and people without diabetes and how these change by age, gender and deprivation over time between 2004 and 2014. Also, to develop a metric to identify most prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Primary and secondary care, England, UK. PARTICIPANTS: 108 588 people with T2D and 528 667 comparators registered in 391 English general practices. Each patient with T2D aged =16 years between January 2004 and December 2014 registered in Clinical Practice Research Datalink GOLD practices was matched to up to five comparators without diabetes on age, gender and general practice. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of 18 physical and mental health comorbidities in people with T2D and comparators categorised by age, gender and deprivation. Odds for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities versus comparators. A metric for comorbidities with prevalence of =5% and/or odds =2 in patients with T2D. RESULTS: Overall, 77% of patients with T2D had =1 comorbidity and all comorbidities were more prevalent in patients with T2D than in comparators. Across both groups, prevalence rates were higher in older people, women and those most socially deprived. Conditional logistic regression models fitted to estimate (OR, 95% CI) for association between T2D diagnosis and comorbidities showed that T2D diagnosis was significantly associated with higher odds for all conditions including myocardial infarction (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.85 to 2.46); heart failure (OR 2.12, 1.84 to 2.43); depression (OR 1.75, 1.62 to 1.89), but non-significant for cancer (OR 1.12, 0.98 to 1.28). In addition to cardiovascular disease, the metric identified osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, anxiety, schizophrenia and respiratory conditions as highly prevalent comorbidities in people with T2D. CONCLUSIONS: T2D diagnosis is associated with higher likelihood of experiencing other physical and mental illnesses.

"Breath Regulation and yogic Exercise An online Therapy for calm and Happiness (BREATH) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic: A structured summary of a study protocol for a feasibility study for a randomised controlled trial","OBJECTIVES: Objective 1: To determine if it is feasible to conduct an RCT of online Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) for frontline hospital and long-term care home staff under the constraints imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic and need for remote trial monitoring. Objective 2: To assess whether online versions of SKY and/or Health Enhancement Program (HEP) result in improvement in self-rated measures of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and resilience. TRIAL DESIGN: This is an open-label feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT), comparing an online breath based yogic intervention SKY versus an online control mind-body intervention HEP in frontline hospital and long-term care home staff managing the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Participants will include frontline hospital and long-term care home staff that are involved in the management of COVID-19 patients in London, Ontario, Canada. Participants will be willing and able to attend via online video conferencing software to participate in the study interventions. Participants must have an adequate understanding of English and be able to sit without physical discomfort for 60 minutes. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY): The online version of SKY will be delivered by at least one certified Canadian SKY teacher, with at least one back up teacher at all times, under the supervision of Ms. Ronnie Newman, Director of Research and Health Promotion, Art of Living Foundation, USA. The online version of SKY for healthcare workers has a total duration of 3 hours. Phase I will consist of 5 self-paced online modules of 4-10 minutes each to learn the breath control techniques. Participants will be sent an online survey in REDCap requesting that they self-confirm completion of the Phase I modules. In Phase II, 2 interactive online sessions of 1 hour each will be held on consecutive days with a certified SKY teacher, during which participants will learn the fast, medium and slow breaths. For ease of scheduling, multiple time windows will be offered for Phase II. There will be at least one back up teacher at all times. Both Phase I and II will be completed in the first week. Health Enhancement Program (HEP): The active control arm, HEP, will consist of time-matched online self-paced modules for Phase I. Phase II will consist of mindfulness-based meditation sessions delivered by mental health staff. HEP will be an active treatment program that incorporates mind-body interventions.

"Editorial Perspective: COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology in children and adolescents with mental illness","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to have negative health consequences way beyond those caused by the virus per se – including significant psychological distress. Children and adolescents who already live with a mental illness may be particularly vulnerable to the distress associated with the pandemic – due to, for example, fear of the virus as well as the significant societal changes launched to minimize spread of the virus (social distancing and quarantine). In this editorial perspective, we (a) provide data on COVID-19 pandemic-related psychopathology in children and adolescents from a large psychiatric treatment setting in Denmark, (b) give advice on how the likely harmful effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents may be minimized, and (c) propose six lines of research into pandemic-related psychopathology with emphasis on children and adolescents.

"Immediate Psychological Impact on Nurses working at 42 Government-Designated Hospital During COVID-19 Outbreak in China: a cross-sectional study","Abstract Background During an epidemic of a novel infectious disease, frontline nurses suffer from unprecedented psychological stress. This study aimed to assess the immediate psychological impact on frontline nurses in China. Methods A multi-center, cross-sectional survey of frontline nurses was conducted via online questionnaires. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic disorders and suicidal ideation were evaluated. Demographic, stress and support variables were entered into logistic regression analysis to identify the impact factors. Results Of the 4692 nurses who completed the survey, 9.4% (n=442) were considered to have depressive symptoms, 8.1% (n=379) represented anxiety, and 42.7% (n=2005) had somatic symptom. 6.5% (n=306) respondents had suicidal ideation. Conclusions The study showed that the overall mental health of frontline nurses was generally poor during COVID-19 outbreak, and several impact factors associated with nurses’ psychological health were identified.

"Specific cutting energy reduction of granite using plasma treatment: A feasibility study for future geothermal drilling","Abstract Geothermal Energy is one of the most consistent and viable sources of renewable energy. However, harnessing this energy has proved to be a challenge mainly due to the difficulty in drilling hard igneous rock formations that occur in and around geothermal wells. Therefore, an energy efficient method that can drill hard rocks needs to be developed. In this paper, the effect of micro-scale energy delivery, in the form of plasma, to weaken rock by inducing micro-cracks is studied. Two different types of granite (igneous rock) were sampled and used in this study, out of which the one control group was treated with five, 40kV, 80J pulses of plasma while the other was left uncracked. The effect of the cracks is quantified by conducting facing tests on the plasma cracked and uncracked samples and measuring a reduction in the specific cutting energy. Two different methods were used to estimate the specific cutting energy, where the first method considered the entire cutting process and the second method considered only the stable cutting region. The plasma treatment showed a maximum of 65% and a minimum of 15% reduction in specific cutting energy and was regarded as being dependent on mainly the hardness and size of the samples. All results in this study are validated using statistical analysis.","Kazi, Aamer; Riyaz, Mirza; Tang, Xin; Staack, David; Tai, Bruce","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.077","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Small Diameter-Deep Hole Drilling for Hard-to-Machine Metals <U+2015> Drilling of <U+03D5>10×400 mm for Ti6Al4V <U+2015>","Abstract Small diameter-deep hole drilling is indispensable when several main parts of which airplane, automobile, machine tool and metal mould are manufactured. Especially, medical appliances, medical implants and surgical operation tools for brain and bone invariably need small diameter-deep hole drilling for hard-to-machine metals such as stainless steel and Ti6Al4V. The authors newly designed and manufactured a small diameter-deep hole drilling machine by applying technological developments which consist of a direct drive servo spindle motor controlled more precisely, removable steady rests to prevent for a slender fluted hollow shaft of gun drill to be deflected and a highly pressure circulation system of cutting fluid to prevent being clogged with chips. By using the small diameter-deep hole drilling machine and a special gun drill (specially made to order in BOTEK) a drilling of <U+03D5>1.0×400 mm (L/D=400) for Ti6Al4V was carried out. As a result, it was ascertained that the drilled hole has high accuracy in the items of hole diameter, concentricity, roundness and inner surface roughness.","Inada, Hidenori; Inada, Hiroshi; Yagishita, H.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.066","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Direct Wire-Tension Measurement Based Bowing Correction in Hot Wire Cutting of Polystyrene","Abstract The accuracy of parts produced by hot wire cutting of expanded polystyrene (EPS) is severely affected by bowing of the wire. The degree of bowing depends on the current supplied and the feed rate of the hot wire. Bowing occurs when the current is insufficient to melt the foam ahead of the wire and the mechanical interaction between the foam and the wire increases. This causes an increase in the tension in the wire and this is directly measured using a load cell arrangement. Based on this direct wire tension measurement a real time closed-loop feedback mechanism is implemented which regulates the current to maintain a constant wire tension and eliminates the bowing of the hot wire during the cutting process. For a particular feed rate the feedback mechanism precisely fine tunes the current supplied to the wire such that there is no mechanical drag force between the foam and the wire. The sensitivity of the feedback mechanism is high and responds to very minute contact between the foam and the wire and nominally regulates the current variation in the hot wire, hence, maintaining a constant kerf width throughout the cut. This mechanism allows to significantly improve the accuracy of the EPS part even in complex 3D cutting paths.","Karmakar, Namrata; Chetikena, Harish; M, Venkateshwaran; Subbiah, Sathyan","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.042","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Digital image processing with deep learning for automated cutting tool wear detection","Abstract Tool wear is a cost driver in the metal cutting industry. Besides costs for the cutting tools themselves, further costs appear - equipment downtime for tool changes, reworking of damaged surfaces, scrap parts or damages to the machine tool itself in the worst case. Consequently, tools need to be exchanged on a regular basis or at a defined tool wear state. In order to detect and monitor the tool wear state different approaches are possible. In this publication, a deep learning approach for image processing is investigated in order to quantify the tool wear state. In a first step, a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is trained for cutting tool type classification. This works well with an accuracy of 95.6% on the test dataset. Finally, a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) for semantic segmentation is trained on individual tool type datasets (ball end mill, end mill, drills and inserts) and a mixed dataset to detect worn areas on the microscopic tool images. The accuracy metric for this kind of task, Intersect over Union (IoU), is around 0.7 for all networks on the test dataset. This paper contributes to the perspective of a fully automated cutting tool wear analysis method using machine tool integrated microscopes in the scientific and industrial environment.","Bergs, Thomas; Holst, Carsten; Gupta, Pranjul; Augspurger, Thorsten","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.134","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Reduction of cutting forces by elliptical vibration in multi-pass ultraprecise single point axial cutting of V-grooves","Abstract Elliptical vibration cutting (EVC) is an advanced micromachining technology that has a wide range of applications in high-precision micro/nano manufacturing. This technology is primarily used in fabrication of micro/nano-scale functional surfaces, geometrical features, optical and holographic components that are cut in ferrous and difficult-to-cut tooling materials with high form accuracy and surface quality. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the positive effect of EVC motions on cutting force reduction and stabilization. For this purpose, a series of cutting trials involving the fabrication of micro V-grooves by means of the ultraprecise single point cutting (USPC) were performed. To maintain a constant level of the cutting force, an axial multi-pass cutting strategy with constant cutting area was employed. The influence and advantages brought by EVC over the conventional ‘no-EVC’ USPC scenario were initially assessed by means of the theoretical considerations of the cutting force. Following that, experimental generation of V-grooves has demonstrated that the integration of EVC kinematics with USPC motions has the ability to reduce the ‘no-EVC’ cutting forces by more than 90%, to values around 0.1 N for the main axial component. The addition of EVC motions caused a minimal decrease in surface quality whose areal roughness increased from 14 nm in the ‘no-EVC’ case to 16 nm in the ‘with-EVC’ scenario. These observations are expected to open new opportunities in micromachining of micro/nano products, systems, sensors, functional surfaces, and lighting and holographic optics.","Farrus, Nikolai; Joao, Delfim; Milliken, Nicolas; Tutunea-Fatan, O.

"Salud mental y salud ambiental Una visión prospectiva Informe SESPAS 2020","Resumen El ambiente ha sido, desde los albores de la psiquiatría, un factor fundamental en el estudio y la comprensión de las enfermedades mentales. La relación entre genoma y ambiente ha constituido tradicionalmente un tema central en la investigación de la etiopatogenia de los problemas de salud mental y en la concepción misma de esta. En su aplicación a la psicopatología y a la salud mental, la ambiómica psiquiátrica se ha definido como «el estudio de las condiciones y procesos ambientales que promueven la salud mental o incrementan los riesgos de trastornos mentales». Sin embargo, la salud ambiental, al menos en España y en relación con sus competencias dentro del sistema de salud general, ha centrado su atención en los aspectos relativos a los riesgos ligados a la contaminación física, química o biológica del aire, el agua o la tierra, así como a su correlato alimenticio. Aunque los riesgos ambientales, como la calidad del aire, las temperaturas extremas, el ruido, el cambio climático y distintos tóxicos ambientales, pueden desempeñar un papel muy importante, difícilmente pueden ser identificados como elementos etiopatogénicos únicos. Este trabajo revisa la literatura reciente sobre la investigación ambiental y los problemas de morbimortalidad psiquiátrica. Si bien los resultados son poco concluyentes, las futuras líneas de investigación deberían considerar una colaboración interdisciplinaria más ágil, que permita, por un lado, entender mejor la enfermedad mental, y por otro, avanzar desde la salud ambiental «tradicional» a una que contemple los factores ambientales de tipo social abordando el concepto aún poco estudiado de «contaminación social». Abstract Since the dawn of psychiatry, the environment has been an essential factor in the study and understanding of mental illness. Traditionally, the interrelationship between genome and environment has been a central theme in research on the etiopathogenesis of mental health problems and in the very conception of mental health. In its application to psychopathology and mental health, psychiatric enviromics was defined as «the study of environmental conditions and processes that promote mental health or increase the risk of developing mental disorders». However, environmental health —at least in Spain and in connection with its powers within the Spanish General Health System— has paid attention to aspects pertaining to risks associated with the physical, chemical and biological pollution of the air, the water and the ground, as well as to its correlation with food pollution. Although environmental risks such as air quality, extreme temperatures, noise, climate change and various environmental toxicants can play a particularly important role, they can hardly be identified as single etiopathogenic elements. This work reviews the recent literature on environmental research and problems of psychiatric morbidity and mortality. Although the results are inconclusive, future lines of research should consider a more agile interdisciplinary collaboration, allowing, on the one hand, a better understanding of mental illness and, on the other hand, to be able to shift from “traditional” environmental health to an environmental health that takes social environmental factors into account and seriously addresses the still little studied concept of “social pollution”.","Ordóñez-Iriarte, José María","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2020.05.007","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Weak chatter detection in milling based on sparse dictionary","Abstract As one of the most unfavorable factors in milling, chatter will lead to poor surface quality, low production efficiency and tool life reduction. Chatter detection, especially weak chatter detection, is an effective way to ensure stable cutting. In this work, the milling dynamic responses based weak chatter detection method is put forward using sparse dictionary. Based on the milling dynamic equations, chatter frequencies are calculated and verified, which are the bases for chatter detection. With the calculated chatter frequencies, the sparse dictionary matrix can be constructed and the orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm is adopted for chatter frequencies reconstruction. The proposed method can extract weak chatter frequencies accurately. Experimental results shows that the proposed method can be successful in weak chatter identification.","Wang, Chenxi; Zhang, Xingwu; Chen, Xuefeng; Yan, Ruqiang; Wang, Peng","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.121","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

This paper demonstrates the power of the monitoring paradigm by presenting a method of characterizing milling tool conditions by detecting anomalies in the time-frequency domain of the tools’ acoustic spectrum during cutting operations. This is done by training a generative adversarial neural network on only a single, readily obtained class of acoustic data and then inverting the generator to perform anomaly detection. Anomalous and non-anomalous data are shown to be nearly linearly separable using the proposed method, resulting in 90.56% tool condition classification accuracy and a 24.49% improvement over classification without the method.","Cooper, Clayton; Zhang, Jianjing; Gao, Robert X.; Wang, Peng; Ragai, Ihab","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.059","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","Abstract Purpose The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Methods Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M age = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. Results For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.","Dumas, Tara M.; Ellis, Wendy; Litt, Dana M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Process Mechanics Based Uncertainty Modeling for Cutting Force Prediction in High Speed Micromilling of Ti6Al4V","Abstract High speed machining is essential to counter the low flexural rigidity of micro-end mill in micromilling process. High speed machining can excite the higher frequency modes and in addition, run-out is also amplified. These effects in high speed micromachining induces the uncertainty in cutting forces. The estimation of cutting coefficients without inclusion of uncertainty cannot give accurate values and hence, the predicted cutting force and machining stability using these cutting coefficient may not be accurate. In the present work, cutting coefficients have been determined using the Bayesian inference which includes the uncertainty in estimated cutting coefficients. Note that, estimated cutting coefficient independent of chip load and cutting velocity does not include the high speed micromachining mechanics like size effect. The cutting coefficients have been estimated as a function of cutting velocity and chip load in the present work. The segmented cutting coefficients for different ranges of cutting speed varying from 10000 rpm to 110000 rpm has been obtained as a non-liner function of chip load. Bayesian inference modelling for cutting coefficients has been carried out using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. The convergence of prior and posterior distribution has been verified using correlation and trace of samples used for sampling. The posterior distribution shows that there is a good fitting, which accurately predicts the mean of the cutting coefficients. Finally, predicted cutting coefficients have been compared with cutting coefficients obtained from the deterministic approach using least square method. The experimentally estimated cutting coefficients are found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting coefficients with Bayesian inference approach. The predicted cutting coefficients using Bayesian inference shows the deviation of 0.89% and 8.4% at 40000 rpm from experimentally obtained cutting coefficients for tangential and radial cutting coefficients, respectively. The experimental cutting force is found to be lying within the upper and lower limit of predicted cutting force with Bayesian inference based cutting coefficients fitting at 105000 rpm.","Singh, Kundan K.; Singh, Ramesh","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.048","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Summary Background Data During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers are suffering from increased rates of mental health disturbances. Residents’ duty obligations put them at increased physical and mental health risk. It is only by prioritizing their well-being that we can better serve the patients and prepare for a surge. Therefore, it is imperative that measures are put in place to protect them. Methods Resident wellness was optimized by targeting three domains: efficiency of practice, culture of wellness and personal resilience. Results Efficiency in delivering information and patient care minimizes additional stress to residents that is caused by the pandemic. By having a reserve team, prioritizing the safety of residents and taking burnout seriously, the culture of wellness and sense of community in our program are emphasized. All of the residents’ personal resilience was further optimized by the regular and mandatory measures put in place by the program.

"A Machine Vision Based Monitoring System for the LCD Panel Cutting Wheel Degradation","Abstract In Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panel cutting, in-line monitoring of tool wear is important to maintain the dimension precision of finished products and to avoid possible damages to the workpiece. However, limited by the space for camera installation and the miniature structure of the tool itself, monitoring the wear of LCD panel cutting wheel is not a simple task. In this research, we proposed a machine-vision based instrumentation system and a systematic methodology for cutting wheel degradation monitoring. The proposed method describes the degradation of cutting wheel by estimating the tooth height of the cutting wheel blade based on the partially observed random samples. A series of methods are proposed to improve the reliability of the results. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on the field data that is collected from three maintenance cycles. The validation results demonstrate consistent degradation trend of the cutting wheel over production cycles.","Wang, Yinglu; Jia, Xiaodong; Li, Xiang; Yang, Shaojie; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.019","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mechanistic Cutting Force Model and Specific Cutting Energy Prediction for Modulation Assisted Machining","Abstract This paper presents a mechanistic model for analytical cutting force and specific energy prediction for modulation assisted turning. Kinematics of the process is used to analyze the cut surface topography and derive the uncut chip thickness variation for various modulation parameters. It is found that uncut chip thickness is governed by successive spindle rotations and can be represented in the form of trigonometric functions. The cut and no-cut phase durations are controlled by the modulation frequency and amplitude. Cutting (machining) forces are predicted based on the orthogonal cutting mechanics. The thin shear plane angle is predicted considering oscillations in the cutting velocity, resultant effective rake angle and by employing the well-known Minimum Energy Principle (MEP). In order to accurately predict the shear forces, length of the shear plane is estimated directly from the uncut and cut part surface geometries, which incorporates waviness of the surface.

"Clean manufacturing of Ti-6Al-4V under CO2-snow and hybrid nanofluids","Abstract During the machining of a+ß intermetallic stable titanium alloy, their poor thermal conductivity and resistance at elevated temperature accumulates most of the shearing and friction heat. The resulting heat damage the cutting tool, causes in high power consumption, shorter tool life and poor surface quality. Therefore, it is important to choose a latest cooling technique with excellent capacity to remove heat, chips and frictional effects from the cutting zone. Therefore, Carbon dioxide snow (CO2-snow) and hybrid copper oxide (CuO)-multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) nanofluids based minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) are compared to achieve clean cooling/lubrication technique to machine biomedical/aerospace material Ti-6Al-4V. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was applied to design the experiments. Critical machining parameters are cutting speed (m/min), feed (mm/rev), and cooling mode. The output responses are surface quality Ra (µm), cutting power Pc (W), cutting temperature T (oC), and tool life TL (min) were evaluated under CO2-snow and MQL-hybrid nanofluids. Findings have revealed less surface roughness and longer tool life under hybrid nanofluids. While CO2-snow has justified less temperature and power consumption at high cutting conditions.","Jamil, Muhammad; He, Ning; Li, Liang; Khan, Aqib Mashood","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.029","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Paid Family Leave and Children Health Outcomes in OECD Countries","Abstract During the past four decades, most OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries have adopted or expanded paid family leave, which offers leave to workers following the birth or adoption of a child as well as care for ill family members. While the effects of paid maternity leave on child health have been the subject of a large body of research, little is known about fathers’ leave-taking and the effects of paid paternity leave. This is a limitation, since most of the recent expansion in paid family leave in OECD countries has been to expand leave benefits to fathers. Mothers’ and fathers’ leave-taking may improve child health by decreasing postpartum depression among mothers, improving maternal mental health, increasing the time spent with a child, and increasing the likelihood of child medical checkup. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of paid family leave on the wellbeing of children, extending what we know about the effects of maternity leave and establishing new evidence on paternity leave. The paper examines the effects of paid family leave expansions on country-level neonatal mortality rates, infant mortality rates, under-five mortality rates, and the measles immunization rates in 35 OECD countries, during the time period of 1990 to 2016. Using an event study design, an approximately 1.9 to 5.2 percent decrease in the infant, neonatal, and under-five mortality rates has been found following the adoption of paid maternity leave. However, the beneficial impact is not as visible for extension of paid leave to fathers. The implications and potential reasons behind the larger protective effects of maternity leave over paternity leave on child health outcomes are discussed.","Khan, Mariam S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105259","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Deep Learning-Based Intelligent Defect Detection of Cutting Wheels with Industrial Images in Manufacturing","Abstract The cutting wheel is an important tool in the television liquid crystal display (LCD) panel manufacturing process. The degradation of the cutting wheel significantly affects the LCD panel quality. Currently, there is few effective approaches that can detect the degradation of the cutting wheel at the working station for health monitoring purpose, due to the small size of the component and the complex manufacturing operation. That leads to high economic costs in the production lines in the real industries. In order to address this issue, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network-based method for defect detection of the cutting wheels using the industrial images. An end-to-end health monitoring system is built based on machine vision, which directly takes the raw images as inputs, and outputs the detection results. That facilitates the industrial applications since little prior knowledge on image processing and fault detection is required. The experiments on a real-world cutting wheel degradation dataset are carried out for validation. High fault diagnosis testing accuracies are obtained, that indicates the proposed method offers an effective and promising approach for the cutting wheel health monitoring problem.","Yang, Shaojie; Li, Xiang; Jia, Xiaodong; Wang, Yinglu; Zhao, Haodong; Lee, Jay","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.128","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence of Stress, Anxiety and Depression due to Examination in Bangladeshi Youths: A Pilot Study","Abstract An estimated 25% people suffer from mental health disorders worldwide. Almost 7 million suffer from anxiety and depression in Bangladesh. There are several factors that can cause stress among youths, both academic and non-academic, ranging from socioeconomic, environmental, cultural and psychological attributes. However, these are not widely researched in Bangladesh. This study identified the factors that affect the mental health of students due to examinations in Bangladesh, particularly the socio-demographic, lifestyle and psychological factors. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on May 2020 with a sample size of 210 tertiary level students in Dhaka. A modified DASS-21 was used to measure stress, anxiety and depression scores related to examination. Binary logistic model showed that those who lived with family, spent time with parents, had regular sufficient (self-assessed) sleeps and consumed balanced (self-assessed) diets had significantly lower stress, anxiety, and depression. Balanced lifestyle with greater social bonding might help to better equip youths to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression during examination, which could be an avenue for future intervention studies.","Rayhan Arusha, Anowara; Kishore Biswas, Raaj","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105254","20200718",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"5-axis milling of complex parts with barrel-shape cutter: cutting force model and experimental validation","Abstract The manufacturing of turbomachinery components for the aerospace sector is an important topic in machining research. Aeroengine manufacturing companies forecast increasing levels of design complexity and demand in the following years. Key elements are the Integral Bladed Rotor (IBR) parts, such as impellers and blade-disks. Despite advances in five-axis machining, manufacturing a reliable and efficient IBR component is still a challenge. In this work, the mechanics of the milling process with barrel-shape cutter is studied. These recently developed tools offer a potential advantage for a productive, chatter-free, high-performance machining of IBR parts.

"Integrated Tool Condition Monitoring Systems and Their Applications: A Comprehensive Review","Abstract In conventional metal cutting, different tool wear modes, and their individual deterioration rates play vital roles in overall production performance. For a given tool (i.e., geometry or materials), many shop floors still follow a standard rule by pre-setting a tool life, which is conservative but not realistic. Premature failure of a tool can cause unexpected machine downtime and material losses, while another tool could serve beyond that pre-set life. As a result, optimized tool life and productivity cannot be achieved. Moreover, nowadays, there is an increased demand of process monitoring and optimization on the unmanned and the semi-automated shop floors. Tool condition monitoring (TCM) systems for process improvement and optimization have been in research for several decades. Both offline and online TCM systems are invented and discussed. A wide range of original publications are reported focusing on different sub-topics, e.g., specific machining process-based TCM methods, measurement or signal acquisition methods, processing methods, and classifiers. With the recent evolution of smart sensors in the era of Industry 4.0, development of online TCM systems received much attention to the researchers. Accordingly, research on some sub-topics also gets motivated into different directions, such as, feasibility of power or current sensors, machine vision technique, and combination of multi-sensors. Thus, from the industrial viewpoint, the current state of implementation of the proposed TCM systems for (near) real-time process monitoring and control needs to be clear. This paper presents the state-of-the-art of the TCM systems covering three major machining operations, discusses their application feasibility in industry environments, and states some current TCMS implementations. Challenges being faced by the industry are concluded, along with direction and suggestions for future researches.","Nath, Chandra","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.123","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prediction of Stability Lobe Diagrams in High-Speed Milling by Operational Modal Analysis","Abstract Self-excited regenerative vibration or chatter limits the primary requirements like productivity, surface finish and dimensional accuracy of high-speed machining. It is the most critical factor that severely affects the tool-life and life of the machine tool. Out of several methods followed for suppressing and avoiding chatter, machining conditions chosen with stability lobe diagram is the most reliable way. Stability lobe diagrams are typically generated by knowing specific cutting force coefficients and tool point frequency response functions (FRFs). Inaccurate use of tool point FRFs significantly affects the stable regions of stability lobe diagrams. As tool-point FRFs are influenced by gyroscopic effect, centrifugal force, thermal change in bearing dynamics, etc. during machining, it is important to consider the effect of these factors on tool point FRFs in order to generate accurate stability lobe diagrams. The present work covers a new approach for estimating tool point FRFs during machining operations, employing cutting tool vibration signals. For measuring the vibration at the tip of end mill at different spindle speeds, a non-contact laser vibrometer is used. In order to remove the tooth pass frequency and its harmonics from the measured signals, a comb filter is employed. The filtered signal is subjected to Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) in order to derive tool point FRFs. With the estimated FRFs at different spindle speeds, the stability lobe diagrams are drawn for high-speed milling machine. Comparative study of stability lobe diagrams, drawn with static modal analysis and Operational Modal Analysis, have shown that the cutting conditions chosen from stability lobe diagram derived with OMA, are found to be more realistic for avoiding chatter during high-speed milling applications.","Paliwal, Vineet; Babu, N.

"Development of a Vise with built-in Piezoelectric and Strain Gauge Sensors for Clamping and Cutting Force Measurements","Abstract Accurate measurement of static and dynamic forces during machining operations is important in the process monitoring, optimization and prediction of machining quality. Cutting and clamping forces are typically measured separately, for example, through hydraulic clamping force devices and piezoelectric table dynamometers. Since cutting and clamping forces interact throughout machining, both forces need to be measured simultaneously to accurately predict machining quality. This paper proposes a novel force measuring device in the form of a vise with built-in piezoelectric sensors and strain gauges to measure multi-axial clamping and cutting forces simultaneously. A strain concentrating design based on a cross-shaped groove was utilized to attach three strain gauges to measure clamping forces. These locations were chosen for their ability to measure clamping forces in real-time and minimize cross-talks. Piezoelectric sensors were embedded between layers in the vise jaw to measure cutting forces. A prototype of the proposed apparatus was fabricated and used to experimentally investigate sensitivities, bandwidth, clamping forces and cutting forces. The results showed that the proposed device has good performance in measuring clamping and cutting forces in milling operations.","Rezvani, Sina; Nikolov, Nicholas; Kim, Chang-Ju; Park, Simon S.; Lee, Jihyun","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.143","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Comparison of three low-cost techniques to control fogging of sealed eyewear in a simulated operating room environment: A preliminary analysis","Abstract Purpose In the current COVID pandemic, hermetically sealed eyewear is recommended for safe surgical practices to prevent eye contact with contaminated airborne particles or aerosols. These sealed eyewears definitely reduce the risk of contamination of eyes. However, there is a constant issue of fogging up of the inner surface that prevents good surgical visibility which can impair surgeons’ performance and their ability to perform fine tasks, especially in operating rooms with temperature and humidity controlled as per the COVID guidelines. We investigated the effectiveness of surface-modified anti-fog polyethylene terephthalate(PET) films and the application of a detergent-based surfactant liquid, applied to the inner aspect of viewing frame, and addition of filtered vents in the prevention of fogging up of the protective eyewears in a simulated operating room environment. Methods Ten volunteer orthopedic surgeons tested three modifications of a poly-hydrocarbon based hermetically sealed eyewear as a) application of a surface-modified anti-fog PET film on the inner aspect of eyewear, b) application of a detergent-based surfactant coating on the inner aspect of the protective eyewear, and c) addition of two filtered vents/holes on each side of the protective eyewear, covered with an N95 mask cutting. The testing was performed while completing a synthetic bone-based surgical task in a simulated operating room environment of 24–26° temperature and humidity between 40 and 70%, for a maximum of 2 h. The duration to the loss of clear visibility (ability to read a newspaper) and workable visibility (ability to perform the surgical task) was recorded for each volunteer. Results The detergent-based surfactant provided the longest duration of clear visibility (69.3 ± 8.16 min) and the workable visibility was maintained for more than 2 h. The second best durations of clear visibility (31.9 ± 3.75 min) and workable visibility (41.6 ± 5.39 min) were provided by the surface-modified anti-fog PET film. The addition of the filtered vents provided only a marginal improvement in the visibility. Conclusion A detergent-based surfactant coating of the viewing surface provides a simple, inexpensive and effective solution to the problem of fogging of the protective eyewears. Besides this, the workable vision is maintained for a prolonged duration.","Kumar, Arvind; Qureshi, Owais Ahmed; Arora, Rajesh; Kumar, Sandeep; Jameel, Javed; Khan, Rizwan","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcot.2020.07.009","20200717",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Experimental comparison of material removal rates in abrasive waterjet cutting and a novel droplet stream technique","Abstract The use of abrasive waterjets (AWJ) to machine metal surfaces is prevalent through-out industry. AWJ requires the purchase and disposal of costly abrasive particles which increases manufacturing costs and environmental-footprint. This motivates the exploration for low-cost, eco-friendly alternatives. A novel method which utilizes a stream of high-speed water droplets (WD) travelling through a sub-atmospheric pressure environment to remove material without using abrasive grit is presented. In this paper, the efficacy of this new process is investigated and compared to AWJ and pure water jet (WJ) (i.e., without abrasive particles) by measuring the material removal rates (MRR) of each process on a hard-to-machine steel, DP 1180, for equivalent water-flow conditions. Trench profiles are created by traversing each of the jets across a metal sample, from which the MRR and trench profiles are obtained. The MRR results reveal that WD is significantly faster than WJ, but is subordinate compared to AWJ for MRR efficiency. This identifies a trade-off between manufacturing cost and time.","Mitchell, Benjamin R.; Demian, Sohani A.R.; Korkolis, Yannis P.; Kinsey, Brad L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.085","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Determination of Johnson-Cook material model parameters for AISI 1045 from orthogonal cutting tests using the Downhill-Simplex algorithm","Abstract Despite the increasing digitalization of manufacturing processes in the context of Industry 4.0, the process design and development of machining processes poses major challenges for today’s manufacturing technology. Compared to the conventional process design, which is influenced by an empirical ""trial-and-error"" principle, the simulative process design offers the possibility of reducing development time and costs while at the same time improving the process understanding. A possible simulation technique to achieve these goals is the Finite Element Method (FEM). The FEM enables the calculation of the thermo-mechanical load spectrum underlying the machining process. Therefore, different input models are required. One of the most critical input models is the material model, which describes the constitutive material behavior. To determine the material model parameters, either (conventional) material tests, which require an extrapolation into the regime of metal cutting, or inverse techniques are used, where the process itself is used as a material test. Using the inverse technique, the model parameters are modified iteratively until a predefined agreement between simulations and experiments is achieved. The evaluation of the agreement bases on integral process variables, such as the cutting force, and their simulative counterparts. However, the procedure of the inverse determination requires high computational efforts and is not robust. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the robustness of the inverse material model parameter determination from the cutting process. Orthogonal cutting tests on AISI 1045 steel have been conducted on a broaching machine tool over a range of different cutting speeds and undeformed chip thicknesses to set an experimental database. Thereby, the workpiece material was investigated in the two different heat treatments: normalized and coarse-grain annealed. The machining experiments showed differences in terms of the integral process results when comparing the two heat treatments. These results motivated for the development of a methodology capable to determine material model parameters robust and inversely from the machining process, which can be used with lower computational effort. To simulate the machining process, a Coupled-Eulerian-Lagrangian (CEL) model of the orthogonal cutting process has been set up. The material model parameters have been inversely determined using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, which has been modified for this case. By using the Downhill-Simplex-Algorithm, it was possible to determine material model parameters within 17 iterations and achieving an average deviation between the experiment and the simulations below 10 %. Thereby, different process observables such as temperature, forces, and chip form have been used for the evaluation. Through this method, it is possible to determine material model parameters, which enable a good match between experiments and simulations with a low computational effort.","Bergs, Thomas; Hardt, Marvin; Schraknepper, Daniel","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.081","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Feeling Like It is Time to Reopen Now? COVID-19 New Normal Scenarios based on Reopening Sentiment Analytics","The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new normal future.","Samuel, Jim; Rahman, Md.

"Anomaly detection methods in turning based on motor data analysis","Abstract A cutting anomaly can be detected by using machine learning and pattern recognition in addition to the conventional method of using cutting knowledge to determine the criteria of detection. However, it is difficult to guarantee that all cutting anomalies can be detected during mass production due to various events that can occur. Moreover, machine learning and pattern recognition are not systemized for use in mass production. In this work, we investigated the detection of turning anomalies during mass production under optimized cutting conditions. We applied a method that utilizes the motor current of each operating axis to monitor the machining state without affecting the machining process and determines the correlation between turning anomalies and motor data. Our target was the unsteady anomalies that appear in mass production, such as chip biting and tool vibration. On the basis of the obtained correlation, we developed a formalized anomaly detection method using traditional statistics and a systemized anomaly detection method using discretization and pattern recognition based on the Mahalanobis Taguchi method with auto parameter tuning to eliminate the need for detailed analysis based on knowledge of cutting phenomena. Both methods achieved a detection accuracy of over 98%.","Watanabe, Tsubasa; Kono, Ippei; Onozuka, Hideaki","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.126","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Machinability and Surface Integrity Characterization in Hard Turning of AISI 4320 Bearing Steel Using Different CBN Inserts","Abstract The thermomechanical interaction between the cutting tool and the workpiece in any material removal process is a key factor in defining the efficiency and productivity of the process. It is especially important in cutting hard-to-machine materials such as titanium- and nickel-based alloys or hardened steels. The productivity of the process can be defined in terms of machining time, intervals of tool change (due to tool wear) and surface integrity characteristics such as dimensional tolerances, surface roughness and the machining-affected zone. The objective of this work is to conduct a comprehensive study of the performance of three different industrial-grade CBN cutting inserts during hard turning of AISI 4320 case-carburized steel. The CBN inserts all had the same geometry but used different edge preparation and coating technologies. To quantify tool performance, the cutting forces and tool wear were measured at consistent intervals and the surface integrity of the workpiece was characterized in terms of surface roughness, white and dark layer depths, micro-hardness and residual stresses. Results show that the stability of the cutting edge on two of the tested inserts plays an important role in determining tool life (where 60% higher tool life was achieved compared to the other tested insert with unstable cutting edge), cutting force stability and the formation of compressive residual stresses on the surface of the turned workpiece","Niaki, Farbod Akhavan; Haines, Eric; Dreussi, Roman; Weyer, Gregory","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.087","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The training/test data for building the ML models is generated from finite element (FE) simulations. The simulations are performed using the commercial FE package Abaqus/Explicit and validated using experimental results. The FE generated data consists of cutting speed, uncut chip thickness, and rake angle as the input parameters. The response variables are the cutting force and maximum tool temperature.

"Dry Ultra-Precision Machining of Tungsten Carbide with Patterned nano PCD Tool","Abstract Texturing on the rake face of the tool without the metal working fluid is a potential method to reduce the friction coefficient in ultra-precision machining of tungsten carbide (WC) with a diamond tool. Low friction coefficient of the patterned tool would generate less heat in the tool-work interface and improve the tool life. This paper studies the effect of texturing on the cutting performance in ultra-precision machining of WC with a nano-polycrystalline diamond (PCD) tool. Orthogonal cutting experiments were conducted to verify the cutting performance of the textured diamond tool in machining of WC. The linear patterns parallel and perpendicular to the cutting direction were fabricated on the rake face of the nano-PCD tool by using the focused ion beam process. The experimental result showed that the friction coefficient of the perpendicular patterned tool decreased by 10%. WC surface machined with the patterned tool and non-patterned tool was also analyzed and compared. Material separation at grain boundary between tungsten grains and cobalt and full detachment of tungsten grains dominantly affected the surface quality of the machined WC surface.","Maeng, Sangjin; Min, Sangkee","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.068","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Geometric simulation of power skiving of internal gear using solid model with triple-dexel representation","Abstract Gear manufacturing is a fundamental technology for machine production. Power skiving has rapidly become an efficient method for the manufacturing of internal high-precision gears. To analyze the cutting force during power skiving, a geometric simulation of the power skiving process, particularly a visualization of the resulting machining shape and a prediction of the chip geometry generated during the cutting process, is important. In this study, we propose a novel method for precisely simulating the power skiving process using solid modeling. The resulting shape of power skiving is computed by repeatedly subtracting the swept volume of the cutting edge from a solid model of the workpiece. To realize a robust computation in a subtraction operation, a solid model with triple-dexel representation is used to represent the workpiece shape. To accelerate the operations, the parallel processing function of a graphics processing unit (GPU) is used. An experimental simulation system is implemented, and some computational experiments are conducted.","Inui, Masatomo; Huang, Yu; Onozuka, Hideaki; Umezu, Nobuyuki","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.078","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The OMM inspection is firstly applied to measure the comprehensive machining errors, the Hampel filtering, the triangulation-based cubic interpolation and a machine learning algorithm are then used to train the machining error model. Finally, the real time compensation of high-density cutting points is realized by developing the compensation system based on External Machine Zero Point Shift (EMZPS) function of machine tool. The proposed method was validated through three sets of compensation experiment of a thin web part. The results revealed that 58.1%, 68.4% and 62.6% of the machining error ranges were decreased, respectively.

"Comparison of Flow Stress of Aluminum Alloy 6061-T6 Obtained From Chip Pulling Orthogonal Cutting and Kolsky Bar Testing","Abstract Machining can be used as a test for the flow stress of materials under conditions of high strain (e > 1) and strain rate (102/s to 106/s). Constitutive models of metallic materials are conventionally obtained by dynamic compression tests such as the Split-Hopkinson (Kolsky) bar test at lower strain (e < 0.3) and strain rate (103/s to 104/s). To compare the flow stress obtained from both tests under identical conditions, the strain in the primary shear zone (PSZ) in orthogonal cutting tests has been lowered using high rake angle (a = 45°) cutting tools to e ˜ 0.8, and by adding chip pulling to e ˜ 0.5. To our knowledge this is the first time that flow stress estimates are obtained from machining at such low strain values. With some modifications, the strain in Kolsky bar testing has been increased up to e = 0.8, and the stress-strain curve obtained is compared to flow stress estimates from orthogonal cutting tests under the same strain and similar strain rates. The results work, show for the first time, that the flow stress measured from cutting tests agree closely with those obtained from Kolsky bar testing.","Cui, Changlong; Bhavsar, Pavan; Lopez-Hawa, Homar; Madhavan, Vis; Moscoso-Kingsley, Wilfredo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.161","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Influence of cutting fluid application frequency on the surface quality of micromilled slots on Inconel 718 alloy","Abstract Micromilling is a machining process defined by its low dimensions. In general, it is defined by the cutting tool diameter that must vary between 1 µm and 1000 µm. This process is used mostly in molds, medical applications and Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS), where high quality parts are required in terms of geometry, which are absent of defects and possess smooth surfaces. However, there exist hurdles that need to be crossed in order to achieve these high-quality parts, most frequently surface roughness and the presence of burrs. For such phenomena, one common solution is the appliance of cutting fluids. To this end, some research studies have been developed, these have placed their focus upon the different composition of cutting fluid, which is applied with different pressures and at different rates. The application of cutting fluid can be made through pulses, as this is a common configuration for the MQL fluid supplier. The frequency of pulses defines the volume of cutting fluid applied and consequently affects the results. In this sense, this study aims to evaluate the influence of the frequency of cutting fluid application over the final part of the cutting process. The results demonstrated that for the difficult to cut Inconel 718, if a low frequency of fluid, delivered by MQL, is applied, the final piece will not be homogeneous, as well as leaving parts with a low surface quality and higher burr formation.","de Oliveira, Déborah; Gomes, Milla Caroline; da Silva, Márcio Bacci","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.082","20201231",NA,"Elsevier","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Effect of Workpiece Curvature on Axial Surface Error Profile in Flat End-Milling of Thin-walled Components","Abstract The advancements in the domain of CAD/CAM and CNC machine tools facilitated machining of complex geometric shapes to meet functional requirements and/or aesthetic appearances. These shapes combine several geometric features such as zero curvature (straight), constant curvature (circular) and variable curvature surfaces. The components often contain thin-walled sections having inherently lower stiffness that induces static deflections transforming into surface error and violation of error limits specified by the designer. This paper presents a comparison of deflection induced surface error profile generated during the end milling of zero and constant curvature thin-walled components. The proposed framework incorporates computational model to estimate cutting forces, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model to compute workpiece deflections, and surface generation mechanism to derive error profile. The paper also investigates the effect of change in the radial engagement area due to workpiece curvature by introducing the concept of ‘Equivalent Radial Depth of Cut’. Further, the effect of change in workpiece curvature is investigated on the surface error profile in the paper. The proposed framework has been generalized to accommodate the variation of workpiece geometry, and the results are validated by conducting a set of end milling experiments.","Agarwal, Ankit; Desai, K.

"Addressing the Problem of Severe Underinvestment in Mental Health and Well-Being from a Human Rights Perspective","Throughout the world, mental health remains a neglected priority, low on the agenda of policy makers and funders at the national and international levels. While this is shifting somewhat, there remains a considerable need to address the underprioritization of mental health and well-being, perhaps even more so in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, given the history of mental health interventions—which have overemphasized the biomedical model and have thus resulted in coercion, denial of life in the community, and unnecessary pathologization of human experience—there is also a need to ensure that increased funding does not simply replicate these mistakes. This is particularly true in the current landscape, where efforts to “scale up” mental health and to reduce “treatment gaps” are gaining momentum and where post-pandemic responses are still being formulated. As the potential for global mechanisms for funding mental health increases, national and international funders should look to practices that are rights affirming and contextually relevant. In this paper, I explore the current landscape of mental health financing, in terms of both national resource allocation and development assistance. I then outline the momentum in global mental health that is likely to materialize through increased funding, before considering ways in which that funding might be utilized in a manner that promotes human rights.","Mahomed, Faraaz","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200621",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A Key, Not a Straitjacket: The Case for Interim Mental Health Legislation Pending Complete Prohibition of Psychiatric Coercion in Accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities","The practice of coercion on the basis of psychosocial disability is plainly discriminatory. This has resulted in a demand from the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the CRPD Committee) for a paradigm shift away from the traditional biomedical model and a global ban on compulsion in the psychiatric context. However, that has not occurred. This paper considers conflicting pronouncements of the CRPD Committee and other United Nations bodies. Assuming the former’s interpretations of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability (CRPD) are accurate, involuntary psychiatric detention and enforced treatment on the basis of psychosocial disability are prima facie discriminatory and unlawful practices. However, dedicated mental health legislation both permits discrimination and protects and enhances rights. This paper proposes a practical way out of the present impasse: the global introduction of interim “holding” legislation lacking full compliance with the CRPD. While imperfect, such a framework would facilitate a move toward a complete ban on psychiatric coercion. The paper outlines four essential ingredients that any interim legislation ought to contain, including clear timebound targets for full CRPD implementation. It concludes by urging the CRPD Committee to take the unprecedented step of issuing a general comment providing reluctant “permission” for the progressive realization of respect for articles 12 and 14 of the CRPD.","Davidson, Laura","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200621",NA,"PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Depression Detection with Multi-Modalities Using a Hybrid Deep Learning Model on Social Media","Social networks enable people to interact with one another by sharing information, sending messages, making friends, and having discussions, which generates massive amounts of data every day, popularly called as the user-generated content. This data is present in various forms such as images, text, videos, links, and others and reflects user behaviours including their mental states. It is challenging yet promising to automatically detect mental health problems from such data which is short, sparse and sometimes poorly phrased. However, there are efforts to automatically learn patterns using computational models on such user-generated content. While many previous works have largely studied the problem on a small-scale by assuming uni-modality of data which may not give us faithful results, we propose a novel scalable hybrid model that combines Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) and Convolutional Neural Networks to detect depressed users on social media such as Twitter-based on multi-modal features. Specifically, we encode words in user posts using pre-trained word embeddings and BiGRUs to capture latent behavioural patterns, long-term dependencies, and correlation across the modalities, including semantic sequence features from the user timelines (posts). The CNN model then helps learn useful features. Our experiments show that our model outperforms several popular and strong baseline methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining deep learning with multi-modal features. We also show that our model helps improve predictive performance when detecting depression in users who are posting messages publicly on social media.","Zogan, Hamad; Wang, Xianzhi; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200703",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and Emotions","At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.","Li, Xiaoya; Zhou, Mingxin; Wu, Jiawei; Yuan, Arianna; Wu, Fei; Li, Jiwei","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200529",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?","The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200511",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Monitoring Depression Trend on Twitter during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected people's daily lives and caused tremendous economic loss worldwide. However, its influence on people's mental health conditions has not received as much attention. To study this subject, we choose social media as our main data resource and create by far the largest English Twitter depression dataset containing 2,575 distinct identified depression users with their past tweets. To examine the effect of depression on people's Twitter language, we train three transformer-based depression classification models on the dataset, evaluate their performance with progressively increased training sizes, and compare the model's""tweet chunk""-level and user-level performances. Furthermore, inspired by psychological studies, we create a fusion classifier that combines deep learning model scores with psychological text features and users' demographic information and investigate these features' relations to depression signals. Finally, we demonstrate our model's capability of monitoring both group-level and population-level depression trends by presenting two of its applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope this study can raise awareness among researchers and the general public of COVID-19's impact on people's mental health.","Zhang, Yipeng; Lyu, Hanjia; Liu, Yubao; Zhang, Xiyang; Wang, Yu; Luo, Jiebo","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200701",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Examination of community sentiment dynamics due to covid-19 pandemic: a case study from Australia","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lock-down and social-distancing are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression, anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the country-level and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lock-down, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.","Zhou, Jianlong; Yang, Shuiqiao; Xiao, Chun; Chen, Fang","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200622",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 Public Opinion and Emotion Monitoring System Based on Time Series Thermal New Word Mining","With the spread and development of new epidemics, it is of great reference value to identify the changing trends of epidemics in public emotions. We designed and implemented the COVID-19 public opinion monitoring system based on time series thermal new word mining. A new word structure discovery scheme based on the timing explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment analysis method for the COVID-19 public opinion environment is proposed. Establish a""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter""distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.","Zhang, Yixian; Chen, Jieren; Liu, Boyi; Yang, Yifan; Li, Haocheng; Zheng, Xinyi; Chen, Xi; Ren, Tenglong; Xiong, Naixue","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200523",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Detecting Community Depression Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic in Australia","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented impact across the globe. We have also witnessed millions of people with increased mental health issues, such as depression, stress, worry, fear, disgust, sadness, and anxiety, which have become one of the major public health concerns during this severe health crisis. For instance, depression is one of the most common mental health issues according to the findings made by the World Health Organisation (WHO). Depression can cause serious emotional, behavioural and physical health problems with significant consequences, both personal and social costs included. This paper studies community depression dynamics due to COVID-19 pandemic through user-generated content on Twitter. A new approach based on multi-modal features from tweets and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is proposed to build depression classification models. Multi-modal features capture depression cues from emotion, topic and domain-specific perspectives. We study the problem using recently scraped tweets from Twitter users emanating from the state of New South Wales in Australia. Our novel classification model is capable of extracting depression polarities which may be affected by COVID-19 and related events during the COVID-19 period. The results found that people became more depressed after the outbreak of COVID-19. The measures implemented by the government such as the state lockdown also increased depression levels. Further analysis in the Local Government Area (LGA) level found that the community depression level was different across different LGAs. Such granular level analysis of depression dynamics not only can help authorities such as governmental departments to take corresponding actions more objectively in specific regions if necessary but also allows users to perceive the dynamics of depression over the time.","Zhou, Jianlong; Zogan, Hamad; Yang, Shuiqiao; Jameel, Shoaib; Xu, Guandong; Chen, Fang","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200705",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200508",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Centralized and decentralized isolation strategies and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200408",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Detecting Topic and Sentiment Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly influenced people's daily lives across the globe. Emergent measures and policies (e.g., lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease. However, people's mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules. Hence, monitoring people's mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions. On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings. The large scale social media posts (e.g., tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period. In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts. Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period. When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities. Some topics like ``stay safe home""are dominated with positive sentiment. The others such as ``people death""are consistently showing negative sentiment. Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics.","Yin, Hui; Yang, Shuiqiao; Li, Jianxin","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200705",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Keynesian models of depression Supply shocks and the COVID-19 Crisis","The objective of this work is twofold: to expand the depression models proposed by Tobin and analyse a supply shock, such as the Covid-19 pandemic, in this Keynesian conceptual environment. The expansion allows us to propose the evolution of all endogenous macroeconomic variables. The result obtained is relevant due to its theoretical and practical implications. A quantity or Keynesian adjustment to the shock produces a depression through the effect on aggregate demand. This depression worsens in the medium/long-term. It is accompanied by increases in inflation, inflation expectations and the real interest rate. A stimulus tax policy is also recommended, as well as an active monetary policy to reduce real interest rates. On the other hand, the pricing or Marshallian adjustment foresees a more severe and rapid depression in the short-term. There would be a reduction in inflation and inflation expectations, and an increase in the real interest rates. The tax or monetary stimulus measures would only impact inflation. This result makes it possible to clarify and assess the resulting depression, as well as propose policies. Finally, it offers conflicting predictions that allow one of the two models to be falsified.","Romana, Ignacio Escanuela","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200711",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Yet, little is known about how people engaged with these or whether they influenced subsequent mood. We conducted surveys to explore how people in the UK and Ireland engaged with OCSIs, and found that 70% did so to offer support (e.g. to provide company).

To fill this gap, we perform a thorough survey by identifying and classifying the most recent high-quality research outputs that are closely related to the theoretical findings and essential mechanisms of blockchain systems and networks. Several promising open issues are also summarized finally for future research directions. We wish this survey can serve as a useful guideline for researchers, engineers, and educators about the cutting-edge development of blockchains in the perspectives of theories, modelings, and tools.","Huang, Huawei; Kong, Wei; Zhou, Sicong; Zheng, Zibin; Guo, Song","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200707",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Visualising COVID-19 Research","The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200513",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The published academic literature that is written in English and available for access on online databases was reviewed to develop key take-aways and a framework for discussing how to enhance people's well-being in the COVID-19 lockdown. Interaction with other players in virtual communities has been found to have a positive influence on the mental health of those suffering from a lack of societal connection. A framework for further research has also been developed that focuses on the critical situation of the COVID-19 lockdown,as this is an urgent topic with a huge impact on our health.Some gaming service providers have been proactive in redesigning game programming to be suitable for the lockdown situation, and this enables players to enjoy physical activities even at home.","Oe, Hiroko","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200501",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes. An interactive visualization of the ABM simulation is at http://dek.ai/masks4all. We recommend immediate mask wearing recommendations, official guidelines for correct use, and awareness campaigns to shift masking mindsets away from pure self-protection, towards aspirational goals of responsibly protecting one's community.","Kai, De; Goldstein, Guy-Philippe; Morgunov, Alexey; Nangalia, Vishal; Rotkirch, Anna","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200422",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.","Matsuda, Tomoko; Suzuki, Hikoyu; Ogata, Norichika","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200220",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200422",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Global Data Science Project for COVID-19 Summary Report","This paper aims at providing the summary of the Global Data Science Project (GDSC) for COVID-19. as on May 31 2020. COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram data and primary survey data.","Garcia-Gasulla, Dario; Napagao, Sergio Alvarez; Li, Irene; Maruyama, Hiroshi; Kanezashi, Hiroki; P'erez-Arnal, Raquel; Miyoshi, Kunihiko; Ishii, Euma; Suzuki, Keita; Shiba, Sayaka; Kurokawa, Mariko; Kanzawa, Yuta; Nakagawa, Naomi; Hanai, Masatoshi; Li, Yixin; Li, Tianxiao","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200610",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

We find that when observations are serially dependent, the change-points can lead to upwardly biased estimates of autocorrelations, resulting in a sometimes serious loss of power.

"Gravity: a blockchain-agnostic cross-chain communication and data oracles protocol","This paper intends to propose the architecture of a blockchain-agnostic protocol designed for communication of blockchains amongst each other (i.e. cross-chain), and for blockchains with the outside world (i.e. data oracles). The expansive growth of cutting-edge technology in the blockchain industry outlines the need and opportunity for addressing oracle consensus in a manner both technologically and economically efficient as well as futureproof. Blockchain-agnosticism is inherently limited if proposing a technological solution involves adding one more architectural layer. As such, Gravity protocol is designed to be a truly blockchain-agnostic protocol. By ensuring parity through direct integration and by leveraging the stability and security of the respective interconnected ecosystems, Gravity circumvents the need for a dedicated, public blockchain and a native token. Ultimately, Gravity protocol intends to address scalability challenges by providing a solid infrastructure for the creation of gateways, cross-chain applications, and sidechains. This paper introduces and defines the concept of Oracle Consensus and its implementation in the Gravity protocol named the Pulse Consensus algorithm. The proposed consensus architecture allows Gravity to be considered a singular decentralized blockchain-agnostic oracle.","Pupyshev, Aleksei; Gubanov, Dmitry; Dzhafarov, Elshan; Sapranidi, llya; Kardanov, Inal; Zhuravlev, Vladimir; Khalilov, Shamil; Jansen, Marc; Laureyssens, Sten; Pavlov, Igor; Ivanov, Sasha","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200702",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Clinical Trial Drug Safety Assessment for Studies and Submissions Impacted by COVID-19","In this paper, we provide guidance on how standard safety analyses and reporting of clinical trial safety data may need to be modified, given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact could include missed visits, alternative methods for assessments (such as virtual visits), alternative locations for assessments (such as local labs), and study drug interruptions. We focus on safety planning for Phase 2-4 clinical trials and integrated summaries for submissions. Starting from the recommended safety analyses proposed in white papers and a workshop, created as part of an FDA/PHUSE collaboration (PHUSE 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019), we assess what modifications might be needed. Impact from COVID-19 will likely affect treatment arms equally, so analyses of adverse events from controlled data can, to a large extent, remain unchanged. However, interpretation of summaries from uncontrolled data (summaries that include open-label extension data) will require even more caution than usual. Special consideration will be needed for safety topics of interest, especially events expected to have a higher incidence due to a COVID-19 infection or due to quarantine or travel restrictions (e.g., depression).

"Symptom extraction from the narratives of personal experiences with COVID-19 on Reddit","Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200521",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Women worry about family, men about the economy: Gender differences in emotional responses to COVID-19","Among the critical challenges around the COVID-19 pandemic is dealing with potentially detrimental effects on people's mental health. Designing appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society. The findings align with general gender differences in language found elsewhere, but the current unique circumstances likely amplified these effects.

"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people, built environment data, and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The model can correctly classify 56.18% of the sentiments. The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","Rahman, Md.

"Influence of 3D topography on tribological behavior of grinding wheel","Abstract Grinding is extensively used as surface generation process in finishing operations, which makes it imperative that the generated surface adheres closely to strict quality check norms failing which the component will be rejected incurring a loss to the industry. To ensure the intended surface quality falls within tolerances, the grinding wheel plays an important role as an abrasive tool. The finished surface is a direct outcome of grinding wheel topography and its various microscopic interactions with the surface creating a compelling need for in-depth understanding. Study and characterization of grinding wheel topography in the present paper aim to understand the behavior of forces in the contact area. Due to stochastic abrasive grain distribution and quasi-static surface wear, 3-dimensional parameters hold a better physical significance in explaining the nature of microscopic interactions and their impact on the behavior of forces. Experiments are performed in a manner to wear out grinding wheels of the same specification with varying number of passes in an attempt to highlight the influence of varying topography on tribological interactions in the grind zone. The variation in topography at a specific interval of time is captured using a confocal laser scanning microscope and further processed for surface characterization whereas forces are captured using a dynamometer. SEM micrographs are presented to understand the type of wear on the wheel surface. The outcome of present paper enables to understand and report the surface interactions quantified in terms of cutting, ploughing and rubbing whereas surface parameters are characterized as per ISO 25178. The reasoning behind variations during surface interactions was discussed and interpretations were reported.","Choudhary, Akshit; Babu, N Ramesh","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.promfg.2020.05.080","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Patient reported outcomes of breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 outbreak in the epicenter of China: A cross sectional survey study","PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the psychological status in breast cancer (BC) patients in the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple breast cancer centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and included demographic information, clinical features, and four Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) scales (GAP-7, PHQ-9, ISI, and IES-R). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from February 16 to 19, 2020, the peak time point of COVID-19 outbreak in China. 46.2% BC patients had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. 8.9% and 9.3% patients reported severe anxiety and severe depression, respectively. 20.8% and 4.0% patients showed severe distress and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes and close contact with COVID-19 patients as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and CVC (central venous catheter) flushing delay were independently association factors depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak.

"How to deal with the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 for people who pay attention to anxiety and depression","BACKGROUND: The fear of insecurity and uncertainty caused by 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the separation and loss of certain important relationships, and the great changes in lifestyle have awakened strong emotional response, which may cause psychological problems to the general population. However, there are few researches on how the people who pay attention to anxiety and depression coping with negative psychological during the epidemic or major disaster. This study aimed to identify what behaviors can effectively reduce negative emotions during the epidemic. METHODS: From February 1, to March 8 in 2020, we conducted a web-based survey and collected information on general demographic data. The probable depression, anxiety symptoms and coping behaviors was assessed by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized anxiety disorder-7 and the self-made Coping Behaviors Questionnaires. RESULT: Among 17249 responders, 7923 and 9326 completed the assessment of depression and anxiety respectively, and all responders finished the assessment of the coping behaviors questionnaires. Our survey population had a high prevalence rate of possible depression disorders and anxiety disorders were34.66% and 56.93%, respectively. Those who are old, female, low education, low income, and cohabiting were more likely to suffer depression and/or anxiety. Students are a high-risk group suffering from depression and/or anxiety. After adjusting for social-demographic factors (e.g. age, sex), depression and anxiety were positively associated with self-injury, doing housework, and having sex or masturbating and negatively associated with singing, drawing, or writing, dating friends online, singing, attending lectures, and doing yoga.

"Malay Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale: Validity and Reliability","The newly developed Persian Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a seven-item uni-dimensional scale that assesses the severity of fear of COVID-19. A translation and validation of the FCV-19S in the Malay language was expedited due to the severe psychological sequelae of COVID-19 in Malaysia. Formal WHO forward and backward translation sequences were employed in translating the English version into Malay. Malaysian university participants were recruited via convenience sampling online using snowball methods. The reliability and validity properties of the Malay FCV-19S were rigorously psychometrically evaluated (utilising both confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch analysis) in relation to socio-demographic variables and response to the depression, anxiety and stress subscales of the Malay validation of the DASS-21. The sample comprised 228 Malaysian participants. The Cronbach a value for the Malay FCV-19S was 0.893 indicating very good internal reliability. The results of the confirmatory factor analysis showed that the uni-dimensional factor structure of the FCV19S fitted well with the data. The FCV-19S-M was significantly correlated with anxiety (r = 0.481, p < 0.001) and stress (r = 0.389, p < 0.001) subscales of DASS-21. The FCV-19S-M’s properties tested using Rasch analysis were also satisfactory. Hence, the Malay FCV-19S is valid and reliable, with robust psychometric properties from classical and modern psychometric methods. It therefore is a highly crucial and timely addition to the psychological toolkit both in operational and research settings in identifying, managing and responding to the psychological distress engendered by COVID-19.","Pang, Nicholas Tze Ping; Kamu, Assis; Hambali, Nurfarah Lydia Binti; Mun, Ho Chong; Kassim, Mohd Amiruddin; Mohamed, Noor Hassline; Ayu, Friska; Rahim, Syed Sharizman Syed Abdul; Omar, Azizan; Jeffree, Mohd Saffree","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00355-4","20200703",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"“I feel like death on legs”: COVID-19 isolation and mental health","Abstract This study investigates the personal and collective responses to COVID-19, as it is described in personal stories and newspaper reports and examines the social and economic impact of the pandemic on different societies. Although some studies have been done on the impact of COVID-19, these studies focus on epidemiology, the importance of language diversity and reflections on the pandemic. None of the studies so far have focused specifically on the impact the coronavirus has had on different societies because of the global lockdown and restrictions on people’s movements. This study attempts to address this gap in the literature by focusing on how the language used in personal stories and newspaper reports reveal the impact of COVID-19 on different societies by investigating how self-isolation and lockdown measures is leading to mental health breakdown in individuals and affecting wider social and economic collapse. Prior literature (Gortner and Pennebaker, 2003) suggests that the media generally parallel society’s psychological response to traumatic events making newspapers an important collective resource similar to personal stories. The scale of the pandemic is such that it has been likened to a situation of war. In this climate, where the response to the pandemic is analogous to fighting a war, it was interesting to see what effect the enforced lockdown has on people’s mental health well-being and what priorities the media focus on. Smith, Anderson-Hanley, Langrock, and Compas (2005) have shown that language use in descriptions of traumatic experiences can shed insight into successful and unsuccessful coping strategies. I have therefore chosen to look at two different countries, Sri Lanka and Britain in order to investigate the following research questions: (1) Is self-isolation due to COVID-19 having an effect on mental health in Britain? And (2) What are the priorities of different countries during the crisis as evident in newspaper reports? To answer these two research questions, I have collected a small corpus of personal stories from Britain and two small corpora of newspaper reports from Britain and Sri Lanka over a span of one month. The data was analysed using corpus linguistics methodology such as keyword analysis of the two newspaper reports using AntConc (Anthony, 2019) and the personal stories were analysed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) (Pennebaker, 2015). The findings from LIWC shows that the enforced self-isolation is leading to mental health breakdown but that there are also positive emotions of the desire to help and solidarity with others. The analysis of the news reports show that Britain’s priorities are centered on the government’s handling of the crisis and the economy whereas Sri Lankan newspapers focus on educating people about the dangers of COVID-19.","Herat, Manel","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100042","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Modified Bhramari Pranayama in Covid 19 Infection","The Coronavirus (2019-Cov-2) infection Covid-19 is highly contagious caused by single stranded RNA virus (+ssRNA) with nucleocapsid and spreading widely all across the world and responsible for more than 3.6 million morbidity and 0.25 million mortality No specific treatment is available till date. The clinical symptoms are mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure involving. Kidney, Liver and Heart along with coagulopathies. During 2004 (SARS-CoV) pandemic role of nitric oxide in its management is well demonstrated. Nitric Oxide (NO) reversed pulmonary hypertension. Improved severe hypoxia and shortened the stay in ICU and ventilatory support. Nitric Oxide increased the survival rate. The genetic composition of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is almost similar to Covid-19, thus indicates good chances of effectiveness or enhancement in results by Nitric Oxide along with other modes in treatment of Covid-19. It has been proved by studies by serendipity humming increases NO Expression dramatically.It is estimated that humming increases the endogenous generation of nitric oxide level by 15-fold. Hypoxia in ARD Syndrome leads to blood coagulation by depression of body defence anticoagulatory and fibrolytic properties along with metabolic acidosis. If we go into hypoxic hypercapnic state no hyper coagulation takes place. Hence Bhramari by enhancing the expression of Nitric Oxide and increased Carbon dioxide by extended exhalation and alkaline pH prevents coagulopathies and morbidity due to Covid-19.","Taneja, M.

"Frontline nurses’ burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. METHODS: A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. FINDINGS: On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. INTERPRETATION: The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.","HU, Deying; KONG, Yue; LI, Wengang; HAN, Qiuying; ZHANG, Xin; ZHU, Li Xia; WAN, Su Wei; LIU, Zuofeng; SHEN, Qu; YANG, Jingqiu; HE, Hong-Gu; ZHU, Jiemin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424","20200627",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19: Concerns and behaviours in Croatia","OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has created uncertainty that has heightened fear and worry worldwide, thus elevating the potential for a growth in anxiety. This study aims to examine changes in levels of COVID-19 concern and safety behaviours among persons living in Croatia during the period in which the first COVID-19 case was identified and when the country recorded its first fatality. These changes were examined with respect to gender and family circumstances. DESIGN: The repeated cross-sectional data were conducted over two time points over the 3 weeks (N (1) = 888; N (2) = 966). METHODS: Participants completed online questionnaire regarding various COVID-19 concerns and safety behaviours aimed at disease prevention. RESULTS: Findings demonstrate dramatic increase in concern and safety behaviours among participants during the 3 weeks between the first identified case and the first fatality. The results suggest that parents, and mothers especially, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. People with chronic health conditions also expressed greater concern and safety behaviour than healthy participants, but with small effect size. CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of developing clear guidelines for alleviating the negative effects on mental health through effective communication strategies that minimize fear and emphasize positive behavioural change. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? In times of pandemic, people react with elevated levels of anxiety and some will adjust their behaviours in order to protect themselves as well as their family and friends. Some of the measures introduced to protect the spread of the COVID-19 disease have induced an atmosphere of fear, which in turn can lead to an increase in maladaptive anxiety and a greater burden on mental health. What does this study add? By conducting the research in two waves representing two critical time points in the developing COVID-19 situation in Croatia, we were able to trace a large increase in anxiety levels and safety behaviours among the general population. There is a discordance between those who are at most risk from serious consequences of the disease and those who are at greatest risk for maladaptive anxiety. Parents, and mothers in particular, represent the most concerned group, regardless of age. Lockdown measures have allowed us to ensure the safety of those vulnerable for serious COVID-19 illness. Now, we must focus on preserving the mental health of our whole community.","Lauri Korajlija, Anita; Jokic-Begic, Natasa","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/bjhp.12425","20200516",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Phenomenon of depression and anxiety related to precautions for prevention among population during the outbreak of COVID-19 in Kurdistan Region of Iraq: based on questionnaire survey","PURPOSE: Since December 2019, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic has swept the world, causing widespread burden and increasingly hospitalizations. Researchers from around the world have tried to study the virus and its effect with more precision in various fields. The purpose of this study is to identify levels of anxiety and depression with regard to precautionary for prevention of COVID-19, and to identify the relationship between demographic variables and both depression and anxiety. METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study; data were collected by questionnaire via a mobile phone application in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq from 25 March, 2020 to 5 April, 2020. The sample size was 894 after deleting 20 cases because of duplication. The questionnaire consists of three main parts; part one is related to the sociodemographic characteristics of participants, the second and third parts consist of items related to depression and anxiety about COVID-19 using a 5-point Likert Scale (1 = of course no, 2 = no , 3 = normal for me, 4 = yes, and 5 = of course yes). Data was analyzed using SPSS V.25. RESULTS: The majority of the participants were from Erbil (58.8%), most of them were male (58.4%); nearly 21.2% preferred quarantine and 41.7% chose curfew as a best way to to avoid being infected by COVID-19. Most of the participants had depression because of people's lack of knowledge about how to protect themselves from the virus (88.14%), while the majority of them had anxiety concerning shopping and contact with infected people (97%) and financial problems (97%). Females had higher rates of COVID-19 depression than did males. There was a significant correlation between age and home setting and anxiety, and a significant association between marital status and level of education and depression. There was no significant association between other variables and depression and anxiety CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicated that the majority of participants were depressed and had anxiety about COVID-19. There was a significant association between gender and depression and anxiety, while there was no significant association between occupation and income, and depression and anxiety.

"What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?","Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018","20200428",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 leads to jump in people seeking MH help in NYC","It's a stressful time to be a New Yorker. People are stuck at home, worrying about their health, their family and their paycheck, Spectrum News New York 1 reported April 13. “We are seeing a lot of calls related to anxiety and stress that people are experiencing today,” said Matt Kudish, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City. The organization says the number of callers seeking help has jumped 60% over the last few weeks, and that conversations now last about 15 minutes longer than average. The city says it's also seeing an increase in demand. Web sessions to its NYC Well service jumped 185% last month to more than 81,000. “We're hearing from people who are worried about their own physical health, they're worried about their mental health being forced to stay socially distant from other people,” Kudish said. Health care providers predict that even when the COVID-19 crisis ends, the mental health crisis will continue. They say people will continue to be anxious — this time about leaving home and being convinced it's safe to be outside.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32328","20200417",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Guidance for the Treatment and Management of COVID-19 Among People with Intellectual Disabilities","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a pressing world crisis and people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) are vulnerable due to disparity in healthcare provision and physical and mental health multimorbidity. While most people will develop mild symptoms upon contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), some will develop serious complications. The aim of this study is to present guidelines for the care and treatment of people with IDs during the COVID-19 pandemic for both community teams providing care to people with IDs and inpatient psychiatric settings. The guidelines cover specific issues associated with hospital passports, individual COVID-19 care plans, the important role of families and carers, capacity to make decisions, issues associated with social distancing, ceiling of care/treatment escalation plans, mental health and challenging behavior, and caring for someone suspected of contracting or who has contracted SARS-CoV-2 within community or inpatient psychiatric settings. We have proposed that the included conditions recommended by Public Health England to categorize someone as high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 should also include mental health and challenging behavior. There are specific issues associated with providing care to people with IDs and appropriate action must be taken by care providers to ensure that disparity of healthcare is addressed during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognize that our guidance is focused upon healthcare delivery in England and invite others to augment our guidance for use in other jurisdictions.","Alexander, Regi; Ravi, Ambiga; Barclay, Helene; Sawhney, Indermeet; Chester, Verity; Malcolm, Vicki; Brolly, Kate; Mukherji, Kamalika; Zia, Asif; Tharian, Reena; Howell, Andreana; Lane, Tadhgh; Cooper, Vivien; Langdon, Peter E.","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/jppi.12352","20200610",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental health in elderly Spanish people in times of COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. RESULTS: 1639 [150 (9.2%) aged =60] participants completed the survey. The =60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the <60 group [3.02 (3.28) vs. 4.30 (4.93)]; and lower mean (SD) ASDI scores than the <60 group [3.68 (3.20) vs. 4.45 (3.06)]. There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. CONCLUSIONS: Older people has shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women. Economic loss and substance use should be monitored to guarantee the emotional well-being of the elderly.","García-Fernández, Lorena; Romero-Ferreiro, Verónica; López-Roldán, Pedro David; Padilla, Sergio; Rodriguez-Jimenez, Roberto","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.027","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"When Stay-at-Home Orders Leave Victims Unsafe at Home: Exploring the Risk and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The novel coronavirus pandemic (hereafter COVID-19) is likely to have unprecedented impacts on the incidence and impacts of crime and violence globally. This includes impacts to the risk, consequences, and decision-making of women experiencing violence by an intimate partner (hereafter IPV). Most importantly, the COVID-19 pandemic, and its impact on the risk of IPV is likely to differentially impact vulnerable populations, including minority women and those with long histories of victimization and mental health issues. This review paper explores the potential short- and long-term implications of COVID-19 on the risk of IPV, highlighting some of the most recent preliminary data. The economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, record levels of male unemployment, added stressors in the home, including the care and home schooling of children, and the social distancing measures required by the epidemiological response, may serve to undermine the decades of progress made in keeping women and children safe at home. Victim police reporting, help-seeking decisions, and social service utilization during the pandemic are likely to be impacted by stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications for providing safety planning and self-care for victims and their children.","Kaukinen, Catherine","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s12103-020-09533-5","20200606",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Grief and the COVID-19 Pandemic in Older Adults","In few periods in human history have bereavement and grief been on so many people's minds as they are today. As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ravages the world, we have seen many perish in a short time. Many have died alone because of requirements for physical distancing. Even more will succumb as COVID-19 continues to spread. Moreover, deaths from other causes, numbering over 50 million annually, are also happening amid physical distancing and other COVID-19-related challenges. The pandemic is affecting the way terminally ill patients are being cared for, when and how people are dying of other causes, and how bodies are being handled and bereavement rituals performed. The bereaved are required to grieve without the support of usual social and cultural rituals. Grieving is further encumbered by cascading life stressors deriving from policies needed to mitigate the pandemic. Though we are often heartened by human resilience in response to death and other hardships, for some, the burden of this pandemic will be too much. Among other mental health problems, we will likely see an increase in prolonged grief disorder. In this commentary, we review the new diagnosis of prolonged grief disorder and outline why we might anticipate increased rates of this condition on the heels of COVID-19, especially among older persons. We suggest ways we might mitigate this emerging problem.","Goveas, Joseph S.; Shear, M.

Call4Calm, a free emotional support text line, was created to serve Illinois residents “swimming in the stress and uncertainty” caused by COVID-19, Pritzker said. To connect with a counselor, people can text “TALK” to 552020 or text “HABLAR” to the same number for counseling in Spanish. Users will remain anonymous, and the state has partnered with mental health organizations to have counselors respond. Once a resident texts the hotline, they'll get a call from a licensed counselor within 24 hours. The program was announced as the state reached 19,180 confirmed COVID-19 cases, said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32329","20200417",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Electroconvulsive therapy protocol adaptation during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, electroconvulsive therapy units have had to confront challenges such as the infectious hazard due to aerosol-generating ventilation, or the lack of staff and material resources. Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations’ guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. RESULTS: The protocol includes the following main areas: 1) ECT unit's structural and functional; 2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; 3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); 4) management of COVID-19 cases; and 5) protocol assessment. LIMITATIONS: The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT should continue to be advocated as an essential medical procedure. It is recommended that each ECT unit develop its own protocol. This proposal may be used as a reference.","Gil-Badenes, Joaquín; Valero, Ricard; Valentí, Marc; Macau, Elisabet; Bertran, Maria Jesús; Claver, Gerard; Bioque, Miquel; Baeza, Inmaculada; Salvadó, Anna Bastidas; Mencia, María Lombraña; Pacchiarotti, Isabella; Bernardo, Miquel; Vieta, Eduard","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.051","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The harsh realities of personal fears and severe challenges to our mental health evoked by both the United States presidency of Donald Trump and the coronavirus pandemic are described initially. Then, a number of self-care practices that are consistent with the basic values of humanistic psychology and that we can undertake to help us meet these harsh realities are illustrated. Next, the author describes his own personal engagement and self-care in the world of progressive politics and humanistic psychology in the context of the Resisting Trump movement.

Now, however, because of the coexisting COVID-19 pandemic and opioid overdose crisis, the DEA has dropped this requirement. This follows the decision of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to allow exemptions from the OTP take-home regulations allowing stable patients to be given 14 or 28 days of methadone doses, instead of coming in more frequently (see DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID-19, ADAW March 23, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32664).","Knopf, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32680","20200403",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women’s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population – youth to elderly–try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

"Case report of a patient with suspected COVID-19 with depression and fever in an epidemic stress environment","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of suspected cases, confirmed cases and those who passed away from the virus has been reported in major media and the internet, and has caused a high degree of tension. In addition, people’s outdoor activities have been limited, making it more difficult to find outlets for releasing stress. Under this situation, some people began to experience emotions of anxiety and depression. This article reports a case of depression with fever caused by the stress tension of the pandemic. The patient was highly suspected to have contracted COVID-19. The reported patient, who had a history of depression and had been to Wuhan to attend an exam, showed obvious pre-exam anxiety under the epidemic situation, which gradually increased the patient's pressure and then caused some adverse symptoms, such as insomnia, anxiety, sweating and a reoccurrent fever. Local community authorities paid close attention to him and later sent him to a general hospital in Jingmen for quarantine and treatment, as he was suspected of having COVID-19. After being hospitalised for half a month, he was ruled out from having ‘COVID-19’ and was cured of depression and discharged from the hospital. From this case, we can realise that, under the situation of the epidemic, people are easily prone to insomnia, anxiety and even depression. As clinicians in general hospitals, especially when encountering large emergencies, we must carefully inquire about the patient’s medical history while strengthening our understanding of psychiatric knowledge to improve the recognition rate for depression.","Fu, Rui; Zhang, Yueqin","https://www.doi.org/10.1136/gpsych-2020-100218","20200531",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. FINDINGS: We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. INTERPRETATION: Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic. In addition, since HWs often have a greater stigma against mental problems than the general public, it is worthwhile to address the needs of the HWs during this pandemic and to provide appropriate psychological supports for those people at high risk of mental problems.","Zhu, Zhou; Xu, Shabei; Wang, Hui; Liu, Zheng; Wu, Jianhong; Li, Guo; Miao, Jinfeng; Zhang, Chenyan; Yang, Yuan; Sun, Wenzhe; Zhu, Suiqiang; Fan, Yebin; Chen, Yuxi; Hu, Junbo; Liu, Jihong; Wang, Wei","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100443","20200624",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Fear of COVID-19 and Positivity: Mediating Role of Intolerance of Uncertainty, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress","This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The participants consisted of 960 individuals, including 663 females (69.1%) and 297 males (30.9%). The age of the participants ranged between 18 and 76 (29.74 ± 9.64). As a result of the correlation analysis, a positive relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress, and a negative relationship was determined between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The result of the analysis for the study model indicated that there was a mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. Eliminating uncertainty from the fear of COVID-19 will contribute to reducing depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing positivity.","Bakioglu, Fuad; Korkmaz, Ozan; Ercan, Hülya","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00331-y","20200528",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Is investing in religious institutions a viable pathway to reduce mortality in the population?","There is established and consistent findings from epidemiologic studies, among individuals, that religion— broadly assessed through frequency of attending worship services—is associated with lower all-cause and cause-specific mortality attributed to suicide, alcohol, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Religious norms, social support, character, virtue, compassion, love, generosity, and religious community are among some mechanisms purported to explain lower mortality, on aggregate. The religious ecology or characteristics of religion within an area or geographic level (e.g., county, ZIP-code, country), has been linked with overall and cause-specific mortality, but directions of findings are mixed. Mechanisms to explain the links between the religious ecology and mortality included social integration, civic engagement, and social control. The manuscript (SSM-D-19-03928R2) adds a fresh and timely perspective by investigating another mechanism: investment in local healthcare spending. The study found some support of an indirect association from county-level religious denominational composition, through investments in health spending, on Black and White all-cause mortality rates. Should society or government invest finances in religious institutions to indirectly improve population health? This work adds evidence to debate that question. Future work on the topic will need to address several conceptual and methodological challenges. Conceptually, is investigating the market share of religious denominations (i.e., % Catholics vs % Protestants) relevant today given diversity in population and declining trends of worship attendance? Is mortality the most relevant for moving policy or should the focus be on well-being? Methodologically, are there alternate observable measures religious investments/spending in the local economy? Mechanisms, challenges, and opportunities for social epidemiology research on this topic are discussed.","Ransome, Yusuf","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113106","20200608",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Informed Consent for Emergency Obstetric Care During COVID-19 Pandemic","Informed consent process has become a challenging issue before surgery for any emergency obstetric care during this COVID pandemic. There is an increased risk of morbidity if there is a need of intensive care unit postoperatively and a risk of high mortality if patient has symptoms of COVID-19. Admission to intensive care unit adds on to the financial burden to the patient. Also, there is an increased risk of perinatal anxiety and depression during the COVID pandemic. When an asymptomatic carrier develops symptoms of COVID after delivery or caesarean section, the morbidity increases. So we have designed an informed consent form for patients undergoing emergency obstetric surgeries incorporating some points specific for COVID-19.","Tripathy, Saswati; Mohapatra, Satyajit","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s13224-020-01339-z","20200703",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Psychological aspects for the public health emergency operated through counselling psychologists to manage mental health, emotional, psychological, cognitive, behavioural, relational and social impacts are fundamental. And the role of counselling psychologists in maintaining personal mental health and their clients is a crucial indicator of collective wellbeing.

"The Mortality and Psychological Burden Caused by Response to COVID-19 Outbreak: a Hypothesis and a Crude Estimation","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in that country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands for the period of 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. To support the hypothesis on the effect of COVID-19 curbing measures on mental health, we performed literature search on quarantine policy during precious SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.","Yusuf, Erlangga; Tisler, Anna","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Risk Factors Associated with Mental Illness in Hospital Discharged Patients Infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11-22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.","Liu, Dong; Baumeister, Roy F.; Veilleux, Jennifer C.; Chen, Caixia; Liu, Wenjun; Yue, Yongjie; Zhang, Shi","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297","20200713",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 to March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression in 1,103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68%-46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and currently smoking (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower quality of life compared to those without (F((1,1103))=423.83, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Depression is common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses’ quality of life, a heightened awareness and early treatment of depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.","An, Ying; Yang, Yuan; Wang, Aiping; Li, Yue; Zhang, Qinge; Cheung, Teris; Ungvari, Gabor S.; Qin, Ming-Zhao; An, Feng-Rong; Xiang, Yu-Tao","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Interpretable detection of novel human viruses from genome sequencing data","Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.","Bartoszewicz, Jakub M.; Seidel, Anja; Renard, Bernhard Y.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925354","20200130",NA,"BioRxiv; MedRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Adoption of telemedicine services by substance abuse treatment facilities in the US","OBJECTIVE: To describe trends in licensed substance use treatment facilities' adoption of telemedicine and how adoption varies across local factors, including county-level drug overdose rates, urbanicity measures, and state policy laws. METHODS: We analyzed data (2016–2019) from the National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Facilities. Our main outcome was telemedicine use by a treatment facility. We also captured independent variables from other datasets, including estimated county-level drug poisoning deaths and state-level telemedicine policies. We estimated a multivariable logistic regression model to determine which facility characteristics were associated with offering telemedicine. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, an average of 12,334 treatment facilities were included. During this period, the unadjusted proportion of facilities offering telemedicine grew from 13.5% to 17.4% (p < 0.001). In adjusted models, rural location; offering multiple treatment settings; offering pharmacotherapy; and serving both adult and pediatric patients were associated with greater telemedicine adoption (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). DISCUSSION: Use of telemedicine is increasing steadily among substance use disorder (SUD) treatment facilities; however, uptake is uneven and relatively low. As such, telemedicine may be an underutilized tool to expand access to care for patients with SUDs.","Uscher-Pines, Lori; Cantor, Jonathan; Huskamp, Haiden A.; Mehrotra, Ateev; Busch, Alisa; Barnett, Michael","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108060","20200623",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Pandemic brings accessible mental health care to rural Texas","The COVID-19 pandemic has created widespread fear and economic anxiety across Texas, and mental health experts and advocates say rural areas — which already had fewer providers and higher rates of suicide and drug overdoses — could see more severe mental health impacts than the state's urban areas. They are predicting a lingering wave of trauma and depression even after the pandemic's immediate effects recede and lockdowns lift, the Fort Worth Business Press reported June 9. “There's a lot of bad things happening right now because of COVID-19,” said Andy Keller, president and CEO of the Texas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. “But in some ways, people in rural Texas have better access to health care than they'd ever had before. All the barriers to them accessing physicians across the state have been lifted.” In April, Gov. Greg Abbott temporarily waived restrictions on telehealth, allowing mental health care providers and local mental health authorities to broadly expand services and collect reimbursement for online appointments more easily. The state also implemented a mental health hotline in March that offers free over-the-phone support and provides resources and information to callers who need help.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32409","20200612",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Chapter 27 Emergence and Reemergence of Viral Zoonotic Diseases: Concepts and Factors of Emerging and Reemerging Globalization of Health Threats","Abstract The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).","El Amri, Hamid; Boukharta, Mohamed; Zakham, Fathiah; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Panic and generalized anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic among Bangladeshi people: An online pilot survey early in the outbreak","Abstract Background: Precisely how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted mental health worldwide is currently poorly understood. The study aimed to assess panic and anxiety among individuals in the general Bangladesh population early in the COVID-19 outbreak. Methodology: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March 29 to April 06, 2020, involving 1311 community-dwelling individuals aged between 13 and 63 years and residing in Bangladesh. After providing informed consent, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables and using the Panic Disorder Severity Scale and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) to assess panic and anxiety symptomatology, respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: Estimates of panic and generalized anxiety were 79.6%, and 37.3%, respectively. Factors statistically predicting panic were being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, and living with a family. Factors statistically predicting generalized anxiety were being female, being older (more than 30 years), having higher education (above bachelor), being married, being a non-governmental employee. Limitations: As this study employs the cross-sectional and self-reported measures, causal inferences cannot be indicated. Sampling biases may have influenced estimates of panic and generalized anxiety. Conclusion: Sizable proportions of respondents reported panic and generalized anxiety in the setting of COVID-19. The findings suggest the need for additional surveillance of panic and generalized anxiety through longitudinal assessments. Evidence-based intervention programs and supportive services to address panic and generalized anxiety appear important for Bangladeshi individuals during this stage (and likely later stages) of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Islam, Md.

"Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic","OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of insomnia symptoms among Chinese adolescents and young adults affected by the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). METHODS: This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12–29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. RESULTS: Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students’ projections of trends in COVID-19. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a risk factor for insomnia symptoms; as such, the government must devote more attention to sleep disorders in this patient population while combating COVID-19.","Zhou, Shuang-Jiang; Wang, Lei-Lei; Yang, Rui; Yang, Xing-Jie; Zhang, Li-Gang; Guo, Zhao-Chang; Chen, Jin-Cheng; Wang, Jing-Qi; Chen, Jing-Xu","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001","20200606",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"REMOTE WORKING DURING THE PANDEMIC: A Q&A WITH GILLIAN ISAACS RUSSELL : Questions from the Editor and Editorial Board of the BJP","In this interview by email, Gillian Isaacs Russell, author of the influential Screen Relations: The Limits of Computer-Mediated Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy, responds to a set of questions from the BJP. The interview focuses on the impact of remote working during the coronavirus epidemic, starting with the question of whether an effective therapeutic process can occur without physical co-presence. Isaacs Russell shares her immediate thoughts about the virtually overnight changes to our practice that came with the epidemic, and the work of the American Psychoanalytic Association's Covid-19 Advisory Team, on which she sits. Her responses are informed by recent cross-disciplinary and neuropsychological research on the digital age. She considers what happens to free association, evenly suspended attention and reverie when working by phone or online; the loss of the consulting room as a containing physical space for both clinician and patient; the relationship between place and time; and whether (and how) we can maintain a focus on transference and countertransference in the presence of the threat of death. The interview ends with her thoughts on whether we should assume that the landscape of analytic therapy will be permanently altered by Covid-19, and with her hope that general awareness of the impact of trauma on our mental health has been raised.","Isaacs Russell, Gillian","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/bjp.12581","20200709",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and telepsychiatry: Early outpatient experiences and implications for the future","The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically transformed the U.S. healthcare landscape. Within psychiatry, a sudden relaxing of insurance and regulatory barriers during the month of March 2020 enabled clinicians practicing in a wide range of settings to quickly adopt virtual care in order to provide critical ongoing mental health supports to both existing and new patients struggling with the pandemic's impact. In this article, we briefly review the extensive literature supporting the effectiveness of telepsychiatry relative to in-person mental health care, and describe how payment and regulatory challenges were the primary barriers preventing more widespread adoption of this treatment modality prior to COVID-19. We then review key changes that were implemented at the federal, state, professional, and insurance levels over a one-month period that helped usher in an unprecedented transformation in psychiatric care delivery, from mostly in-person to mostly virtual. Early quality improvement data regarding virtual visit volumes and clinical insights from our outpatient psychiatry department located within a large, urban, tertiary care academic medical center reflect both the opportunities and challenges of virtual care for patients and providers. Finally, we provide clinical suggestions for optimizing telepsychiatry based on our experience, make a call for advocacy to continue the reduced insurance and regulatory restrictions affecting telepsychiatry even once this public health crisis has passed, and pose research questions that can help guide optimal utilization of telepsychiatry as mainstay or adjunct of outpatient psychiatric treatment now and in the future.","Chen, Justin A.; Chung, Wei-Jean; Young, Sarah K.; Tuttle, Margaret C.; Collins, Michelle B.; Darghouth, Sarah L.; Longley, Regina; Levy, Raymond; Razafsha, Mahdi; Kerner, Jeffrey C.; Wozniak, Janet; Huffman, Jeff C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.07.002","20200709",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"COVID-19 and Severe Mental Illness: Impact on patients and its relation with their awareness about COVID-19","COVID-19 outbreak has promoted many public health measures in the general population. However, its impact on a vulnerable population with severe mental illness (SMI) is less addressed. Aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID -19 to patients with SMI and identify its relation with their COVID-19 knowledge. A cross-sectional telephonic survey among 132 patients with SMI who were clinically stable before the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. A 23 item interview proforma comprising of self-reported knowledge related to COVID-19 by patients and their illness and treatment status from their caregivers. Eleven patients were completely not aware of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Three fourth of patients were not worried about getting COVID-19 and lacks adequate knowledge to identify symptoms. Two-third of patients lacked adequate knowledge of precautionary measures against COVID-19. One out of five patients lacked knowledge of the mode of transmission and stopped their psychiatric treatment. Thirty percent showed features of relapse of symptoms during this lockdown period. In multivariate regression analysis, patients from lower socioeconomic status, low literacy levels, with inadequate social support showed less knowledge related to COVID-19.

"Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a Large Academic Medical Center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness","BACKGROUND: Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. METHODS: We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, prospectively written by third parties during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay greater than 72 h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychometric testing with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores, obtained within one week of ICU admission, was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. RESULTS: From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up (n = 18) in the diary intervention group and (n = 17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. CONCLUSIONS: Results from psychometric testing demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in care – patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier—prolonged psychological morbidity.

"Validation and Psychometric Properties of the Japanese Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale Among Adolescents","In the context of the global outbreak of COVID-19, there is an urgent need to explore the effects of this pandemic on the mental health of adolescents. The present study aims to adapt and validate a Japanese-version Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) with a sample of adolescent students from Japan. To this end, the Japanese-version FCV-19S, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-A), and Perceived Vulnerability to Disease Scale (PVDS) were administered to a sample of Japanese adolescents in schools. The results of statistical analyses revealed that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a bi-factor model consisting of the emotional response factor and the physiological response factor, with high reliability (emotional: a = .71; physiological: a = .82). Constructive validity was shown by the significant positive correlation between the GAD-7 and emotional (r = .11) and physiological response (r = .25), between PHQ-A and physiological response (r = .19), and between both factors and the PVDS subscale (rs > .16). Taken together, these results indicate that the Japanese-version FCV-19S has a high internal consistency and a moderately good construct validity.","Masuyama, Akihiro; Shinkawa, Hiroki; Kubo, Takahiro","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00368-z","20200713",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Aging and Feeling Valued Versus Expendable During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Beyond: a Review and Commentary of Why Mattering Is Fundamental to the Health and Well-Being of Older Adults","The current commentary and review examines the potentially protective role of feelings of mattering among elderly people during typical times and the current atypical times associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. Mattering is the feeling of being important to others in ways that give people the sense that they are valued and other people care about them. We contrast this feeling with messages of not mattering and being expendable and disposable due to ageism, gaps in the provision of care, and apparently economically focused positions taken during the pandemic that disrespect the value, worth, and merits of older persons. We provide a comprehensive review of past research on individual differences in mattering among older adults and illustrate the unique role of mattering in potentially protecting older adults from mental health problems. Mattering is also discussed in terms of its links with loneliness and physical health. This article concludes with a discussion of initiatives and interventions that can be modified and enhanced to instill a sense of mattering among older adults. Key directions for future research are also highlighted along with ways to expand the mattering concept to more fully understand and appreciate the relevance of mattering among older adults.","Flett, Gordon L.; Heisel, Marnin J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00339-4","20200615",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and pets: When pandemic meets panic","Abstract As the novel coronavirus outbreak spreads globally with devastating effects on human health, pets are also becoming unnecessary victims amidst the pandemic panic. Many have been reluctantly left home alone by owners who have been forced to temporarily evacuate their homes. And, although no evidence exists to indicate that they can either transmit the virus or develop its associated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), fear among the public that pets might play a role in spreading COVID-19 has resulted in pets being abandoned or even killed. This article outlines some of the ways in which the current pandemic has negatively impacted the welfare of pets. It also highlights the relationships between animal, human, and environmental health, as well as the importance of taking a collaborative transdisciplinary One Health approach to help prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks.","Parry, Nicola M.A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsir.2020.100090","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the Covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.","El Haj, Mohamad; Altintas, Emin; Chapelet, Guillaume; Kapogiannis, Dimitrios; Gallouj, Karim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200713",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Associations Between Fear of COVID-19, Mental Health, and Preventive Behaviours Across Pregnant Women and Husbands: An Actor-Partner Interdependence Modelling","The present cross-sectional study examined the actor-partner interdependence effect of fear of COVID-19 among Iranian pregnant women and their husbands and its association with their mental health and preventive behaviours during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. A total of 290 pregnant women and their husbands (N = 580) were randomly selected from a list of pregnant women in the Iranian Integrated Health System and were invited to respond to psychometric scales assessing fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. The findings demonstrated significant dyadic relationships between husbands and their pregnant wives' fear of COVID-19, mental health, and preventive behaviours. Pregnant wives’ actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours but not anxiety. Moreover, a husband actor effect of fear of COVID-19 was significantly associated with depression, anxiety, suicidal intention, mental quality of life, and COVID-19 preventive behaviours. Additionally, there were significant partner effects observed for both the pregnant wives and their husbands concerning all outcomes. The present study used a cross-sectional design and so is unable to determine the mechanism or causal ordering of the effects. Also, the data are mainly based on self-reported measures which have some limitations due to its potential for social desirability and recall biases. Based on the findings, couples may benefit from psychoeducation that focuses on the effect of mental health problems on pregnant women and the foetus.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi; Imani, Vida; Lin, Chung-Ying; Timpka, Toomas; Broström, Anders; Updegraff, John A.; Årestedt, Kristofer; Griffiths, Mark D.; Pakpour, Amir H.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00340-x","20200611",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Rethinking ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’: the developmental paediatrician’s COVID-19 response","While terms such as ‘essential’ and ‘nonessential’ used amidst the COVID-19 pandemic may serve a practical purpose, they also pose a risk of obstructing our view of the harmful indirect health consequences of this crisis. SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths in children are minimal compared to adults, but the pandemic impacts other ‘essential’ aspects of children’s health including child development and the associated areas of paediatric behaviour, mental health, and maltreatment. Alongside the management of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases in emergency rooms and intensive care units, continuing to care for children with developmental disabilities must also be concurrently championed as ‘essential’ during this crisis. The potentially devastating lifelong effects of the pandemic and isolation on an already vulnerable population demand that action be taken now. Video conferences and phone calls are ‘essential’ instruments we can use to continue to provide quality care for our patients.","Fung, Alastair; Ricci, M Florencia","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pch/pxaa077","20200620",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Experiences of American older adults with pre-existing depression during the beginnings of the COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-city, mixed-methods study","OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: During the first two months of the pandemic, we interviewed participants with a semi-structured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. We also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: (1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. (2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. (3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. (4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. (5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.","Hamm, Megan E.; Brown, Patrick J.; Karp, Jordan F.; Lenard, Emily; Cameron, Flor; Dawdani, Alicia; Lavretsky, Helen; Miller, J.

"L’optimisme et COVID-19: une ressource pour soutenir les personnes en situation de confinement?","Abstract This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.","Martin-Krumm, Charles; Tarquinio, Cyril; Tarquinio, Camille","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200605",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"North Carolina frees up $30 million for BH during COVID-19 crisis","North Carolina's seven regional managed care agencies for behavioral health are receiving $30 million so they can keep a variety of programs running during the COVID-19 crisis, Carolina Public Press reported March 31. The money, which an N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said represented unused Medicaid funds, has been shifted to the state's seven local management entities/managed care organizations, commonly called LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high-quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID-19 cases rises.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32310","20200403",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Cutting Cubes Out of Fog: The Whole View of Design","Abstract In this article we argue that the field of design evolved to include helping organizations address complex problems in the face of uncertainty, but it has yet to build knowledge in a way that formalizes the various activities embraced by the field. We use our relationship with the school of public health at Harvard to illustrate the advantages of formalizing design knowledge more explicitly. We introduce the Whole View model to provide the field of design with a tentative structure for its knowledge that could make it easier for design and other fields to work together. We situate the model in the context of different types of design education, and show examples of how the Whole View provides a structure for teaching, research, and practice. We conclude by introducing a new agenda for design centered on the well-being of people, organizations, and the natural environment, with health, happiness, and prosperity as the levers driving change.","Whitney, Patrick; Nogueira, André","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sheji.2020.04.001","20200831",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Gambling harm is everybody's business: A public health approach and call to action","There is a growing consensus that gambling is a public health issue and that preventing gambling related harms requires a broad response. Although many policy decisions regarding gambling are made at a national level in the UK, there are clear opportunities to take action at local and regional levels to prevent the negative impacts on individuals, families and local communities. This response goes beyond the statutory roles of licencing authorities to include amongst others the National Health Service (NHS), the third sector, mental health services, homelessness and housing services, financial inclusion support. As evidence continues to emerge to strengthen the link between gambling and a wide range of risk factors and negative consequences, there is also a strong correlation with health inequalities. Because the North of England experiences increasing health inequalities, it offers an opportunity as a specific case study to share learning on reducing gambling-related harms within a geographic area. This article describes an approach to gambling as a public health issue identifying it as needing a cross-cutting, systemwide multisectoral approach to be taken at local and regional levels. Challenges at national and local levels require policy makers to adopt a ‘health in all policy’ approach and use the best evidence in their future decisions to prevent harm. A whole systems approach which aims to reduce poverty and health inequalities needs to incorporate gambling harm within place-based planning and draws on the innovative opportunities that exist to engage local stakeholders, builds local leadership and takes a collaborative approach to tackling gambling-related harms. This whole systems approach includes the following: (1) understanding the prevalence of gambling related harms with insights into the consequences and how individuals, their family and friends and wider community are affected; (2) ensuring tackling gambling harms is a key public health commitment at all levels by including it in strategic plans, with meaningful outcome measures, and communicating this to partners; (3) understanding the assets and resources available in the public, private and voluntary sectors and identifying what actions are underway; (4) raising awareness and sharing data, developing a compelling narrative and involving people who have been harmed and are willing to share their experience; (5) ensuring all regulatory authorities help tackle gambling-related harms under a ‘whole council’ approach.","Johnstone, P.; Regan, M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2020.06.010","20200717",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The digital clinic: Implementing technology and augmenting care for mental health","Increasing both access to and quality of mental healthcare is a global priority. One solution is to integrate technologies such as smartphone apps and sensors directly into care. Acknowledging many prior attempts and barriers, we introduce the Digital Clinic which is an already functioning clinic using smartphone apps to augment and extend care today at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) in Boston, Massachusetts. In this piece, we outline the theoretical foundation of the Digital Clinic and its emphasis on the therapeutic alliance, measurement-based care, and shared decision making. We explore both workflow and engagement challenges as well as solutions including a new care team member, the Digital Navigator, and the customization of technology. Acknowledging that the Digital Clinic is an evolving program, we offer details on our implementation in order to allow others to replicate, expand on, and improve these initial efforts.","Rodriguez-Villa, Elena; Rauseo-Ricupero, Natali; Camacho, Erica; Wisniewski, Hannah; Keshavan, Matcheri; Torous, John","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.06.009","20200630",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Effect of state regulatory environments on advanced psychiatric nursing practice()","The first key message in the landmark Future of Nursing report is that “Nurses should practice to the full extent of their education and training” (Institute of Medicine, 2011). Although there has been significant progress across states to remove or diminish barriers to the exercise of full scope of practice by advanced practice registered nurses (APRN), state regulations continue to unnecessarily restrict APRN practice in most of the United States. This article integrates data from studies that examine how state and local regulation affects psychiatric mental health APRN practice with the literature on how state scope of practice regulation affects the size and distribution of the broader APRN workforce, access to care, health care costs and prices, and innovation in health care service delivery. Common themes include confusion about regulatory requirements and mixed experiences of mandated physician supervision.","Phoenix, Bethany J.; Chapman, Susan A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apnu.2020.07.001","20200709",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

University students may be particularly vulnerable to mental health problems, but recent studies have indicated only a negligible impact of confinement strategies. French respondents to a World Mental Health survey of university students completed questions concerning Covid-19 confinement. The sample experienced increased anxiety as well as moderate to severe stress during confinement. Respondents who did not relocate to live with parents were disproportionately affected.

A total of 1,172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8–18 years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Yumei; Duan, Wenjie; Chen, Zheng","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105235","20200708",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

An online survey was conducted from 1 May to 8 May 2020 to collect the information. A structural questionnaire link using ‘Google form’ was sent to students’ through WhatsApp and E-mail. A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic.

"Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in a US College Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted college students’ coursework, stress levels, and perceived health. Various estimates indicate that high proportions of college students have experienced increased amounts of stress (Dziech, Inside Higher Education, 2020; Hartocollis, New York Times, 2020), yet other sources indicate that many college students respond to these changes with resilience (Kelley, Cornell Chronicle, 2020). A method for assessing student anxiety regarding the pandemic is thus needed. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) (Ahorsu et al., International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, 2020) is a seven-item scale which has been validated and shown to possess good psychometric qualities in studies of participants from multiple countries. The current study used a cross-sectional convenience sample of US college student participants (n = 237) and found that the FCV-19S has high reliability and validity as demonstrated by its internal consistency and strong one-factor solution. Scores on the FCV-19S were positively correlated with anxiety for students who were married or of Asian descent. Additionally, the FCV-19S was only moderately correlated with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), suggesting that the FCV-19S may bring added utility to research and clinical practice with populations impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Perz, Catherine A.; Lang, Brent A.; Harrington, Rick","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00356-3","20200625",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

In some cases, these psychic losses lasted for many months after the end of this confinement CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to develop and implement actions to minimize the population psychological distress in meeting the needs of the communities affected by COVID-19 Thus, as it occurred in China, it is necessary that the other affected nations promote the publication of regulations that guide the implementation of mental health services and the allocation of resources, in order to ensure that individuals are monitored by competent professionals, thus reducing the psychological damage that can be motivated by the social isolation period during the quarantine.","de Lima, Carlos Victor Chaves; Cândido, Estelita Lima; da Silva, José Arinelson; Albuquerque, Letícia Viana; Soares, Lívia de Menezes; do Nascimento, Mayara Maciel; de Oliveira, Sara Alves; Neto, Modesto Leite Rolim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.063","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological influence of Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the general public, medical workers and patients with mental disorders and its countermeasures","Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency (PHEIC) of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by (WHO) of the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020 showed that general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg). Therefore, while controlling the pandemic, the government should also pay attention to the mental health of the general public, medical workers and patients with mental disorders.

"Navigating crisis from the backseat? How top managers can support radical change initiatives by middle managers","Abstract We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.","Heyden, Mariano L.M.; Wilden, Ralf; Wise, Chelsea","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024","20200731",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Circulating endocannabinoid concentrations in grieving adults","Bereavement is one of the most intense, distressing, and traumatic events an elderly person will experience. The symptom responses to bereavement vary, particularly during the first year. However, the neurobiology underlying the symptom variance in grief is poorly understood. The endocannabinoid signaling (ECS) system is stress-responsive; mounting evidence implicates abnormalities in the central ECS system could contribute to psychopathology. The current study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the ECS is abnormal in grief, using circulating eCB concentrations as a biomarker of central ECS. A predominantly older sample of grief participants, within 13 months following the death of a loved one, and healthy comparison (HC) participants were studied. Associations of circulating eCBs with symptom variance in grievers were also examined. A total of 61 (grief: n = 44; HC: n = 17) adults completed cross-sectional clinical assessments and a fasting blood draw. Assessments included the Inventory of Complicated Grief scale; the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; and the Hamilton Anxiety scale. Serum eCB concentrations (i.e., N-arachidonoylethanolamine [AEA] and 2-arachidonoylglycerol [2-AG]) were quantified using isotope dilution, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Relative to HC participants, grievers had significantly elevated serum AEA but similar 2-AG concentrations. In grievers, serum AEA concentrations were positively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms, but only in those with low grief symptoms. These novel findings indicate that elevated circulating eCB concentrations are found following bereavement. The eCB signaling response varies based on the degree of grief severity. Circulating eCB measures may have the potential to serve as biomarkers of prolonged grief disorder.","Harfmann, Elisabeth J.; McAuliffe, Timothy L.; Larson, Eric R.; Claesges, Stacy A.; Sauber, Garrett; Hillard, Cecilia J.; Goveas, Joseph S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104801","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence of Anxiety and Depression symptom, and the Demands for Psychological Knowledge and Interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large Cross-Sectional Study","BACKGROUND: : Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. METHODS: : A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. RESULTS: : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P=0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P=0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). LIMITATIONS: : All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. CONCLUSIONS: : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.","Wang, Zheng-He; Yang, Hai-Lian; Yang, Yun-Qing; Liu, Dan; Li, Zhi-Hao; Zhang, Xi-Ru; Zhang, Yu-Jie; Shen, Dong; Chen, Pei-Liang; Song, Wei-Qi; Wang, Xiao-Meng; Wu, Xian-Bo; Yang, Xing-Fen; Mao, Chen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.034","20200702",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Gaucher Disease patients in Spain: Time to reconsider home-based therapies?","OBJECTIVE: An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here. PATIENTS & METHODS: The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent. RESULTS: 110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were = 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died. CONCLUSIONS: One quarter of the patients treated at hospitals reported dose interruptions.

"Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study","BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. METHOD: Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. RESULTS: In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control. CONCLUSIONS: The results emphasize the protective effect of PMH in extraordinary situations such as the current outbreak of COVID-19.","Brailovskaia, Julia; Margraf, Jürgen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijchp.2020.06.002","20200628",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Managing Mass Fatalities during COVID-19: Lessons for Promoting Community Resilience During Global Pandemics","In the United States and around the world, COVID-19 represents a mass fatality incident, as there are more bodies than can be handled using existing resources. Although the management and disposition of bodies is distressing and heartrending, it is a task that local, state, and federal governments must plan for and respond to collaboratively with the private sector and faith-based community. When mass fatalities are mismanaged, there are grave emotional and mental health consequences that can delay recovery and undermine community resilience. Using insights from one of the author's mass fatality management research during the 2010 Haiti earthquake, this article explores how mass fatalities are being managed in response to COVID-19. Based on the researcher's findings a decade ago, it is apparent that many lessons have not been learnt. This article concludes by providing governments with practical lessons on how to manage mass fatalities to facilitate and promote community resilience.","Entress, Rebecca; Tyler, Jenna; Sadiq, Abdul-Akeem","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/puar.13232","20200519",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Introduction: changing cultures of speed","This chapter outlines the widespread acceptance of speed as a positive aspect of urban transport during the 20th century, along with a growing recognition in recent decades that speed may not provide the advantages that have long been assumed. In 21st century urban planning, no longer are higher speeds always seen as the main objective. New goals are increasingly recognised as being more important: accessibility, liveability, economic vitality, child-friendliness, sustainability and health. The concept of ‘health’ in this book applies to human health, as well as economic health and environmental health. We explain how all of these types of health can be enhanced using the simple strategy of slowing city transport. A brief history of increases in transport speed is followed by a discussion of the evolution of the culture of speed in modern societies, to a level that can be compared to an addiction. An important aspect of the culture of speed is the story of motordom, the grouping of automobile clubs, car dealers and car manufacturers that began in the United States in the 1920s. A concerted campaign by motordom comprehensively dismissed the public’s negative views on speed. We then outline how, from the 1980s onwards, new thinking began to emerge about motorised city transport, in which the value of slowing it down became more widely discussed. We provide examples of various slow movements that have emerged since the 1980s. While some citizens and policy-makers may question (or even ridicule) the idea of slow movements, we reflect on where the ‘fast movement’ has taken us over the last 100 years. This chapter concludes with a preview of the chapters and parts of the book.","Tranter, Paul; Tolley, Rodney","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-815316-1.00001-0","20200626",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Mental Health Crises in Rural and Remote Australia: An Assessment of Direct Medical Costs of Air Medical Retrievals and the Implications for the Societal Burden","OBJECTIVE: Adequate mental health service provision in rural and remote Australian communities is problematic because of the tyranny of distance. The Royal Flying Doctor Service provides air medical retrieval for people in rural and remote areas. The economic impact on both the Royal Flying Doctor Service and the public hospital system for mental health–related air medical retrievals is unknown. We aimed to estimate the direct medical costs associated with air medical retrievals and subsequent hospitalizations for mental and behavioral disorders for the 2017 calendar year. METHODS: All patients with a primary working diagnosis of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Version, Australian Modification F00 to F99 (mental and behavioral disorders) who underwent an air medical retrieval were included in this cost analysis. International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Edition, Australian Modification codes were mapped to Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Group codes, with hospital costs applied from the National Hospital Cost Data Collection (2016/2017). All costs are reported in 2017 Australian dollars (AUDs). RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two primary evacuations and 926 interhospital transfers occurred with an in-flight diagnosis of F00 to F99, most commonly psychotic disorders, including schizophrenia and schizotypal disorders. The total direct medical costs were estimated to be AUD $20,070,527. Costs for primary evacuations accounted for 13% (AUD $2,611,260), with the majority of this associated with the subsequent hospital admission (AUD $1,770,139). Similarly, the majority of the costs associated with interhospital transfers (total costs = AUD $17,459,267) were also related to hospital costs (AUD $13,569,187). CONCLUSION: Direct medical costs associated with air medical retrievals for people experiencing a mental health crisis are substantial.

After presenting a conceptual framework on the mechanisms through which economic crises affect mental health, we describe the main results of 45 papers identified in our search. Studies indicate a worsening of mental health in Spain in the years of economic crisis, especially in men. Working conditions (unemployment, low wages, instability, precariousness) emerge as one of the main channels through which mental health is put at risk or deteriorates. This deterioration occurs with intensity in particularly vulnerable groups, such as immigrant population and families with economic burdens. In the case of suicides, the results were inconclusive. Regarding the use of health care services, an increase in the consumption of certain drugs seems to be identified, although the conclusions of all the studies are not coincidental. Social inequalities in mental health do not seem to have remitted. We conclude that Spain needs to improve information systems to a better understanding of the health effects of economic crises. In terms of public policies, together with the reinforcement of health services aimed at addressing mental health problems, an income guarantee network for people in vulnerable situations should be promoted, as well as the development of policies aimed at the labour market.","Oliva, Juan; López-Varcárcel, Beatriz González; Pérez, Patricia Barber; Peña-Longobardo, Luz María; Garrido, Rosa M.

"The Nature and Treatment of Pandemic-Related Psychological Distress","The COVID-19 crisis has created a “mental health pandemic” throughout the world. Scientific data are not available to fully understand the nature of the resulting mental health impact given the very recent onset of the pandemic, nevertheless, there is a need to act immediately to develop psychotherapeutic strategies that may alleviate pandemic-related distress. The psychological distress, in particular fear and sadness, is a function of the pandemic’s negative impact upon people’s ability to meet their most basic needs (e.g., physical safety, financial security, social connection, participation in meaningful activities). This paper presents evidence-based cognitive behavioral strategies that should prove useful in reducing the emotional suffering associated with the COVID crisis.","Sanderson, William C.; Arunagiri, Vinushini; Funk, Allison P.; Ginsburg, Karen L.; Krychiw, Jacqueline K.; Limowski, Anne R.; Olesnycky, Olenka S.; Stout, Zoe","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10879-020-09463-7","20200627",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"University students’ changes in mental health status and determinants of behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","INTRODUCTION: : The aim of the study was to investigate mental health in university students in Greece, during lockdown due to COVID-19. MATERIAL AND METHODS: : The data were collected online and anonymously, during lockdown; they included 1104 females (aged 22.08±4,96) and 431 males (aged 22.35±3.11). The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios RESULTS: : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2-5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20-68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. DISCUSSION: : The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs. Further targeted research is necessary as well as targeted intervention in vulnerable groups but concerning mental health as well as the reduction of believing in conspiracy theories.","Patsali, Mikaella E.; Mousa, Danai-Priskila V.; Papadopoulou, Eleni V.K.; Papadopoulou, Konstantina K.K.; Kaparounaki, Chrysi K.; Diakogiannis, Ioannis; Fountoulakis, Konstantinos N","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113298","20200713",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.","Noorbhai, Habib","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200711",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Evans Jr., Ph.D., APA's CEO, said in a statement. “The federal government has just identified psychologists as critical, essential workers in the U.S. response to COVID-19. But this does not mean that psychologists and psychology trainees must do work in person,” he said. “Essential psychological services can, and in many cases, should be delivered through telehealth. It is critically important that psychologists are able to meet the needs of their patients and communities during this difficult time, without further increasing the risk of contagion.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32297","20200327",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Isolation of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: An ethical, legal, and practical challenge","Psychiatric inpatients are particularly vulnerable to the transmission and effects of COVID-19. As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual's right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation. We then interrogate the practicality of currently available approaches by applying them to a series of hypothetical cases. There are currently no ‘neat’ or practicable solutions to the problem of lawfully isolating patients on mental health units, and we discuss the myriad issues with both mental health and public health law approaches to the problem. We conclude by making some suggestions to policymakers.","Brown, Christian; Keene, Alex Ruck; Hooper, Carwyn Rhys; O'Brien, Aileen","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101572","20200508",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Antipsychotic-Induced Immune Dysfunction: A Consideration for COVID-19 Risk","Patients with severe mental illness are more susceptible to infections for a variety of reasons, some associated with the underlying disease and some due to environmental factors including housing insecurity, smoking, poor access to healthcare, and medications used to treat these disorders. This increased susceptibility to respiratory infections may contribute to risk of COVID-19 infection in patients with severe mental illness or those in inpatient settings. Atypical antipsychotic (AA) medications are FDA approved to treat symptoms associated with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and irritability associated with autism. Our team and others have shown that AA may have anti-inflammatory properties that may contribute to their efficacy in the treatment of mental health disorders. Additionally, AA are widely prescribed off-label for diverse indications to non-psychotic patients including older adults, who are also at increased risk for COVID-19 complications and mortality. The aim of this study was to determine if AA medications such as risperidone (RIS) alter the ability to mount an appropriate response to an acute inflammatory or adaptive immune challenge using a preclinical model. Short-term treatment of healthy mice with a dose of RIS that achieves plasma concentrations within the low clinical range resulted in disrupted response to an inflammatory (LPS) challenge compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, RIS also prevented treated animals from mounting an antibody response following vaccination with Pneumovax23®. These data indicate that short- to intermediate-term exposure to clinically relevant levels of RIS dysregulate innate and adaptive immune responses, which may affect susceptibility to respiratory infections, including COVID-19.","May, Meghan; Slitzky, Matthew; Rostama, Bahman; Barlow, Deborah; Houseknecht, Karen L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100097","20200623",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Governing Under Pressure: German Policy Making During the Coronavirus Crisis","The global threat of the coronavirus pandemic has forced policy makers to react quickly with totally new policy-making approaches under conditions of uncertainty. This article focuses on such crisis-driven policy learning, examining how the experiences of China and South Korea as early responder states influenced the subsequent coronavirus crisis management in Germany. The first reaction of the German core executive was the quick concentration of decision-making power at the top of the political hierarchy. Asserting the prerogatives of the executive included the radical simplification of the relationship between politics, law and science. State actors took emergency measures by recourse to a single piece of legislation—the ‘infection protection law’ (Infektionsschutzgesetz)—overriding other elements of the legal order. They also limited the government’s use of scientific expertise to a small number of advisors, thereby cutting short debates about the appropriateness or otherwise of the government’s crisis measures. Finally, German actors failed to understand that some of the earlier Chinese and Korean responses required a precondition—namely public willingness to sacrifice privacy for public health—that is absent in the German case.","Dostal, Jörg Michael","https://www.doi.org/10.1111/1467-923x.12865","20200708",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Using air curtains to reduce short-range infection risk in consulting ward: A numerical investigation","Air curtains is promising in reducing the short-range infection risk in hospitals. To quantitatively evaluate its performance, this paper explores air curtains equipped on normal consulting desk to avoid doctor’s direct exposure to the patient exhaled pollutants. A numerical investigation is conducted to evaluate the effects of supply air velocity and angle on cutting off performance. Simulation results show that the average mass fraction of exhaled pollutants decreases significantly (70%–90%) in the consulting ward, indicating satisfying performance of air curtains. Increasing supply air velocity is demonstrated to be conducive in forming full air curtains, whereas an excessively high supply air velocity may be of adverse effects by entraining exhaled flow. Besides, the supply air angle is also critical due to its coupling with supply air velocity. It is found that larger angle (0°–40°) is better where velocity is less than 3 m/s, otherwise a small angle (20°) is preferable where velocity is larger than 3 m/s. Exhaled flow could be well suppressed at the supply air angle 20° but moves over air curtains at 40°. This study can provide effective and intuitive guidance in applying air curtains in consulting wards.

"The putative etiology and prevention of autism","Since the initial psychological report by Leo Kanner in 1943, relatively little formal biochemical/neurological research on the cause of autism, other than peripheral searches for genomic mutations, had been carried until the end of the 20th century. As a result of studies on twin sets and the conclusion that autism was largely a hereditary defect, numerous investigations have sought various genetic faults in particular. However, such studies were able to reveal a plausible etiology for this malady in only a small percentage of instances. Key bio-molecular characteristics of this syndrome have been uncovered when the potential roles of the glia were studied in depth. Findings related to biochemical deficiencies appearing early in the newborn, such as depressed IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor #1) in neurogenesis/myelination, are becoming emphasized in many laboratories. Progress leading to timely diagnoses and subsequent prevention of central nervous system dysconnectivity now seems plausible. The tendency for an infant to develop autism may currently be determinable and preventable before irreversible psychosocial disturbances become established. These discussions about glial function will be inter-spersed with comments about their apparent relevance to autism. The concluding portion of this presentation will be a detailed review and summation of this diagnosis and prevention proposition.","Steinman, Gary","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.013","20200510",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Addressing actual and potential resourcing pressures arising from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, amongst other things, modifications to Scottish mental health and capacity law and the issuing of new guidance relating to associated practice. Whether these emergency or ordinary measures are invoked during the crisis there are potential implications for the rights of persons with mental illness, learning disability and dementia notably those relating to individual autonomy and dignity.

"Relation of Dietary Factors with Infection and Mortality Rates of COVID-19 Across the World","OBJECTIVE: Poor dietary habits are considered to be the second-leading risk factors for mortality and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in the world. Dietary patterns are different based on cultural, environmental, technological, and economic factors. Nutritional deficiencies of energy, protein, and specific micronutrients have been shown to contribute to depressed immune function and increased susceptibility to infections. We aimed to explore the relation of dietary factors with global infection and mortality rates of COVID-19 in this study. DESIGN: In the current ecological study, the countries that had national dietary data from the Global Dietary Databases of the United Nations and Coronavirus disease statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO) were included. The countries that had Coronavirus disease statistics from the WHO were consecutively checked for the recent data of the dietary factors. SETTING: World. PARTICIPANTS: 158 countries across the world. MEASUREMENTS: infection and mortality rates of COVID-19; dietary factors. RESULTS: The median crude infection and mortality rates by COVID-19 were 87.78 (IQR: 468.03) and 0.0015 (IQR: 0.0059), respectively. The two highest percentage of the crude infection rate were between 0 and 500 (75.9%) and 500–1000 (8.9%) per one million persons. The regression analysis showed that the crude infection rate has been increased by raising consuming fruits (Beta: 0.237; P=0.006) and calcium (Beta: 0.286; P=0.007) and was decreased with rising consuming beans and legumes (Beta: -0.145; P=0.038). The analysis showed that the crude mortality rate was increased by raising consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (Beta: 0.340; P<0.001). Whereas, the crude mortality rate by COVID-19 has been decreased by increasing fruits consuming (Beta: -0.226; P=0.047) and beans and legumes (Beta: -0.176; P=0.046). CONCLUSION: The present study showed the higher intake of fruits and sugar-sweetened beverages had a positive effect on infection and mortally rates by COVID-19, respectively. In contrast, the higher intake of beans and legumes had a negative effect on both increasing infection and mortality rates.","Abdulah, Deldar Morad; Hassan, A.

"Death anxiety in the time of COVID-19: theoretical explanations and clinical implications","The recent COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a surge in anxiety across the globe. Much of the public’s behavioural and emotional response to the virus can be understood through the framework of terror management theory, which proposes that fear of death drives much of human behaviour. In the context of the current pandemic, death anxiety, a recently proposed transdiagnostic construct, appears especially relevant. Fear of death has recently been shown to predict not only anxiety related to COVID-19, but also to play a causal role in various mental health conditions. Given this, it is argued that treatment programmes in mental health may need to broaden their focus to directly target the dread of death. Notably, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been shown to produce significant reductions in death anxiety. As such, it is possible that complementing current treatments with specific CBT techniques addressing fears of death may ensure enhanced long-term symptom reduction. Further research is essential in order to examine whether treating death anxiety will indeed improve long-term outcomes, and prevent the emergence of future disorders in vulnerable populations. KEY LEARNING AIMS: (1).. To understand terror management theory and its theoretical explanation of death anxiety in the context of COVID-19. (2).. To understand the transdiagnostic role of death anxiety in mental health disorders. (3).. To understand current treatment approaches for directly targeting death anxiety, and the importance of doing so to improve long-term treatment outcomes.","Menzies, Rachel E.; Menzies, Ross G.","https://www.doi.org/10.1017/s1754470x20000215","20200611",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Mental distress in orthodontic patients during the COVID-19 epidemic","Introduction The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts the mental health of patients, health workers and the public. The level of impact on the mental health of orthodontic patients in treatment is unknown. The objective of the study was to evaluate the mental health of orthodontic patients in China during the early stage of the pandemic. Methods An online questionnaire type of survey was conducted on a convenien ce sample of anonymous participants. The questionnaire, in Chinese (Mandarin), comprised 5 sections. Sections 1 to 3 included demographic, epidemical, and orthodontic status of the patients. Section 4 assessed the mental health related to orthodontics. Section 5 was the Kessler-10 mental distress scale. A total of 48 orthodontists were invited to distribute the questionnaires to their patients. Descriptive statistics, principle component analysis, k-means cluster analysis and bivariate logistics regression analysis were performed with statistical significance set at P<0.05. Result s: Questionnaires were collected from 558 patients (104 males, 354 females; age 24.78 ± 6.33 years [mean ± standard deviation]). The prevalence of mental distress was 38% (174/458). Higher odds ratios were associated with female participants, missed appointments and Hubei residence. Types of orthodontic appliance were associated with anxiety of prolonged treatment duration. The manner of communication with patients regarding the postponement of appointments was associated with patients' concern of prolonged treatment duration. Frequency of contact from dentists was associated with patients' independence. Conclusion s: Over one third of orthodontic patients experienced mental distress during the pandemic. Multiple factors affected the level of anxiety of orthodontic patients, such as the type of orthodontic appliance, interval from the last dental visit, manner of communication with the orthodontist, and the localities of the pandemic progression.","Xiong, Xin; Wu, Yange; Fang, Xinyi; Sun, Wei; Ding, Qin; Yi, Yating; Huang, Yanmei; Gong, Jinglei; Liu, Jin; Wang, Jun","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.07.005","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Videokonsultationen durch Psychotherapeuten in Zeiten der COVID-19-Pandemie: Wirksamkeit, Gestaltung des Settings und erste Erfahrungen aus einer Machbarkeitsstudie sowie mit dem Routineangebot im Krankenhaus","Due to the pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the resulting constraints on personal (i.e. face to face) treatment, video consultations have recently gained a major role in the delivery of healthcare services; however, until now, most psychotherapists have little experience with conducting video consultations, not least because of poor possibilities for reimbursement from the statutory health insurance. This article provides (1) an overview of the effectiveness of psychotherapy interventions delivered via video consultations for depression and anxiety disorders, (2) recommendations for setting up and conducting these consultations and (3) first experiences of psychotherapists from a German feasibility study and from the provision in routine care in hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Haun, Markus W.; Hoffmann, Mariell; Tönnies, Justus; Dinger, Ulrike; Hartmann, Mechthild; Friederich, Hans-Christoph","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s00278-020-00438-6","20200526",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Factors related to mental health of inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the mental health status of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and to explore the related factors. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional survey among COVID-19 inpatients in two isolation wards of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, from March 7, 2020, to March 24, 2020. Participants’ demographic data, clinical data and levels of circulating inflammatory markers were collated. Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients’ self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients’ mental health. RESULTS: Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9=5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7=5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI=8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (AL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients’ self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß=0.313, P<0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß=0.411, P<0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß=0.358, P=0.002) had direct effects on patients’ mental health. The disease duration (ß=0.163, P=0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß=0.101, P=0.016) also indirectly affected patients’ mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. CONCLUSION: A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients’ mental symptoms.","Hu, Yanyu; Chen, Yingying; Zheng, Yixiong; You, Ciping; Tan, Jing; Hu, Lan; Zhang, Zhenqing; Ding, Lijun","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"An Investigation of the Effect of COVID-19 on OCD in Youth in the Context of Emotional Reactivity, Experiential Avoidance, Depression and Anxiety","In addition to the serious physical and medical effects on individuals, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have short- and long-term psycho-social consequences, especially for young people. Nowadays, with psychological problems becoming more widely recognized in adolescents, it is possible that the fear and anxiety caused by the pandemic will trigger various anxiety disorders, OCD and similar negative outcomes. Considering that psychological qualities such as emotional reactivity and experiential avoidance observed in adolescents may increase the risk of such psycho-social disorders, in this study the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and OCD was investigated in a Turkish sample of 598 adolescents, and the mediating role of emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety in this relationship was examined. The data collection was performed online rather than in person because of the COVID-19 threat. A structural equation model was used to determine the direct and indirect predictive effects between variables in data analysis. The results of the study show that the effect of COVID-19 fear on OCD is mediated by emotional reactivity, experiential avoidance and depression-anxiety.

"An Analysis on the Panic During COVID-19 Pandemic Through An Online Form","Abstract With the rapid spread of global pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), people around the world express panic in various behaviors. This affects the economy of the county, social values, and psychological stress of the people involved regardless of the directness of contact with the infected. This study aims to analyze the panic responses of the people as well as the perception on the global issue through an online survey. The researchers used Health Anxiety Inventory and open ended questions regarding the feelings, thoughts and actions of people during the enhanced community quarantine. Quantitative and qualitative data were both analyzed and interpreted interactively. Results also show that there is a significant difference (p=0.028) in the Avoidance behavior between locations. Furthermore, a significant difference (p=0.000) also shows on the Symptoms of Hypochondriasis between exposure to COVID-19. COVID-19 Panic Framework were also conceptualized with the following themes arranged from negative to positive behaviors: Indifference, Annihilation, Nihilism, Paranoia, Sadness, Fear, Transmission of Virus, Shock, Government Blaming, Anxiety, Relating to Past Pandemics, Worry on Self/Family/Others, Information Dissemination, Composure, Compliance, Protection, Cautiousness, Optimism, and Health Consciousness. In conclusion, levels of health anxiety were consistent regardless of location and exposure to COVID-19 patients. Lastly, spectrum of panic consequences due to COVID-19 pandemic were constructed.","Nicomedes, Christian Jasper C.; Avila, Ronn Mikhael A.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.046","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Optimism-pessimism, conspiracy theories and general trust as factors contributing to COVID-19 related behavior – A cross-cultural study","The main aim of this research was to examine the role of optimism-pessimism, general trust and belief in conspiracy theories, in COVID-19 related fears, preventive and hoarding behaviors. We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear. Fear was related to all information sources suggesting that more information leads to higher intensity of fear – except information from the president which did not show any effect.","Jovancevic, Ana; Milicevic, Nebojša","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110216","20200625",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Online Gambling in the Midst of COVID-19: A Nexus of Mental Health Concerns, Substance Use and Financial Stress","This study examined the emerging impact of COVID-19 on gambling during the first 6 weeks of emergency measures in Ontario, Canada. A cross-sectional online survey of 2005 gamblers, including a sub-sample of 1081 online gamblers (age 18 years and older), was administered to assess risky gambling behaviours and motivations, financial impacts from COVID-19, the influence of COVID-19 on online gambling, mental health concerns and substance use. A series of odds ratio comparisons and measures of association were carried out. Results show significant likelihood of online gambling among those classified as high-risk gamblers (according to the Problem Gambling Severity Index) and those with past experience of online gambling, though migration from land-based gambling was apparent. Among high-risk online gamblers, the most predictive risk factors included moderate and severe anxiety and depression, reduced work hours, being influenced to gamble due to COVID-19, gambling under the influence of cannabis or alcohol and risky gambling motives tied to mental health concerns, including gambling because it helps with nervousness and depression, chasing gambling losses and seeking to earn income. This study has confirmed many of the risk associations presented in emerging COVID-19-related studies and past research on global economic crisis relating to gambling risk, mental health concerns and substance use. However, unlike many past studies, the present paper takes note of all of these elements holistically and provides incremental clarity on online gambling risk factors during the pandemic, specifically.","Price, Alex","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00366-1","20200713",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological Stress among Health Care Professionals during the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Disease Outbreak: Cases from Online Consulting Customers","BACKGROUND: During the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, online consulting has been widely used to address mental health problems, including health care professionals (HCPs) caring for COVID-19 patients who experienced substantial psychological distress. AIM: To explore the severity of perceived stress and potential correlates among the HCPs seeking online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: A descriptive study was conducted among 34 HCPs to assess levels of psychological distress using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire. The HCPs working in different departments were compared using <U+03C7>(2)-test for categorized variables and t-test for continuous ones, followed by the analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) to compare the perceived stress. Linear regression for the PSS-10 score was performed to identify potential correlates of stress. RESULTS: The sample overall (n=34) showed a relatively moderate level of perceived stress (PSS mean=15.71±4.02) with 38% identified as depressed (PHQ-9=5) and 24% as suffering from anxiety (GAD-7=5). Those working at intensive care units (ICUs) or in departments of respiratory medicine (RM) demonstrated significantly higher perceived stress than those at other departments (adjusted mean: 17.48±.96 vs. 13.06±1.25, p=.018, partial <U+03B7>(2)=.173). High perceived stress was most strongly associated with being depressed (beta=.486, p=.002) and working at ICUs/RM (beta=.345, p=.023). CONCLUSIONS: The psychological health status of frontline health care professionals during the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak warrants clinical attention. Online mental health services has played a major role although its effectiveness and barriers to its utilization require further evaluation.","Ma, Yarong; Rosenheck, Robert; He, Hongbo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.iccn.2020.102905","20200628",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Adaptation of the Bangla Version of the COVID-19 Anxiety Scale","The Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) is among the first few published screening tools for assessing dysfunctional anxiety induced by the current COVID-19 pandemic. The CAS was translated into the Bangla language following the International Test Commission’s guidelines for this adaptation study and placed in an online survey (N = 737, with a mean age of 26.55 (SD = 7.166 years) to assess the psychometric properties of the Bangla version of the scale. Results suggested that all items had a good item discrimination index and single-factor structure with good factor loadings. The CAS Bangla version was found to have good internal consistency reliabilities, test-retest reliability, and composite reliability (= 0.7). The measurement invariance suggested invariances across age groups and gender. The CAS Bangla version showed a high correlation to the anxiety subscale of the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and a moderate correlation to the depression subscale of the DASS-21 and the COVID-19 Worry Scale. This validation of a Bangla CAS scale would be helpful for mental health practitioners to assess pandemic anxiety among the Bangladeshi people.","Ahmed, Oli; Faisal, Rajib Ahmed; Sharker, Tanima; Lee, Sherman A.; Jobe, Mary C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00357-2","20200627",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Strategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinformatics techniques","The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.","Basu, Anamika; Sarkar, Anasua; Maulik, Ujjwal","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422","20200302",NA,"BioRxiv; MedRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Public behavior change, perceptions, depression, and anxiety in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 has spread rapidly and world-widely, which elicits public panic and psychological problems. Public protective behaviors and perception play crucial roles in controlling the spread of illness and psychological status. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey in the hardest-hit Hubei province and other areas in China affected by COVID-19 outbreak. Questions about their basic information, the perception of the COVID-19 outbreak, recent preventive or avoidance behaviors, and self-reported mental health scales including the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were included. Binary logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between personal variables/perceptions and psychological distress. RESULTS: 6,261 people were included for analysis, with 3,613 (57.7%) in Hubei province (1,743 in Wuhan). A majority of people have adopted preventive and avoidance behaviors. People from Hubei, with contact history, and people who or whose family members were infected had much higher depression or anxiety prevalence. Providing truthful and sufficient information, informing the public about the severity of the disease, and perceptions that the outbreak will be control by protective behaviors were associated with lower depression and anxiety prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the public response, perception, and psychological burden during the outbreak may help improve public health recommendations and deliver timely psychological intervention. Further researches can focus on the psychological status of a specialized group to identify ways for better support based on public response and psychological demand.","Huang, Jing; Liu, Fangkun; Teng, Ziwei; Chen, Jindong; Zhao, Jingping; Wang, Xiaoping; Wu, Ying; Xiao, Jingmei; Wang, Ying; Wu, Renrong","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofaa273","20200703",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Experiences and needs of caregivers of persons with dementia in India during the COVID-19 pandemic – A Qualitative Study","OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences and needs of caregivers of persons with dementia during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in a city in India. DESIGN: Qualitative study using a telephonic semi-structured interview SETTING: A specialist geriatric outpatient mental health service based in a non-governmental organization in Chennai, India. PARTICIPANTS: A purposive sampling of family members of persons with dementia registered in the database and seen within the previous 6 months. RESULTS: Thirty-one caregivers participated. Thematic analysis of the data showed two sets of issues that the caregivers of persons with dementia faced in their experiences during the pandemic. The first set was unique to the caregivers that directly related to their caregiving role, while the second set did not relate directly to their caregiving role. These two sets also appeared to have a two-way interaction influencing each other. These issues generated needs, some of which required immediate support while others required longer-term support. The caregivers suggested several methods, such as use of video-consultations, telephone-based support and clinic-based in-person visits to meet their needs. They also wanted more services post-pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Caregivers of persons with dementia had multiple needs during the pandemic. Supporting them during these times require a pragmatic multi-layered approach. Systemic changes, policies and frameworks, increased awareness, use of technology, and better access to health are necessary.","Vaitheswaran, Dr. Sridhar; Lakshminarayanan, Miss Monisha; Ramanujam, Dr. Vaishnavi; Sargunan, Dr. Subashini; Venkatesan, Miss Shreenila","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.026","20200707",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

The need for ready access to scientifically sound treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is urgent, but gold-standard agonist therapy is often inaccessible. • Drug courts should help to reduce barriers to OUD therapy by offering court-supervised treatment as an alternative to criminal prosecution for certain categories of drug offenses. • Many drug courts, however, reject including the opioid agonist methadone and partial agonist buprenorphine as treatment options, often because these medicines are seen as “another form of addiction”. • Many US drug courts have steered participants to extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, sometimes offering only XR-NTX and no agonist therapies. XR-NTX is very expensive in the US market and also requires a period of abstinence before it can be initiated. • Drug courts overall have had limited success in improving access to OUD treatment and other health and social services needed to achieve significant reduction in overdose death.","Csete, Joanne","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100024","20200609",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Accelerated intermittent theta burst stimulation in late-life depression: A possible option for older depressed adults in need of ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVES: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an essential psychiatric service that has an important role in treating older adult patients with severe or treatment-resistant depression (TRD). During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services may be limited due to infection control measures. We report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a severe major depressive episode who had previously responded to right unilateral ECT and was treated with two modified accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols. METHODS: The two aiTBS treatment courses consisted of 8 daily sessions over five consecutive days, followed by gradual tapering, using 1800 pulses per session pre-COVID-19 (first course), and 600 pulses per session during the pandemic (second course). RESULTS: Moderate to severe baseline depressive symptoms reached remission levels after both courses. CONCLUSIONS: The 600-pulses aiTBS treatment protocol reported here warrants further study and evaluation but may be a potential option in cases where older adults with severe depressive symptoms cannot access ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Konstantinou, Gerasimos N.; Downar, Jonathan; Daskalakis, Zafiris J.; Blumberger, Daniel M.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007","20200715",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Gender and Fear of COVID-19 in a Cuban Population Sample","The COVID-19 pandemic is a global health emergency that could potentially have a serious impact on public health. Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male. Our results corroborate international research that indicate a greater psychological vulnerability in women during the COVID-19 pandemic. This result points to the need to design interventions that reduce the negative impact of the current outbreak on women’s mental health.","Broche-Pérez, Yunier; Fernández-Fleites, Zoylen; Jiménez-Puig, Elizabeth; Fernández-Castillo, Evelyn; Rodríguez-Martin, Boris C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00343-8","20200612",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

RESULTS: Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. CONCLUSIONS: This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.","Slavova, Svetla; Rock, Peter; Bush, Heather M.; Quesinberry, Dana; Walsh, Sharon L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A reformulated contextual model of psychotherapy for treating anxiety and depression","This paper describes a reformulated contextual model that uses cognitive theory (dual process theory), motivation theory (personality) and behavioral adaptation (self-correcting control systems) to show how anxiety and depression are caused, treated and prevented by an interaction between people and contexts. Depression and anxiety are the result of implicit beliefs (not cognitions) that all experience is unrewarding and threatening, these being components of the implicit belief that life is bad. Implicit beliefs are formed automatically from contextual cues and in healthy individuals are consistent with rational appraisal. They become more negative than reality through a process of adaptation when behaviors, directed by rational thinking, repeatedly create cues that signify lack of reward or threat. Such behaviors occur when social or other obligations lead people to choose behaviors that fail to satisfy their own unique goals in life and approach threatening situations, contrary to their automatic reactions. Therapeutic interventions and lifestyle change reverse these adaptive processes by positive experiences that create positive implicit beliefs, a change effected in different ways by contextual and specific mechanisms both of which correct the same fault of negative implicit beliefs. Effective therapeutic relationships and interventions are achieved by detecting and responding to a patient's unique needs and goals and their associated implicit beliefs. Mental health requires not only that people experience life as good as defined by their own goals and beliefs but also the avoidance of contexts where social and other pressures induce people to behave in ways inconsistent with their automatically generated feelings.","Hyland, Michael E.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2020.101890","20200711",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and Union Prevention","One month ago, few people could have foreseen the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of this writing for the current issue of Management Report, the United States has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world, the death toll is climbing, and experts say the situation will get worse before it gets better. Commerce in large areas of the country, including California and the Northeast, has largely shut down. The U.S. secretary of the treasury recently suggested that the U.S. unemployment rate could reach as high as 20 percent. Some economists have said it could go as high as during the economic devastation of the Great Depression, when the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 25 percent in 1933. Other economists have said it may reach 30 percent. It has been predicted that 37 million jobs may be the subject of temporary layoffs during this crisis, and 10 million may be lost permanently.","Wich, Scott","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mare.30595","20200409",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups","OBJECTIVE: To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early recovery stage across their ages in Shenzhen. METHOD: A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS) and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Demographic variables, sociopsychological variables, medical history, and overall parameters of COVID-19 were collected by telephone interviews and by checking medical records. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the statistical analysis using the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS and SAS were 45.5±18.9, 47.3±13.1 and 43.2±10.2 respectively, meanwhile, 9(31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48(38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and post-infection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. CONCLUSION: The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, which may improve after the quarantine or may persist and even deteriorate with time as reported in SARS survivors, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. The current study also contributes to geriatric psychiatry by indicating that the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.","Cai, Xin; Hu, Xiaopeng; Otte, Ekumi Ivo; Wang, Jianchun; An, Yawen; Li, Zhiwen; Yuan, Bo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003","20200710",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff two months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in China: A cross-sectional study","OBJECTIVE: Assessing the psychological status and fatigue of frontline staff exposed to COVID-19 in China. MEASURES: A cross-sectional survey via online questionnaires was conducted to evaluate frontline staff's psychological status and fatigue. Occurrence of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and The Fatigue Self-Assessment Scale (FSAS), respectively. RESULTS: The study included 2614 participants and found that anxiety (23.4%), depression (50.0%), and fatigue (73.7%) were common in frontline workers. Participants were divided into five groups (community workers, health care workers, volunteers, market administration, and others). Analysis showed that levels of depression, anxiety, and fatigue were much higher in community workers than others (P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression indicated that being a woman, young age, sleeping difficulty, having lower income or family support, and physical or mental diseases, were associated with bad mood and proneness to fatigue. Spearman analysis showed fatigue to be highly correlated with depression and anxiety. CONCLUSION: In this study of frontline staff fighting COVID-19 in China, a high incidence of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and fatigue was reported. Effective strategies need to be provided immediately to improve the mental health of staff in the COVID-19 frontline, with community workers, women, the young, and those with physical and mental diseases requiring particular attention.","Teng, Ziwei; Wei, Zirou; Qiu, Yan; Tan, Yuxi; Chen, Jindong; Tang, Hui; Wu, Haishan; Wu, Renrong; Huang, Jing","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.032","20200702",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter","OBJECTIVE: We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. METHODS: During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has affected the lives and minds of faculty and housestaff in our neurology department at the epicenter of the pandemic. Efforts to support these providers during this evolving crisis are imperative for promoting the resilience necessary to care for our patients and colleagues.","Croll, Leah; Kurzweil, Arielle; Hasanaj, Lisena; Serrano, Liliana; Balcer, Laura J.; Galetta, Steven L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jns.2020.117034","20200714",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Theoretical and applied study of the psychological and educational effects of lockdown in primary school students in Argentina","Abstract Emotions are complex states, which have a fundamental role for children’s mental health and learning. The proper self-regulation of emotions allows to tolerate frustrations, improves social skills and healthy bonds with peers and adults in the environment (Bisquerra, 2003, p. 12). The lack of regulation causes discomfort that leads to a decrease in academic performance (Graziano, Reavis, Keanes & Calkins, 2006) and particularly in reading comprehension, because this competence requires motivation and cognitive processes that will allow to process the linguistic code, interpret it and represent it symbolically (Alonso-Tapia, 2005, p. 64). In this work, we show the essential relationship between emotional regulation and reading comprehension in primary school students. After that, we study the effect of lockdown on these two processes. The aim is to have preliminary information about the challenges and effects of the current situation. To do this, a semi-structured survey has been conducted of parents and teachers in order to assess the psychological and educational effects of the current health situation. The results of 40 semi-structured telephone surveys are analyzed, 20 of parents of children with learning disorders and 20 of their classroom teachers in Traslasierra, Córdoba-Argentina. The results inform that the students and their parents have difficulties to regulate their emotions and this emotional struggle has a negative impact on comprehension of texts. The problems that previously presented in these two areas have increased due to the lack of adaptation of activities by teachers, the lack of knowledge of their parents to help them and the difficulty in accessing digital technologies. Both parents and teachers express that lockdown affects learning processes, although parents are also concerned about the effects on social life.","Sevilla Vallejo, Santiago; Ceballos Marón, Natalia Andrea","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100039","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological Intervention and COVID-19: What We Know So Far and What We Can Do","The coronavirus COVID-19 and the global pandemic has already had a substantial disruptive impact on society, posing major challenges to the provision of mental health services in a time of crisis, and carrying the spectre of an increased burden to mental health, both in terms of existing psychiatric disorder, and emerging psychological distress from the pandemic. In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.","Inchausti, Felix; MacBeth, Angus; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit; Dimaggio, Giancarlo","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10879-020-09460-w","20200527",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

Executive Order 20-28 authorizes out-of-state mental health providers to treat Minnesota patients via telehealth services to “help ensure that the mental health needs of Minnesotans are met during the stress and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The order notes that many Minnesotans receive mental health care from providers in neighboring states, and this order will allow them to continue that care via virtual means. Gov. Walz has been trying to expand Minnesota's mental health care options during COVID-19, asking President Trump for a major disaster declaration so the state can be reimbursed for expanding community-based crisis counseling services. Executive Order 20-29 amends a previous order, EO 20-05, that was designed to help Minnesotans get unemployment insurance as quickly as possible rather than waiting the previous week following the loss of their jobs. Gov. Walz also announced $6.2 million in financial assistance grants that is earmarked for Minnesota veterans and their families who have been impacted by COVID-19 and will provide one-time payments of $1,000.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32320","20200410",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Psychometric Properties of a Spanish Version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale in General Population of Lima, Peru","The current pandemic of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 has increased the anxiety and fear experienced by many. The main objective of this study was to analyze the psychometric properties of the Spanish-translated version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) using a sample of population in Peru. This is a cross-sectional instrumental study. Data were collected by a convenience sampling method, resulting in a total of 832 participants, and the collection took place over 1 week, April 17–23, 2020. The original version of the FCV-19S was translated from English into Spanish. The results support a bifactor model consisting of one general factor and two specific factors—one of emotional fear reactions and another of somatic expressions of fear of COVID-19 (CFI = 0.988, RMSEA = 0.075). Invariance between healthcare workers and age groups was reached (<U+0394>CFI < 0.01), but the invariance between men and women was not met (<U+0394>CFI = 0.02). Convergent validity was found with depressive, anxious, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. The general factor of the fear of COVID-19 and two specific factors had an optimal level of internal consistency (<U+03C9> > 0.89 and a > 0.83). The study found the Spanish-translated version of the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties and presents evidence of validity and reliability.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. METHODS: During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). CONCLUSION: Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health. Our findings can be used to construct psychological interventions directed toward vulnerable populations and to implement public mental health strategies in the early stages of the outbreak.","Alkhamees, Abdulmajeed A.; Alrashed, Saleh A.; Alzunaydi, Ali A.; Almohimeed, Ahmed S.; Aljohani, Moath S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152192","20200712",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A contextual behavioral approach for responding to moral dilemmas in the age of COVID-19()()","Prior pandemics and current news stories suggest that a “second pandemic” of potentially devastating mental health consequences will follow the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the changing contextual demands associated with the pandemic for many people, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 are likely to include exposure to a range of moral dilemmas. Such dilemmas may set the stage for the development of moral distress and moral injury in a broad range of contexts from the ER to the grocery store. In the current paper we offer an approach to responding to moral dilemmas presented by COVID-19. We propose a contextual behavioral model of moral injury that is relevant to those experiencing moral pain associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on this model, we offer two different approaches to intervening on COVID-19-related moral dilemmas. First, we propose the use of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy for Moral Injury (ACT-MI) among individuals suffering from moral injury. Second, to intervene on moral dilemmas at the level of the group, we propose the use of the Prosocial intervention. We offer case examples describing ACT-MI and Prosocial to highlight how these interventions might be applied to moral-dilemma-related concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss implications for future research.","Borges, Lauren M.; Barnes, Sean M.; Farnsworth, Jacob K.; Drescher, Kent D.; Walser, Robyn D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.06.006","20200704",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"A new SAIR model on complex networks for analysing the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","Nowadays, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading around the world and has attracted extremely wide public attention. From the beginning of the outbreak to now, there have been many mathematical models proposed to describe the spread of the pandemic, and most of them are established with the assumption that people contact with each other in a homogeneous pattern. However, owing to the difference of individuals in reality, social contact is usually heterogeneous, and the models on homogeneous networks cannot accurately describe the outbreak. Thus, we propose a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-removed (SAIR) model on social networks to describe the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. Then, according to the results of the simulations, we discover that the measures that can curb the spread of COVID-19 include increasing the recovery rate and the removed rate, cutting off connections between symptomatically infected individuals and their neighbours, and cutting off connections between hub nodes and their neighbours. The feasible measures proposed in the paper are in fair agreement with the measures that the government took to suppress the outbreak. Furthermore, effective measures should be carried out immediately, otherwise the pandemic would spread more rapidly and last longer. In addition, we use the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2 to analyse the outbreak in the city and explain why the number of the infected rose in the early stage of the outbreak though a total lockdown was implemented. Moreover, besides the above measures, a feasible way to curb the spread of COVID-19 is to reduce the density of social networks, such as restricting mobility and decreasing in-person social contacts. This work provides a series of effective measures, which can facilitate the selection of appropriate approaches for controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate its adverse impact on people’s livelihood, societies and economies.","Liu, Congying; Wu, Xiaoqun; Niu, Riuwu; Wu, Xiuqi; Fan, Ruguo","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11071-020-05704-5","20200615",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Evaluation of depression and anxiety levels and related factors among operating theatre workers during the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Abstract Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on healthcare workers due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of healthcare professionals working in operating theatres in various healthcare institutions in Turkey. Methods The data were collected online between 9 April 2020 and 12 April 2020 using a SurveyMonkey questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, California, United States) and healthcare workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings In total, 702 healthcare professionals working in operating theatres participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4±4.6 (min: 0–max: 21) and 10.0±4.5 (min: 0–max: 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (p<0.05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease and those whose workload increased (p<0.05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among healthcare professionals working in operating theatres. In order to reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of healthcare professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.","Koksal, Ersin; Dost, Burhan; Terzi, Özlem; Ustun, Yasemin Burcu; Özdin, Selçuk; Bilgin, Sezgin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017","20200619",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","Abstract Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients. Healthcare organizations need to provide professional therapeutic advice and psychosocial support for this population of patients during the pandemic.","Stojanov, Aleksandar; Malobabic, Marina; Milosevic, Vuk; Stojanov, Jelena; Vojinovic, Slobodan; Stanojevic, Goran; Stevic, Milos","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102407","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","Nadkarni, Abhijit; Kapoor, Arjun; Pathare, Soumitra","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200520",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Do Quarantine Experiences and Attitudes Towards COVID-19 Affect the Distribution of Mental Health in China? A Quantile Regression Analysis","While quarantine has become a widely used control strategy during the outbreak of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), empirical research on whether and to what extent quarantine and attitudes towards COVID-19 affect mental health is scant. Using a cross-sectional online survey, this paper is the first from the Chinese outbreak to investigate how quarantine experiences and attitudes towards COVID-19 are related to mental health, and how these relationships change across the distribution of mental health scores. Using quantile regression analysis, we found that home self-quarantine is associated with a decrease in depression and an increase in happiness, while community-level quarantine is associated with decreased happiness, especially for those in the lower happiness quantile. We also found that favorable attitudes towards COVID-19 regarding the credibility of real-time updates and confidence in the epidemic control are associated with lower levels of depression and higher levels of happiness. These effects are stronger in the upper quantile of depression and the median quantile of happiness.","Lu, Haiyang; Nie, Peng; Qian, Long","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11482-020-09851-0","20200629",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Community-based programs to tackle environmental education and COVID-19: A case study from Millburn, New Jersey","Contextual and social realities must be built into any educational program for activism to take place. This case study examines an education and environment program which has adapted to the social distancing measures of COVID-19, resulting in an even more community-reliant and community-driven program than the program designers initially intended. The Eco Ambassador Program uses environmental activism within a space that supports mental health during COVID-19 social isolation. While community engagement and action have been elements of the program, the program has transformed to utilize new levels of social capital in the program’s network, to overcome the obstacles presented in regular programming. Many aspects of the critical pedagogy of space are utilized to conceptualize this educational program during the pandemic. The limitations of in-person interactions in defined learning spaces led to more technology-reliant programming, hence broadening the space of place-based learning, while enabling personal spaces and personal environments to become new learning spaces.","Iyengar, Radhika; Shin, Haein","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09467-0","20200529",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: a case-control study","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. METHODS: This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. RESULTS: Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57-2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46-2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99-1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63-2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92-1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53-1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54-3.52) for mental problems. LIMITATIONS: The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. CONCLUSIONS: Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.","Cai, Qi; Feng, Hongliang; Huang, Jing; Wang, Meiyao; Wang, Qunfeng; Lu, Xuanzhen; Xie, Yu; Wang, Xing; Liu, Zhenxing; Hou, Botong; Ouyang, Keni; Pan, Jing; Li, Qin; Fu, Beibei; Deng, Yongchao; Liu, Yumin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031","20200702",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychiatric Aspects of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine Treatment in the Wake of COVID-19: Psychopharmacological Interactions and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae","BACKGROUND: Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are among several experimental treatments being investigated in the urgent response to the COVID-19. With increased use of these medications, physicians need to become knowledgeable of these drugs’ neuropsychiatric side effects and interactions with psychiatric medications. METHODS: Literature review was performed in PubMed from 1950-2020 regarding psychiatric topics and targeted pharmacological properties of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. REVIEW: First, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine may mildly inhibit CYP2D6 metabolism of psychiatric medications, and psychiatric medications that interfere with CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 activity could alter chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine levels. Second, they may prolong the QT interval, warranting caution with concomitant prescription of other QT prolonging agents. Finally, neuropsychiatric side effects are very uncommon but possible, and include a potentially prolonged phenomenon of “psychosis following chloroquine.” Hydroxychloroquine has less information available about its neuropsychiatric side effects than chloroquine, with psychosis literature limited to several case reports. It is not clear whether patients with psychiatric illness are more vulnerable to neuropsychiatric sequela of these medications, however, overdose on these medications by suicidal patients has high risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: The risk of neuropsychiatric side effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine when used for COVID-19 treatment is not known. Best practice may include suicide risk assessment for patients treated with hydroxychloroquine. However, delirium is expected to be a more likely etiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in critically ill patients treated for COVID-19, and adjustment disorder is a much more likely etiology of anxiety and depression symptoms than the side effects of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine.","Hamm, Brandon S.; Rosenthal, Lisa J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.06.022","20200708",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Massachusetts coalition launches campaign to preserve bed access","A coalition of registered nurses with the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA), along with patients, families, advocates and elected officials who have been fighting for the preservation of mental health beds across Western Massachusetts, has launched a new campaign, “Mental Health is Public Health,” to save essential inpatient psychiatric services, according to a March 16 news release. The effort comes as Trinity Health plans to close 74 pediatric and adult psychiatric beds at Providence Behavioral Health Hospital in Holyoke; Baystate Health seeks the closure of all its mental health beds in Greenfield, Palmer and Westfield; and COVID-19 places additional pressure on already-strained emergency departments and other hospital services throughout the region. “These proposed closures would devastate an already-strained mental health system,” said Cindy Chaplin, RN at Providence and co-chair of the MNA Bargaining Committee. “Right now, we need to maximize capacity in emergency departments and other hospital units, not decrease services. When everyone else in Massachusetts agrees we should be making it easier for patients to get high-quality mental healthcare, Trinity Health is going in the opposite direction.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32287","20200320",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Evaluation of botanical powders and extracts from Nigerian plants as protectants of maize grains against maize weevil, Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky) [oleoptera: Curculionidae]","Toxicities of leaf powders and extracts of Acanthus montanus, Acanthospermum hispidum, Alchornea laxiflora and Argyreia nervosa against maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) were evaluated. Powders were tested at dose 3.0g/20g while extracts were tested at concentration 3%/20g of maize grains. Mortality, oviposition, and adult emergence rates as well as weight loss, seeds damage and weevil perforation index (WPI) were evaluated. Phytochemical constituents of the experimental plants were also carried out. The results showed that Acanthus montanus powder was the most potent with 65% adult mortality after 24 h of treatment. This is followed by Argyreia nervosa powder that evoked 52.5% weevil mortality. The least toxic to S. zeamais was Acanthospermum hispidum powder with 32.5% adult mortality. Extracts were more toxic than the powders of the tested plants. Acanthus montanus extract was the most toxic since it promoted 80% adult mortality after 24 h of treatment. Acanthus montanus, Alchornea laxiflora and Argyreia nervosa leaf powders and extracts completely prevented oviposition by adult insect, adult emergence, weight loss and seeds damaged. The phytochemicals present in Acanthus montanus were alkaloids (3.67 mg/g), saponin (3.33 mg/g), tannin (3.00 mg/g) and flavonoid (2.67 mg/g) contents. Acanthospermum hispidum had the least alkaloid (2.67 mg/g), saponin (1.67 mg/g), tannin (1.33 mg/g) and flavonoid (1.00 mg/g) contents. Acanthus montanus, Argyreia nervosa, Alchornea laxiflora and Acanthospermum hispidum were efficacious against S. zeamais instead of synthetic chemical insecticides that have environmental health hazards and they can be used in integrated pest management by farmers and foods merchants.","Ileke, Kayode David; Idoko, Joy Ejemin; Ojo, Durojaye Olanrewaju; Adesina, Bukola Christianah","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcab.2020.101702","20200709",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of the COVID-19 is a severe global crisis and resulted in public health problems in many aspects. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged =17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5(th) to 14(th) March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. RESULTS: Totally, near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%-16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years old, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study can be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during such public health emergency.","Yang, Yu; Zhu, Jian-fu; Yang, Shu-yue; Lin, Hai-jiang; Chen, Yue; Zhao, Qi; Fu, Chao-wei","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034","20200714",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Minimizing the aerosol-generating procedures in orthodontics in the era of a pandemic: Current evidence on the reduction of hazardous effects for the treatment team and patients","The purpose of this critical review is to list the sources of aerosol production during orthodontic standard procedure, analyze the constituent components of aerosol and their dependency on modes of grinding, the presence of water and type of bur, and suggest a method to minimize the quantity and detrimental characteristics of the particles comprising the solid matter of aerosol. Minimization of water-spray syringe utilization for rinsing is suggested on bonding related procedures, while temporal conditions as represented by seasonal epidemics should be considered for the decision of intervention scheme provided as a preprocedural mouth rinse, in an attempt to reduce the load of aerosolized pathogens. In normal conditions, chlorhexidine 0.2%, preferably under elevated temperature state should be prioritized for reducing bacterial counts. In the presence of oxidation vulnerable viruses within the community, substitute strategies might be represented by the use of povidone iodine 0.2%-1%, or hydrogen peroxide 1%. After debonding, extensive material grinding, as well as aligner related attachment clean-up, should involve the use of carbide tungsten burs under water cooling conditions for cutting efficiency enhancement, duration restriction of the procedure, as well as reduction of aerosolized nanoparticles. In this respect, selection strategies of malocclusions eligible for aligner treatment should be reconsidered and future perspectives may entail careful and more restricted utilization of attachment grips. For more limited clean-up procedures, such as grinding of minimal amounts of adhesive remnants, or individualized bracket debonding in the course of treatment, hand-instruments for remnant removal might well represent an effective strategy. Efforts to minimize the use of rotary instrumentation in orthodontic settings might also lead the way for future solutions. Measures of self-protection for the treatment team should never be neglected. Dressing gowns and facemasks with filter protection layers, appropriate ventilation and fresh air flow within the operating room comprise significant links to the overall picture of practice management. Risk management considerations should be constant, but also updated as new material applications come into play, while being grounded on the best available evidence.","Eliades, Theodore; Koletsi, Despina","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajodo.2020.06.002","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"How mental health care should change as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic","The unpredictability and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic; the associated lockdowns, physical distancing, and other containment strategies; and the resulting economic breakdown could increase the risk of mental health problems and exacerbate health inequalities. Preliminary findings suggest adverse mental health effects in previously healthy people and especially in people with pre-existing mental health disorders. Despite the heterogeneity of worldwide health systems, efforts have been made to adapt the delivery of mental health care to the demands of COVID-19. Mental health concerns have been addressed via the public mental health response and by adapting mental health services, mostly focusing on infection control, modifying access to diagnosis and treatment, ensuring continuity of care for mental health service users, and paying attention to new cases of mental ill health and populations at high risk of mental health problems. Sustainable adaptations of delivery systems for mental health care should be developed by experts, clinicians, and service users, and should be specifically designed to mitigate disparities in health-care provision. Thorough and continuous assessment of health and service-use outcomes in mental health clinical practice will be crucial for defining which practices should be further developed and which discontinued. For this Position Paper, an international group of clinicians, mental health experts, and users of mental health services has come together to reflect on the challenges for mental health that COVID-19 poses. The interconnectedness of the world made society vulnerable to this infection, but it also provides the infrastructure to address previous system failings by disseminating good practices that can result in sustained, efficient, and equitable delivery of mental health-care delivery. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic could be an opportunity to improve mental health services.","Moreno, Carmen; Wykes, Til; Galderisi, Silvana; Nordentoft, Merete; Crossley, Nicolas; Jones, Nev; Cannon, Mary; Correll, Christoph U; Byrne, Louise; Carr, Sarah; Chen, Eric Y H; Gorwood, Philip; Johnson, Sonia; Kärkkäinen, Hilkka; Krystal, John H; Lee, Jimmy; Lieberman, Jeffrey; López-Jaramillo, Carlos; Männikkö, Miia; Phillips, Michael R; Uchida, Hiroyuki; Vieta, Eduard; Vita, Antonio; Arango, Celso","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/s2215-0366(20)30307-2","20200716",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Deliberate release: Plague – A review","Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered one of the most likely pathogens to be used as a bioweapon. In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001","20200330",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan","Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Results: Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90s (ß = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (ß = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (ß = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression.

"Evidence map on the contributions of traditional, complementary and integrative medicines for health care in times of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Due to the pandemic, there is a significant interest in the therapeutic resources linked to TCIM to support potentially therapeutic research and intervention in the management of COVID-19. At the date of this evidence map´s publication, there is no evidence of specific treatments for Coronavirus - 19 (COVID-19). This map organizes information about symptoms management (especially on dimensions related to mental health and mild viral respiratory infections, as well as immune system strengthening and antiviral activity). METHOD: This evidence map applies methodology developed by Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information based on the 3iE evidence gap map. A search was performed in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine Virtual Health Library and PubMed, using the MeSH and DeCS terms for respiratory viral diseases associated with epidemics, COVID-19 symptoms, relevant mental health topics, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions related to TCIM. RESULTS: For the map, 126 systematic reviews and controlled clinical studies were characterized, distributed in a matrix with 57 interventions (18 phytotherapy, 9 mind-body therapies, 10 traditional chinese medicine, 3 homeopathic and anthroposophic dynamized medicines and 17 supplements), and 67 outcomes (14 immunological response, 23 mental health, 25 complementary clinical management of the infection and 5 other). DISCUSSION: The map presents an overview of possible TCIM contributions to various dimensions of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the field of mental health, and it is directed to researchers and health professionals specialized in TCIM. Most of the antiviral activity outcomes described in this map refers to respiratory viruses in general, and not specifically to SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2). This information may be useful to guide new research, but not necessarily to support a therapeutic recommendation.

"“It's about how much we can do, and not how little we can get away with”: Coronavirus-related legislative changes for social care in the United Kingdom","The coronavirus pandemic, referred to here as Covid-19, has brought into sharp focus the increasing divergence of devolved legislation and its implementation in the United Kingdom. One such instance is the emergency health and social care legislation and guidance introduced by the United Kingdom Central Government and the devolved Governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland in response to this pandemic. We provide a summary, comparison and discussion of these proposed and actual changes with a particular focus on the impact on adult social care and safeguarding of the rights of citizens. To begin, a summary and comparison of the relevant changes, or potential changes, to mental health, mental capacity and adult social care law across the four jurisdictions is provided. Next, we critique the suggested and actual changes and in so doing consider the immediate and longer term implications for adult social care, including mental health and mental capacity, at the time of publication.several core themes emerged: concerns around process and scrutiny; concerns about possible changes to the workforce and last, the possible threat on the ability to safeguard human rights. It has been shown that, ordinarily, legislative provisions across the jurisdictions of the UK are different, save for Wales (which shares most of its mental health law provisions with England). Such divergence is also mirrored in the way in which the suggested emergency changes could be implemented. Aside from this, there is also a wider concern about a lack of parity of esteem between social care and health care, a concern which is common to all. What is interesting is that the introduction of CVA 2020 forced a comparison to be made between the four UK nations which also shines a spotlight on how citizens can anticipate receipt of services.","Vicary, Sarah; Stone, Kevin; McCusker, Pearse; Davidson, Gavin; Spencer-Lane, Tim","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101601","20200622",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

METHODS: An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). RESULTS: About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the present findings, it is essential to introduce time-oriented policy, and implement care monitoring plans in the country, which may help in managing the pandemic as well as nurturing the public mental health to combat COVID-19 related psychological challenges.","Islam, S.M.

"International tracking of the COVID-19 invasion: an amazing example of a globalized scientific coordination effort","It is extraordinary to witness the spread of COVID-19 almost in real-time. This tight monitoring of the invasion of a new virus is a situation that most other invasion scientists could only dream of. Especially spatiotemporal spread data of the early phases of an invasion would be extremely useful in order to understand and predict the human-mediated spread of species around the globe. So far, invasive species that directly affect human health, such as the Sars-Cov-2 virus causing COVID-19, have been treated differently from invasive species affecting environmental health. Despite progresses in constructing large checklists of invasive species, these records often enter the databases only decades after the establishment of the organism in a country. This is inadequate to understand ongoing spread dynamics and estimate current invasion risks. Yet, national services often possess extremely useful information about early detections and interceptions of species at air and maritime ports, which could greatly improve predictions and help set management priorities. Considering the massive impacts of invasive species, it is time to move on to such a collaborative way of handling invasion data. Invasive insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and other species are the result of globalization and call for a globalized response, exactly like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertelsmeier, Cleo; Ollier, Sébastien","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02287-5","20200519",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Stress and burnout in health care workers during COVID-19 pandemic: validation of a questionnaire","AIM: To validate a questionnaire to assess stress and burnout in healthcare workers during COVID-19 pandemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In this study, content validity, Cronbach’s alpha, and test–retest reliability method were utilized among 60 HCWs to evaluate the validity, internal consistency, and reliability of the questionnaire respectively. The final questionnaire was composed of four parts asking for the background information, questions about the stress caused by the COVID-19, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS-21), and six questions from the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). RESULTS: The CVR of 46 questions was equal to 1, making them acceptably valid (CVR > 0.78), so that the items could be arranged into a final questionnaire. Moreover, all items could successfully attain CVI values above 0.79, confirming the content validity of the questionnaire. The Cronbach’s alpha was between 0.80–0.95 for different sections of questionaire, confirming the stable reliability and high repeatability of the questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that the DASS-21 offers adequate levels of validity and reliability for assessing the stress, anxiety, and depression among the HCWs engaged with the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the six items adapted from the Copenhagen burnout inventory (CBI) were found to provide a good instrument for investigating the job burnout among the HCWs at Masih Daneshvari Hospital during the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Talaee, Negin; Varahram, Mohammad; Jamaati, Hamidreza; Salimi, Alireza; Attarchi, Mirsaeed; Kazempour dizaji, Mehdi; Sadr, Makan; Hassani, Somayeh; Farzanegan, Behrooz; Monjazebi, Fateme; Seyedmehdi, Seyed Mohammad","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01313-z","20200606",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"

"Current and Future Challenges in the Delivery of Mental Healthcare during COVID-19","The USA is in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. We assess the impact of COVID-19 on psychiatric symptoms in healthcare workers, those with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population. We highlight the challenges ahead and discuss the increased relevance of telepsychiatry. We analyzed all available literature available as of March 25, 2020, on PubMed, Ovid Medline, and PsychInfo. We utilized the MeSH term “covid AND (psychiatry OR mental health)” and included all articles. Duplicates were removed resulting in 32 articles, of which 19 are cited. Four additional references are included to examine suicide data. During the review process, an additional 7 articles were identified which are also included. Frontline healthcare workers are currently experiencing increased psychiatric symptoms and this is more severe in females and nurses. Non-frontline healthcare workers, as well as the general population, are experiencing vicarious traumatization. People with psychiatric comorbidities, and the general population, face increased psychiatric symptom burden. Migrant workers, the elderly, children, and the homeless may be disproportionately impacted. Suicide rates may be impacted. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a severe disruption to the delivery of mental healthcare. Psychiatric facilities are facing unprecedented disruptions in care provision as they struggle to manage an infected population with comorbid psychiatric symptoms. Telepsychiatry is a flawed but reasonable solution to increase the availability of mental healthcare during COVID-19.","Gautam, Mohan; Thakrar, Anjali; Akinyemi, Esther; Mahr, Greg","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00348-3","20200611",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Psychometric Testing of Three COVID-19-Related Scales Among People with Mental Illness","Fear of novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may result in psychological health problems among different populations. Moreover, believing COVID-19 information and preventive COVID-19 infection behaviors are relevant constructs associated with fear of COVID-19. Therefore, the present study validated three instruments assessing fear, beliefs, and preventive behaviors related to COVID-19 among individuals with mental illness. Moreover, relationships between the three constructs were examined. Individuals with mental illness (N = 400; 178 females; mean age = 46.91 years) completed the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S), Believing COVID-19 Information Scale (BCIS), Preventive COVID-19 Infection Behaviors Scale (PCIBS), and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). The FCV-19S, BCIS, and PCIBS demonstrated a single-factor structure with satisfactory fit indices. Moreover, believing COVID-19 information positively and significantly associated with fear of COVID-19, and fear of COVID-19 negatively and significantly associated with preventive behaviors and positively and significantly associated with psychological distress. The FCV-19S, BCIS, and PCIBS may assist healthcare providers in assessing COVID-19-related information among individuals with mental illness. Consequently, relevant programs may be designed to help individuals with mental illness going through the period of crisis.","Chang, Kun-Chia; Hou, Wen-Li; Pakpour, Amir H.; Lin, Chung-Ying; Griffiths, Mark D.","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00361-6","20200711",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
"Coronavirus Stress, Optimism-Pessimism, Psychological Inflexibility, and Psychological Health: Psychometric Properties of the Coronavirus Stress Measure","The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is currently a global health threat attributed to negatively affecting the mental health and well-being of people globally. The purpose of the present study is to examine the mediating role of optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility in the relationship of coronavirus stress with psychological problems among Turkish adults. The sample of the study included 451 adults (55% women). Participants mainly consisted of young adults with a mean age of 23.30 years, ranging from 18 to 65 years (SD = 6.97). A mediation model indicated that coronavirus stress had a significant predictive effect on optimism-pessimism, psychological inflexibility, and psychological problems. Further, optimism-pessimism and psychological inflexibility mediated the effect of coronavirus stress on psychological problems in adults. Lastly, optimism-pessimism predicted the psychological problems of adults through psychological inflexibility. These results elucidate our understanding of the role of mediators in coronavirus stress and psychological health problems. The findings are useful in terms of providing evidence for tailoring interventions and implementing preventative approaches to mitigate the psychopathological consequences of COVID-19. Based on the present findings, the potential utility of acceptance and commitment therapy is discussed within the context of COVID-19.","Arslan, Gökmen; Yildirim, Murat; Tanhan, Ahmet; Bulus, Metin; Allen, Kelly-Ann","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00337-6","20200604",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-07-26"
