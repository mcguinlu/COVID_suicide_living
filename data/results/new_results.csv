"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of UK healthcare workers","Background There is an urgent need to understand the psychological impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on UK healthcare workers (HCW). Aims To reveal risk and protective factors associated with poor mental wellbeing of HCW working during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Method 2773 UK HCWs completed a survey between 22ndApril and 10th May 2020 containing scales measuring anxiety, depression, PTSD, and stress, and questions about roles and COVID-19-related factors including workplace preparation and risk management. Respondents were classified as high or low symptomatic on each mental health scale and logistic regression revealed risk and protective factors associated with each outcome. Change in wellbeing from pre to during COVID-19 was also quantified. Results A large proportion of UK HCW had high mental health symptoms. Fixed risk factors of poor mental health included being female, being frontline, pre-existing mental health diagnoses, and experience of stressful/traumatic events. An additional set of controllable factors also significantly increased risk: PPE availability, workload, lack of COVID-19 preparation and training, and insufficient communication of clinical procedures. Resilience and sharing stress reduced risk, as did ethical support for those making treatment decisions. Allied HCW and managers were at elevated risk of high symptoms particularly PTSD. Wellbeing, especially of frontline workers, had significantly worsened compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Poor mental wellbeing was prevalent in HCW during the UK COVID-19 response. A number of controllable factors should be targeted, and protective factors promoted, to reduce the detrimental effect of COVID-19 and other pandemics on HCW mental health.","James Gilleen; Aida Santaolalla; Lorena Valdearenas; Clara Salice; Monserrat Fuste","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218396","20201027",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Socio-educational Impact and Psychological Distress of Medical Students amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Japanese Cross-Sectional Survey","The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected medical education. However, few data are available about medical students' distress during the pandemic. This study aimed to provide details on how medical students had been affected by the pandemic. In this cross-sectional study, 717 medical students participated in the web-based survey. The questions included how their mental status had changed before and after the Japanese nationwide state of emergency (SOE). 65.9% (473/717) participated in the study. 29.8% (141/473) reported concerns about the shift toward online education, mostly because they thought online education could have been ineffective compared with in-person learning. Participant's subjective mental health status significantly worsened after the SOE was lifted (p <.001). Those who had concerns about a shift toward online education had higher odds of having generalized anxiety and being depressed (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.19 - 3.28), as did those who requested food aid and mental health care resources (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.16 - 3.44; OR 3.56, 95% CI 2.07 - 6.15, respectively). Given our findings, the sudden shift to online education might have overwhelmed medical students. Thus, we recommend educators to inform learners that online learning is non-inferior to in-person learning, which could attenuate potential depression and anxiety.","Yoshito Nishimura; Kanako Ochi; Kazuki Tokumasu; Mikako Obika; Hideharu Hagiya; Hitomi Kataoka; Fumio Otsuka","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.22.20216572","20201027",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Online information on face masks in Italian and English websites: issues and responsibilities of search engines","Countries have major differences in the acceptance of face mask use for the prevention of COVID-19. We analyzed 450 webpages returned by searching the string 'are face masks dangerous' in Italy, the UK and the USA using three search engines (Bing, Duckduckgo and Google). The majority (64-79%) were pages from news outlets, with few (2-6%) pages from government and public health agencies. Webpages with a positive stance on masks were more frequent in English (50%) than in Italian (36%), and those with a negative stance were more frequent in Italian (28% vs. 19% in English). Google returned the highest number of mask-positive pages and Duckduckgo the lowest. Google also returned the lowest number of pages mentioning conspiracy theories and Duckduckgo the highest. Webpages in Italian scored lower than those in English in transparency (reporting authors, their credentials and backing the information with references). When issues about the use of face masks were analyzed, mask effectiveness was the most discussed followed by hypercapnia (accumulation of carbon dioxide), contraindication in respiratory disease, and hypoxia, with issues related to their contraindications in mental health conditions and disability mentioned by very few pages. This study suggests that: 1) public health agencies should increase their web presence in providing correct information on face masks; 2) search engines should improve the information quality criteria in their ranking; 3) the public should be more informed on issues related to the use of masks and disabilities, mental health and stigma arising for those people who cannot wear masks.","Shaily Meta; Daria Ghezzi; Alessia Catalani; Tania Vanzolini; Pietro Ghezzi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.23.20218271","20201027",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Causes of death in mental health service users during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: South London and Maudsley data from March to June 2020, compared with 2015-2019","The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a particularly high impact on the health and wellbeing of people with pre-existing mental disorders. This may include higher than expected mortality rates due to severe infections themselves, due to other comorbidities, or through increased suicide rates during lockdown. However, there has been very little published information to date on causes of death in mental health service users. Taking advantage of a large mental healthcare database linked to death registrations, we describe numbers of deaths within specific underlying-cause-of-death groups for the period from 1st March to 30th June in 2020 and compare these with the same four-month periods in 2015-2019. In past and current service users, there were 2561 deaths in March-June 2020, compared to an average of 1452 for the same months in 2015-19: an excess of 1109. The 708 deaths with COVID-19 as the underlying cause in 2020 accounted for 63.8% of that excess. The remaining excess was accounted for by unnatural/unexplained deaths and by deaths recorded as due to neurodegenerative conditions, with no excess in those attributed to cancer, circulatory disorders, digestive disorders, respiratory disorders, or other disease codes. Of 295 unexplained deaths in 2020 with missing data on cause, 162 (54.9%) were awaiting a formal death notice (i.e. the group that included deaths awaiting a coroner inquest), an excess of 129 compared to the average of previous years, accounting for 11.6% of the excess in total deaths.","Robert Stewart; Amelia Jewell; Matthew Broadbent; Ioannis Bakolis; Jayati Das-Munshi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.25.20219071","20201027",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Determinants of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures: a nationwide on-line survey in Greece and Cyprus","Abstract A limited number of studies have investigated the distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population. We studied psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures in the general population in Greece and Cyprus. Also, we investigated several demographic, clinical and job characteristics of the participants as possible determinants of distress. Data collection was performed during lockdown measures in Greece and Cyprus (from April 21st to May 4th 2020). All participants provided informed consent to participate in the study. We used the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) to measure the psychological distress in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures. Seventeen point four percent of the participants had overall IES-R score from 24 to 32 indicating that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a clinical concern, while 33.5% had overall IES-R score >32 indicating that PTSD is a probable diagnosis. Females, Cyprus residents, participants that live with elderly people or patients with a chronic disease in home, participants with a mental health disease or/and chronic disease, participants under pharmaceutical treatment, participants that lost their work due to the pandemic and participants that work in hospital experienced greater distress. Also, increased age and decreased educational level was associated with increased distress. Findings suggest that our sample experienced great distress and this distress was affected by several demographic, clinical and job characteristics. Appropriate interventions should be established in order to support psychologically high risk groups and decrease their distress.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on remote mental healthcare and prescribing in psychiatry","Objectives: The recent COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted mental healthcare delivery, with many services shifting from in-person to remote patient contact. We investigated the impact of the pandemic on the use of remote consultation and on the prescribing of psychiatric medications. Design and setting: The Clinical Record Interactive Search tool (CRIS) was used to examine de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) of people receiving mental healthcare from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) NHS Foundation Trust. Data from the period before and after the onset of the pandemic were analysed using linear regression, and visualised using locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS). Participants: All patients receiving care from SLaM between 7th January 2019 and 20th September 2020 (around 37,500 patients per week). Outcome measures: i) The number of clinical contacts (in-person, remote or non-attended) with mental healthcare professionals per week ii) Prescribing of antipsychotic and mood stabiliser medications per week Results: Following the onset of the pandemic, the frequency of in-person contacts was significantly reduced compared to that in the previous year ({beta} coefficient: -5829.6 contacts, 95% CI -6919.5 to -4739.6, p<0.001), while the frequency of remote contacts significantly increased ({beta} coefficient: 3338.5 contacts, 95% CI 3074.4 to 3602.7, p<0.001). Rates of remote consultation were lower in older adults than in working age adults, children and adolescents. Despite this change in the type of patient contact, antipsychotic and mood stabiliser prescribing remained at similar levels. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a marked increase in remote consultation, particularly among younger patients. However, there was no evidence that this has led to changes in psychiatric prescribing. Nevertheless, further work is needed to ensure that older patients are able to access mental healthcare remotely.","Rashmi Patel; Jessica Irving; Aimee Brinn; Matthew Broadbent; Hitesh Shetty; Megan Pritchard; Johnny Downs; Robert Stewart; Robert Harland; Philip McGuire","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.26.20219576","20201027",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Economic and social impacts of COVID-19 and public health measures: results from an anonymous online survey in Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia","In the absence of a vaccine and widely available treatments for COVID-19, governments have relied primarily on non-pharmaceutical interventions to curb the pandemic. To aid understanding of the impact of these public health measures on different social groups we conducted a mixed-methods study in five countries ('SEBCOV' - Social, ethical and behavioural aspects of COVID-19). Here we report the results of the SEBCOV anonymous online survey of adults. Overall, 5,058 respondents from Thailand, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, Italy and Slovenia completed the self-administered survey between May and June 2020. Post-stratification weighting was applied, and associations between categorical variables assessed. Among the five countries, Thai respondents appeared to have been most, and Slovenian respondents least, affected economically. Overall, lower education levels, larger households, having children under 18 in the household, being 65 years or older and having flexible/no income were associated with worse economic impact. Regarding social impact, respondents expressed most concern about their social life, physical health, and mental health and wellbeing. There were large differences between countries in terms of voluntary behavioural change, and in compliance and agreement with COVID-19 restrictions. Overall, self-reported compliance was higher among respondents reporting a high understanding of COVID-19. UK respondents felt able to cope the longest and Thai respondents the shortest with only going out for essential needs or work, with 60% and 26% respectively able to cope with 29 days or longer. Many respondents reported seeing news that seemed fake to them, the proportion varying between countries, and with education level and self-reported levels of understanding of COVID-19. Our data showed that COVID-19 public health measures have uneven economic and social impacts on people from different countries and social groups. Understanding the factors associated with these impacts can help to inform future public health interventions and mitigate their negative consequences on people's lives.","Anne Osterrieder; Giulia Cuman; Wirichada Pan-ngum; Phaik Kin Cheah; Phee-Kheng Cheah; Pimnara Peerawaranun; Margherita Silan; Miha Orazem; Ksenija Perkovic; Urh Groselj; Mira Leonie Schneiders; Tassawan Poomchaichote; Naomi Waithira; Supa-at Asarath; Bhensri Naemiratch; Supanat Ruangkajorn; Lenart Skof; Natinee Kulpijit; Constance R.S.

"Mortality among Adults Ages 25-44 in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic","IntroductionCoronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) has caused a marked increase in all-cause deaths in the United States, mostly among adults aged 65 and older. Because younger adults have far lower infection fatality rates, less attention has been focused on the mortality burden of COVID-19 in this demographic.

MethodsWe performed an observational cohort study using public data from the National Center for Health Statistics at the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and CDC Wonder. We analyzed all-cause mortality among adults ages 25-44 during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Further, we compared COVID-19-related deaths in this age group during the pandemic period to all drug overdose deaths and opioid-specific overdose deaths in each of the ten Health and Human Services (HHS) regions during the corresponding period of 2018, the most recent year for which data are available.

ResultsAs of September 6, 2020, 74,027 all-cause deaths occurred among persons ages 25-44 years during the period from March 1st to July 31st, 2020, 14,155 more than during the same period of 2019, a 23% relative increase (incident rate ratio 1.23; 95% CI 1.21-1.24), with a peak of 30% occurring in May (IRR 1.30; 95% CI 1.27-1.33). In HHS Region 2 (New York, New Jersey), HHS Region 6 (Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas), and HHS Region 9 (Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada), COVID-19 deaths exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid overdose deaths during at least one month. Combined, 2,450 COVID-19 deaths were recorded in these three regions during the pandemic period, compared to 2,445 opioid deaths during the same period of 2018.

MeaningWe find that COVID-19 has likely become the leading cause of death--surpassing unintentional overdoses--among young adults aged 25-44 in some areas of the United States during substantial COVID-19 outbreaks.

NoteThe data presented here have since been updated. As a result, an additional 1,902 all-cause deaths occurring among US adults ages 25-44 during the period of interest are not accounted for in this manuscript.","Jeremy S Faust; Harlan Krumholz; Katherine L Dickerson; Zhenqiu Lin; Cleavon Gilman; Rochelle P.

"Predictors of PTSD, depression and anxiety in UK frontline health and social care workers during COVID-19","ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to identify demographic, work-related and other predictors for clinically significant psychological distress, including PTSD, depression, and/or anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic in UK frontline health and social care workers (HSCWs), and to compare rates of PTSD, depression and anxiety across different groups of HCSWs.

DesignAn online survey was conducted in the weeks following the initial peak in cases (27 May - 23 July 2020).

SettingThe participants worked in a variety of healthcare roles UK hospitals, nursing or care homes and community settings.

ParticipantsA convenience sample (n=1194) of frontline UK health and social care workers completed the survey (including allied healthcare professionals, carers, clinical support staff, nurses and midwives, and other health and social care roles).

Main outcome measuresPTSD was assessed using the PTSD subscale of the International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ); Depression assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9); Anxiety was assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7).

ResultsLogistic regression analyses examined predictors for depression, anxiety and PTSD separately, and also investigated the predictors of meeting the criteria for at least one of the three conditions. Over 57% of respondents met the threshold for clinically significant PTSD, anxiety or depression, and symptom levels were reasonably high and comparable across occupational groups. Participants who were more concerned about infecting others, who felt they could not talk with their managers, who reported feeling stigmatised due to their role and who had not had reliable access to personal protective equipment (PPE) were more likely to meet criteria for a clinically significant mental disorder. Being redeployed during the pandemic,and having had COVID were associated with a higher likelihood of meeting criteria for PTSD. Higher household income was associated with reduced odds for a mental disorder.

ConclusionsThis study identifies predictors of clinically significant distress during COVID-19 and highlights the need for reliable access to PPE. Further research should investigate mental disorders in under-represented HSCW groups and examine barriers to communication between managers and staff. Identifying risk factors for PTSD, depression and anxiety among HSCWs, and providing treatment for those who need it, is critical given that subsequent waves of COVID-19 and other healthcare crises are inevitable.","Talya Greene; Jasmine Harju-Seppanen; Mariam Adjeniji; Charlotte Steel; Nick Grey; Chris R Brewin; Michael A Bloomfield; Jo Billings","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216804","20201025",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Associations between Affect, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Among US Children During COVID-19","We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sixty-four typically-developing children (63% girls) age 9-15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of ""stay-at-home"" measures between April 22 - July 29, 2020. Children completed 24-hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS-C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods.

Statement of RelevanceThere is increasing concern regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the psychological and physical health of children. To date, studies on mental health during the pandemic in children are limited. We investigated links between activity levels and psychological outcomes in children during the height of the ""stay-at-home"" measures. We found that children had anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than normative values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic, and 94% of children exceeded the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations on leisure screen time. Positive affect and physical activity were associated with reduced anxiety levels in children during the pandemic. These findings highlight the important mental health benefits of maintaining positive affect, engaging in physical activity, and limiting leisure screen time for children, especially during stressful periods.","Jasmin M Alves; Alexandra G Yunker; Alexis W Defendis; Anny H Xiang; Katie A Page","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216424","20201023",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Anti-vaccine attitudes and risk factors for not agreeing to vaccination against COVID-19 amongst 32,361 UK adults: Implications for public health communications","BackgroundNegative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults.

MethodsData were from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19.

Findings16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust or misinformation about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 22% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low income (< {pound}30,000 a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of vaccine benefit mistrust and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.

InterpretationNegative attitudes towards vaccines are major public health concerns in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns.

FundingThe Nuffield Foundation [WEL/FR-000022583], the MARCH Mental Health Network funded by the Cross-Disciplinary Mental Health Network Plus initiative supported by UK Research and Innovation [ES/S002588/1], and the Wellcome Trust [221400/Z/20/Z and 205407/Z/16/Z].

O_TEXTBOXEvidence before this studyWe searched PubMed for articles published in English from 1 January 2020 to 20 September 2020 with the following keywords: (""COVID19 vaccine"" OR ""coronavirus vaccine"") and (""intent*"" OR ""refusal""). Our search found 639 titles. Several previous studies have examined predictors of intent to vaccinate for COVID-19 when it becomes available. Reasons for unwillingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccination when it becomes available centred on concerns about its newness, safety, and potential side effects. However, estimates and predictors of negative vaccine attitudes in general and how these attitudes predict uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate in the context of COVID-19 are unavailable.

Added value of this studyThe attitudinal and behavioural barriers to being unsure about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine and not intending to receive one were largely overlapping; 1) didnt get a flu vaccine last year, 2) poor adherence to government guidelines, 3) concerns about the unforeseen future effects of vaccines, and 4) and general mistrust in the benefits of vaccines.

Implications of all of the available evidenceMistrust towards vaccines represent a significant challenge in achieving the vaccination coverage required for population immunity. Taken together, there is evidence that groups most vulnerable to falling ill and dying of COVID-19 (e.g. those from ethnic minority backgrounds and who have lower incomes) have more negative attitudes towards vaccines and are less willing to vaccinate against COVID-19. Not everyone who intends to receive a COVID-19 vaccination will be able to do so because of practical barriers such as lack of accessibility and government decisions on the availability of the vaccine, underscoring the importance of improving vaccine attitudes in the general population to improve vaccine uptake amongst those who are offered a vaccine and prevent widening socio-economic health inequalities. Vaccine safety communication to increase public trust by the time a COVID-19 vaccine is available should begin now.

"Trends in suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in a major German city","BackgroundIt remains unclear whether the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates. Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide.

MethodsData on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019.

OutcomesA total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020.

In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, {chi}2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, {chi}2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found.

InterpretationSR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized.

"Broad transcriptional dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types with COVID-19","Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity1-3. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans4--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression. Our findings and public dataset provide a molecular framework and new opportunities to understand COVID-19 related neurological disease.","Andrew Chris Yang; Fabian Kern; Patricia M Losada; Christina A Maat; Georges Schmartz; Tobias Fehlmann; Nicholas Schaum; Davis P Lee; Kruti Calcuttawala; Ryan T Vest; David Gate; Daniela Berdnik; M.

Longitudinal analyses of 51,000 UK adults","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete, and existing studies provide limited understanding of what factors influence compliance; in particular modifiable factors. We use weekly panel data from 51,000 adults across the first three months of lockdown in the UK to identify factors that are related to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We find evidence that increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance. Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained, something which has not occurred in all countries.","Liam Wright; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215376","20201021",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Experiences of Women Who Gave Birth in US Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study was to describe the experiences of women who gave birth in a US hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Women who gave birth between March and July 2020 completed a survey on the experience of giving birth during a pandemic. 885 women were consented and participated in the study. 22.5% of women reported hypertension, 33.8% reported anxiety, 18.6% reported depression, and 1.13% reported testing positive for COVID-19. 61% of women reported inadequate support for childbirth, and 20.5% reported that they did not feel safe giving birth in the hospital. Women who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to be of Asian race, have a cesarean section, not have a birth partner present, and discontinue breastfeeding before 6 weeks.

Pandemic related changes to maternity care practices may have impacted birthing womens perceptions of safety and support in the hospital environment and affected symptoms of stress. Healthcare policy and maternity care practices should promote feelings of safety and control and overall experience for women giving birth in the hospital during a pandemic.","Elizabeth Mollard; Amaya Wittmaack","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213504","20201020",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Suicide and Self Harm among Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department of a Teaching Hospital in Nepal","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that is not just limited to the physical consequences but also a significant degree of a mental health crisis. Self-harm (SH) and suicide are its extreme effects. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence and clinical profile of suicide and SH in our ED.

MethodsThis is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. Records of all fatal and nonfatal SH patients presenting to the ED during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) was included by searching the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The prevalence and the clinical profile of the patients were compared between these three periods.

ResultsA total of 125 (periods 1=55, 2=38, and 3=32) suicide and SH cases were analyzed. The cases of suicide/SH had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown period in comparison to the period 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p-value=0.045) with increased hospital admission (p-value =0.009) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6 % and 3.1%) (p-value=.001).

ConclusionWe found an increase in patients presenting with suicide and SH in our ED during the pandemic which is likely to reflect an increased prevalence of mental illness in the community. We hope that the result will prime all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.","Roshana Shrestha; Shisir Siwakoti; Saumya Singh; Anmol Purna Shrestha","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769","20201020",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on mental health of children and adolescents in Greece","BackgroundMental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown measures are expected to be profound.

AimThe aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on childrens and adolescents mental health in Greece.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 1,232 Greek parents of children and adolescents aged < 18 years was conducted in March and May 2020. Parents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, family everyday life during the lockdown and the pandemic psychological impact on their children.

ResultsApproximately one-third (35.1%) of parents reported that the psychological health of their children was considerably affected. The most significant concern was social isolation. Unemployment, increased family conflicts, no opportunity for tele-work and a deteriorating psychological health of the parent, as well as childrens previous history of physical health conditions were all significantly associated with adverse mental health impact.

ConclusionA considerable proportion of children and adolescents may experience adverse mental health effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures, and socioeconomic inequalities may be associated with these effects.","Konstantina Magklara; Helen Lazaratou; Anastasia Barbouni; Konstantinos Poulas; Konstantinos Farsalinos; - Coronavirus Greece Research Group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214643","20201020",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"LOCKDOWN FATIGUE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: PREDICTIVE ROLE OF PERSONAL RESILIENCE, COPING BEHAVIOURS, AND HEALTH","BackgroundThe lockdown measures imposed by many countries since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have been useful in slowing the transmission of the disease; however, there is growing concern regarding their adverse consequences on overall health and well-being, particularly among young people. To date, most studies have focused on the mental health consequences of the lockdown measures, while studies assessing how this disease control measure influences the occurrence of fatigue are largely absent.

AimThe aims of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine the levels of lockdown fatigue, and (2) to determine the role of coping behaviours, personal resilience, psychological well-being and perceived health in fatigue associated to the lockdown measure.

MethodsThis is an online cross-sectional study involving 243 college students in the Central Philippines during the sixth month of the lockdown measure implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five standardised scales were used to collect the data.

ResultsOverall, college students reported moderate levels of lockdown fatigue, with a mean score of 31.54 (out of 50). Physical exhaustion or tiredness, headaches and body pain, decreased motivation and increased worry were the most pronounced manifestations of fatigue reported. Gender and college year were identified as important predictors of fatigue. Increased personal resilience and coping skills were associated with lower levels of lockdown fatigue.

ConclusionCollege students experience moderate levels of fatigue during the mandatory lockdown or home confinement period. Resilient students and those who perceive higher social support experience lower levels of fatigue during the lockdown period compared to students with low resilience and social support. Lockdown fatigue may be addressed by formulating and implementing interventions to enhance personal resilience and social support among college students.","Leodoro Labrague; Cherry Ann Ballad","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942","20201020",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Suicide Deaths during the Stay-at-Home Advisory in Massachusetts","Many believe that shelter-in-place or stay-at-home policies might cause an increase in so-called deaths of despair. While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described.

This was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination

The incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings.

The observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019.

The stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters. As the pandemic persists, uncertainty about its scope and economic impact may increase. However, our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory period did not occur.","Jeremy Faust; Sejal B Shah; Chengan Du; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343","20201020",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","BackgroundThe medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood.

MethodsFifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments.

FindingsAt 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and a significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls.

InterpretationA significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.

"Drug synergy of combinatory treatment with remdesivir and the repurposed drugs fluoxetine and itraconazole effectively impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro","The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.","Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410","20201016",NA,"bioRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Athens, Greece","BackgroundThe epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality.

MethodsStudy population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis.

ResultsThe mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age [&ge;]65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality.

ConclusionOur finding of a beneficial effect of allergies and influenza vaccination against COVID-19 infection merits further investigation, as it may shed light in the mechanisms underlying disease progression and severity. Most importantly, it may assist in the implementation of efficient protective measures and public healthcare policies.","Dimitrios Giannoglou; Evangelia Meimeti; Xenia Provatopoulou; Kostantinos Stathopoulos; Kriton-Ioannis Roukas; Petros Galanis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211193","20201014",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on People with Hypertension","ObjectivesIt is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed.

DesignThis retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions.

MethodsBaseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured.

ResultsAt baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%).

ConclusionsAnxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.","Carissa Bonner; Erin Cvejic; Julie Ayre; Jennifer Isautier; Christopher Semsarian; Brooke Nickel; Carys Batcup; Kristen Pickles; Rachael Dodd; Samuel Cornell; Tessa Copp; Kirsten J McCaffery","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722","20201014",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health service activity during COVID-19 lockdown among individuals with learning disabilities: South London and Maudsley data on services and mortality from January to July 2020","The lockdown and social distancing policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have had a widespread impact on mental healthcare service provision and use. Previous reports from the South London and Maudsley NHS Trust (SLaM; a large mental health service provider for 1.2m residents in South London) highlighted a shift to virtual contacts among those accessing community mental health and home treatment teams and an increase in deaths over the pandemics first wave. However, there is a need to quantify this for individuals with particular vulnerabilities, including those with learning disabilities and other neurodevelopmental disorders. Taking advantage of the Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) data resource with 24-hourly updates of electronic mental health records data, this paper describes daily caseloads and contact numbers (face-to-face and virtual) for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders across community, specialist, crisis and inpatient services. The report focussed on the period 1st January to 31st July 2020. We also report on daily accepted and discharged trust referrals, total trust caseloads and daily inpatient admissions and discharges for individuals with potential neurodevelopmental disorders. In addition, daily deaths are described for all current and previous SLaM service users with potential neurodevelopmental disorders over this period. In summary, comparing periods before and after 16th March 2020 there was a shift from face-to-face contacts to virtual contacts across all teams. The largest declines in caseloads and total contacts were seen in Home Treatment Team, Liaison/A&E and Older Adult teams. Reduced accepted referrals and inpatient admissions were observed and there was an 103% increase in average daily deaths in the period after 16th March, compared to the period 1st January to 15th March (or a 282% increase if the 2-month period from 16th March to 15th May was considered alone).","Evangelia Martin; Eleanor Nuzum; Matthew Broadbent; Robert Stewart","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.11.20210625","20201013",NA,"medRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The Caregiver Experience After Stroke in a COVID-19 Environment: A Qualitative Study in Inpatient Rehabilitation","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States  Two-thirds of stroke survivors will require caregiver assistance  Evidence suggests the mental health of caregivers is closely related to patients' health outcomes  The timing of this study intersected with the beginning of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that required strict social distancing and hospital visitor policy changes  This study aims to answer the primary research question: What is the level and nature of stress experienced by caregivers of persons with newly-acquired stroke in the inpatient rehabilitation setting and how has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the caregiver experience? METHODS: Recruitment occurred from a single inpatient rehabilitation facility  Participants were administered the Perceived Stress Scale and then completed qualitative semistructured interviews  The investigators used a phenomenological, iterative approach to collect and analyze qualitative data  The data were independently coded and categorized before consolidated into primary themes and subthemes  RESULTS: Eleven informal caregivers' perspectives generated 13 subthemes across 4 primary thematic categories: COVID-19 impact, concerns of the caregiver, coping strategies, and important aspects of the caregiver experience  COVID-19 social distancing necessitated new visitor policies, which presented additional challenges for caregivers  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver attendance at therapy sessions and frequent, direct communication between staff and caregivers improved caregiver readiness for family member discharge following inpatient rehabilitation  This study shared perspectives from a distinctive time during the COVID-19 pandemic  If visitation for multiple therapy sessions is prohibited, we recommend taking alternative measures to keep the caregiver involved in the plan of care Video Abstract available for more insights from the authors (see the Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, available at: http://links lww com/JNPT/A326)","Sutter-Leve, R.; Passint, E.; Ness, D.; Rindflesch, A.","https://doi.org/10.1097/npt.0000000000000336",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: J Neurol Phys Ther;2020.; Publication details: J Neurol Phys Ther;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Rapid Report 2: Symptoms of anxiety and depression during the first 12 weeks of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia","Background The MindSpot Clinic, funded by the Australian Government, is a national digital mental health service (DMHS) providing services to people experiencing anxiety and depression  We recently reported increased service use in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic (19 March to 15 April 2020), and a small increase in anxiety symptoms  This follow-up paper examines trends in service use and symptoms, over 12 weeks from 19 March to 10 June 2020  Methods Demographics, symptoms, and psychosocial stressors were compared for participants starting an online assessment over four time-periods: A baseline “Comparison period” prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (1 to 28 September 2019), “Weeks 1 - 4” of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia (19 March - 15 April 2020), “Weeks 5 – 8” (16 April – 13 May 2020) and “Weeks 9 - 12” (14 May – 10 June)  Responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 and strategies used by participants to improve their mental wellbeing are also reported  Results A total of 5,455 people started a mental health assessment with MindSpot from 19 March to 10 June 2020  The number of assessments per week rose steadily from 303 in week 1 to a peak of 578 in week 5  Symptoms of anxiety were highest in Weeks 1 - 4, declining steadily over subsequent weeks  Psychological distress and depression, as measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9 respectively, remained stable  Concern about COVID-19 was highest in the first week then steadily declined during the following weeks  The proportions of participants reporting changes to routine were consistent across the 12 weeks, and most participants reported adopting helpful strategies to improve their mental wellbeing  Conclusions We observed an initial increase in service use, which reduced over the 12 weeks  The initial rise in anxiety symptoms returned to baseline  Reported concern about the effect of COVID-19 declined steadily over 12 weeks  Symptoms of psychological distress and depression measured by the K-10 and PHQ-9, and the proportion reporting suicidal thoughts and plans did not change, and to date we have not identified indications of a mental health crisis  However, the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the economy and large sections of society are yet to be fully realised, indicating the importance of ongoing monitoring and reporting of trends as indicators of the mental health of the nation","Staples, Lauren, Nielssen, Olav, Kayrouz, Rony, Cross, Shane, Karin, Eyal, Ryan, Katie, Dear, Blake, Titov, Nickolai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100351",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Internet Interventions;: 100351, 2020.; Publication details: Internet Interventions;: 100351, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Roles of Emergency Managers and Emergency Social Services Directors to Support Disaster Risk Reduction in Canada","Emergency managers (EMs) and Emergency Social Services Directors (ESSDs) are essential service providers who fulfill critical roles in disaster risk reduction  Despite being positioned throughout all levels of government, and in the private sector, EMs and ESSDs fulfill roles which occur largely behind the scenes  The purpose of this phenomenological study was to explore the roles of EMs and ESSDs from different regions across Canada  Specifically, we wanted to understand their perceptions of barriers, vulnerabilities and capabilities within the context of their roles  EMs (n=15) and ESSDs (n=6) from six Canadian provinces participated in semi-structured telephone interviews  Through content analysis, five themes and one model were generated from the data: 1) Emergency management is not synonymous with first response, 2) Unrealistic expectations for a “side-of-desk” role, 3) Minding the gap between academia and practice with a ‘whole-society’ approach, 4) Personal preparedness tends to be weak, 5) Behind the scenes roles can have mental health implications  We present a model, based on these themes, which makes explicit the occupational risks that EMs and ESSDs may encounter in carrying out the skills, tasks, and roles of their jobs  Identification of occupational risks is a first step towards reducing vulnerabilities and supporting capability  This is particularly relevant in our current society as increased demands placed on these professionals coincides with the increasing frequency and severity of natural disasters due to climate change and the emergence of the world wide COVID-19 pandemic","Oostlander, Samantha A.; Bournival, Vanessa, O’Sullivan, Tracey L.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101925",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction;: 101925, 2020.; Publication details: International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction;: 101925, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Probiotics in Treatment of Viral Respiratory Infections and Neuroinflammatory Disorders","Inflammation is a biological response to the activation of the immune system by various infectious or non-infectious agents, which may lead to tissue damage and various diseases  Gut commensal bacteria maintain a symbiotic relationship with the host and display a critical function in the homeostasis of the host immune system  Disturbance to the gut microbiota leads to immune dysfunction both locally and at distant sites, which causes inflammatory conditions not only in the intestine but also in the other organs such as lungs and brain, and may induce a disease state  Probiotics are well known to reinforce immunity and counteract inflammation by restoring symbiosis within the gut microbiota  As a result, probiotics protect against various diseases, including respiratory infections and neuroinflammatory disorders  A growing body of research supports the beneficial role of probiotics in lung and mental health through modulating the gut-lung and gut-brain axes  In the current paper, we discuss the potential role of probiotics in the treatment of viral respiratory infections, including the COVID-19 disease, as major public health crisis in 2020, and influenza virus infection, as well as treatment of neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis and other mental illnesses","Shahbazi, Roghayeh, Yasavoli-Sharahi, Hamed, Alsadi, Nawal, Ismail, Nafissa, Matar, Chantal","https://www.google.com/search?q=Probiotics+in+Treatment+of+Viral+Respiratory+Infections+and+Neuroinflammatory+Disorders",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Molecules;25(21):4891, 2020.; Publication details: Molecules;25(21):4891, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Investigating the Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on the Psychological Health of University Students and Their Attitudes Toward Mobile Mental Health Solutions: Two-Part Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak was first reported to the World Health Organization on December 31, 2019, and it was officially declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. The COVID-19 outbreak and the safety measures taken to control it caused many psychological issues in populations worldwide, such as depression, anxiety, and stress. OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to assess the psychological effects of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak on university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to investigate the students' awareness of mobile mental health care apps as well as their attitudes toward the use of these apps. METHODS: A two-part self-administered web-based questionnaire was delivered to students at United Arab Emirates University. The first part of the questionnaire assessed the mental state of the participants using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), while the second part contained questions investigating the participants' awareness of and attitudes toward mental health care apps. Students were invited to fill out the web-based questionnaire via social media and mailing lists. RESULTS: A total of 154 students participated in the survey, and the majority were female. The results of the GHQ-12 analysis showed that the students were experiencing psychological issues related to depression and anxiety as well as social dysfunction. The results also revealed a lack of awareness of mental health care apps and uncertainty regarding the use of such apps. Approximately one-third of the participants (44/154, 28.6%) suggested preferred functionalities and characteristics of mobile mental health care apps, such as affordable price, simple design, ease of use, web-based therapy, communication with others experiencing the same issues, and tracking of mental status. CONCLUSIONS: Like many groups of people worldwide, university students in the UAE were psychologically affected by the lockdown due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Although apps can be useful tools for mental health care delivery, especially in circumstances such as those produced by the outbreak, the students in this study showed a lack of awareness of these apps and mixed attitudes toward them. Improving the digital health literacy of university students in the UAE by increasing their awareness of mental health care apps and the treatment methods and benefits of the apps, as well as involving students in the app creation process, may encourage students to use these tools for mental health care.","Drissi, Nidal; Alhmoudi, Ayat; Al Nuaimi, Hana; Alkhyeli, Mahra; Alsalami, Shaikha; Ouhbi, Sofia","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19876",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e19876, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e19876, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Old age mental health services in Southern Balkans: Features, geospatial distribution, current needs, and future perspectives","BACKGROUND: Healthcare services are increasingly confronted with challenges related to old age mental disorders. The survey aimed to provide an overview of existing psychogeriatric services in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, and North Macedonia. METHODS: After identification of psychogeriatric units across the four countries, their head physicians were asked to provide data on their clinical, teaching, and research activity, as well as staff composition. Moreover, the attitudes of head physicians to current needs and future service development were explored. RESULTS: A total of 15 psychogeriatric units were identified (3 in Bulgaria, 8 in Greece, and 4 in North Macedonia). Results show wide variation regarding the location, team size and composition, service availability, numbers of patients attending, and inpatient treatment length. Most head physicians underscored the urgent need for breakthroughs in the graduate and postgraduate education in psychogeriatrics of medical and nonmedical professionals, as well as in the interconnection of their units with community primary healthcare services and long-term care facilities for seniors via telemedicine. They would welcome the development of national standards for psychogeriatric units, potentially embodying clear pointers for action. A number of head physicians advocated the development of nationwide old age mental health registries. CONCLUSIONS: Regional disparities in resources and services for seniors' mental health services were unveiled. These data may enrich the dialogue on optimizing psychogeriatric services through planning future cross-border collaborations mainly based on telemedicine services, especially in the era of the novel coronavirus pandemic, and training/education in psychogeriatrics of mental health professionals.","Alexopoulos, P; Novotni, A; Novotni, G; Vorvolakos, T; Vratsista, A; Konsta, A; Kaprinis, S; Konstantinou, A; Bonotis, K; Katirtzoglou, E; Siarkos, K; Bekri, E S; Kokkoris, I; Como, A; Gournellis, R; Stoyanov, D S; Politis, A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2020.85",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;63(1): e88, 2020 09 14.; Publication details: Eur Psychiatry;63(1): e88, 2020 09 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Associations between Affect, Physical Activity, and Anxiety Among US Children During COVID-19","We investigated how emotional responses (positive and negative affect), physical activity (PA), and sedentary behaviors related to anxiety among US children during the COVID 19 pandemic. Sixty four typically developing children (63% girls) age 9 to 15 years old completed two virtual visits during height of stay at home measures between April 22 to July 29, 2020. Children completed 24 hour PA recalls, state portion of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC), and the shortened 10 item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule for Children (PANAS C). Children reported state anxiety scores that were more than 5 standard deviations greater than values from healthy pediatric populations prior to the pandemic. Children with higher positive affect and who reported more time in PA reported less state anxiety. Sedentary and leisure screen time were positively correlated with negative affect. Our findings suggest that maintaining positive affect, engaging in PA, and limiting leisure screen time may be important for child mental health during stressful periods.","Jasmin M Alves; Alexandra G Yunker; Alexis W Defendis; Anny H Xiang; Katie A Page","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20216424",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

However, the situation of refugees in developing countries is unclear. Thus, this study estimated the prevalence of and associated demographic factors during COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology employed a cross-sectional survey carried out in June 2020 in which 146 adult refugees from Nakivale settlement camp were randomly selected to fill out a questionnaires-demographics and PHQ9. Results revealed that the majority of respondents were female (53%) and 47% had a depressive disorder. There was no statistical relationship between demographics (gender, age and marital status) and depressive disorders. In Conclusion, findings indicate that depressive disorders are prevalent among refugees in Nakivale settlement and it is important to identify refugees affected mentally and given proper treatment.","Lucas Goodgame Anyayo; Amir Kabunga","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20216754",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Anti-vaccine attitudes and risk factors for not agreeing to vaccination against COVID-19 amongst 32,361 UK adults: Implications for public health communications","Background Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults. Methods Data were from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial logistic regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19. Findings 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust or misinformation about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 22% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low income (< 30,000 GBP a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of vaccine benefit mistrust and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19. Interpretation Negative attitudes towards vaccines are major public health concerns in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns.

"Trends in suicide rates during the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in a major German city","Background It remains unclear whether the COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on suicide rates. Social distancing, economic insecurity and increasing prevalence rates of mental disorders may cause an increase in risk factors for suicide. Methods Data on suicide events in a major city in Germany, and the corresponding life years were provided by the local authorities. For the year 2020, periods without restrictions on freedom of movement and social contact were compared with periods of moderate and severe COVID-19 restrictions. To avoid distortions due to seasonal fluctuations in suicide risk, data from 2020 were compared to data from 2010 to 2019. Outcomes A total of 333 suicides were registered and 2,791,131 life years (LY) were spent between 2010 and 2020. Of these, 42 suicides and 300,834 LY accounted for the year 2020. In 2020, suicide rates (SR, suicides per 100,000 LY) were lower in periods with moderate (SR = 8.5, X^2 = 4.374, p = 0.037) or severe COVID-19 restrictions (SR = 7.0, X^2 = 3.999, p = 0.046) compared with periods without restrictions (SR = 18.0). A comparison with preceding years showed that differences cannot be attributed to seasonal variations. No age- or gender differences were found. Interpretation SR decreased during the COVID-19 restrictions; we expect SR to rise in the medium term. Careful monitoring of SR in the further course of the COVID-19 crisis is therefore urgently needed. The findings have regional reference and should not be over-generalized. Funding This study was conducted without external funding.","Daniel Radeloff; Rainer Papsdorf; Kirsten Uhlig; Andreas Vasilache; Karen Putnam; Kai von Klitzing","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.21.20187419",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Influence of anti-osteoporosis treatments on the incidence of COVID-19 in patients with non-inflammatory rheumatic conditions","Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is currently a global pandemic that affects patients with other pathologies. Here, we investigated the influence of treatments for osteoporosis and other non-inflammatory rheumatic conditions, such as osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia, on COVID-19 incidence. To this end, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,102 patients being treated at the Rheumatology Service of Hospital del Mar (Barcelona, Spain). In our cohort, COVID-19 cumulative incidence from March 1 to May 3, 2020 was compared to population estimates for the same city. We used Poisson regression models to determine the adjusted relative risk ratios for COVID-19 associated with different treatments and comorbidities. Denosumab, zoledronate and calcium were negatively associated with COVID-19 incidence. Some analgesics, particularly pregabalin and most of the studied antidepressants, were positively associated with COVID-19 incidence, whereas duloxetine presented a negative association. Oral bisphosphonates, vitamin D, thiazide diuretics, anti-hypertensive drugs and chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on COVID-19 incidence in the studied population.

"Psychological and Coping Responses of Health Care Workers Toward Emerging Infectious Disease Outbreaks: A Rapid Review and Practical Implications for the COVID-19 Pandemic","OBJECTIVE: In light of the current evolving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and the need to learn from past infectious disease outbreaks to provide better psychological support for our frontline health care workers (HCW), we conducted a rapid review of extant studies that have reported on both psychological and coping responses in HCW during recent outbreaks. DATA SOURCES: We performed a systematic search of the available literature using PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), and Web of Science, combining key terms regarding recent infectious disease outbreaks and psychological and coping responses. Papers published from database inception to April 20, 2020, were considered for inclusion. Only studies in the English language and papers from peer-reviewed journals were included. STUDY SELECTION: We identified 95 (PubMed) and 49 papers (Web of Science) from the database search, of which 23 papers were eventually included in the review. DATA EXTRACTION: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were used for data extraction. The McMaster University critical appraisal tool was used to appraise quantitative studies. Guidelines by Higginbotham and colleagues were used to appraise qualitative studies. Only studies exploring the combined psychological and coping responses of HCW amid infectious diseases were included. RESULTS: Salient psychological responses that can persist beyond the outbreaks included anxiety/fears, stigmatization, depression, posttraumatic stress, anger/frustration, grief, and burnout, but also positive growth and transformation. Personal coping methods (such as problem solving, seeking social support, and positive thinking) alongside workplace measures (including infection control and safety, staff support and recognition, and clear communication) were reported to be helpful. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological support for HCW in the current COVID-19 pandemic and future outbreaks should focus on both individual (eg, psychoeducation on possible psychological responses, self-care) and institutional (eg, clear communication, providing access to resources for help, recognition of efforts of HCW) measures.","Chew, Qian Hui; Wei, Ker Chiah; Vasoo, Shawn; Sim, Kang","https://dx.doi.org/10.4088/JCP.20r13450",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Clin Psychiatry;81(6)2020 Oct 20.; Publication details: J Clin Psychiatry;81(6)2020 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The immediate effect of COVID-19 pandemic on children and adolescents with obsessive compulsive disorder","BACKGROUND: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a distressing psychiatric disorder. Traumas may trigger or aggravate OCD symptoms. COVID-19 pandemic has coursed a global crisis and has been associated with onset of psychiatric disorders in adults. Little is known about children/adolescents with OCD. The present study aimed to examine how children/adolescents with OCD react towards COVID-19 crisis. METHODS: A questionnaire was distributed to two separate groups of children/adolescents. One group was a clinical group newly diagnosed at a specialized OCD clinic. All the children/adolescents had a current close contact to a therapist or doctor. The other group was a survey group identified through the Danish OCD Association. Most of these children/adolescents were diagnosed years ago, and their primary treatment was completed. For the clinical group, data from patient files was available. RESULTS: In both groups, but most pronounced in the survey group, participants experienced a worsening of their OCD, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The aggravation of OCD correlated with the worsening of anxiety, depressive symptoms, and the extent of avoidance behavior. For both groups, OCD aggressive symptoms predicted a significant worsening. Poor baseline insight showed a trend to predict a symptom worsening. The worsening was most pronounced in children with early age of onset and a family history of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies examining the effect of COVID-19 in children/adolescents with OCD. The effect was examined in two separate populations strengthening the findings. The study points towards an influence of the OCD phenotype, baseline insight suggesting a continued vulnerability, and a family history of psychiatric disorders. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency (1-16-02-147-20) registered 1st of April 2020. Oral and written information was given to parents and patients and written consent from patients over 15 years and parents were received.","Nissen, J B; Højgaard, D R M A; Thomsen, P H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12888-020-02905-5",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 511, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication details: BMC Psychiatry;20(1): 511, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Association entre la fréquence de consultation des médias d'information et la détresse psychologique chez les femmes enceintes durant la pandémie de COVID-19: Association between news media consulting frequency and psychological distress in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic","OBJECTIVE: Examine the association between news media use frequency during the COVID-19 pandemic and the scale of psychological distress in pregnant women, considering this distress known harmful effects on the fetus development. METHOD: Pregnant women living in Quebec province (N = 1014) have been recruited in April 2020 through social media, while a state of health emergency was declared. Participants were divided in 4 groups, according to self-reported frequency of news media consulting (little or none; one time a day; several times a day; constant). They filled measures of depressive symptoms, negative affects, post-traumatic stress symptoms and anxiety specific to COVID-19. Instrument scores were grouped under a unique factor of psychological distress. RESULTS: An ANCOVA controlling for age, gestational age, education level, household annual revenue and a diagnosed mental disorder present at the time of participation in study shows that news media exposure frequency is significantly associated with psychological distress severity in pregnant women, during COVID-19 pandemic, F(3,998) = 27.02, p < 0.001, Î·2 partial = 0.08. Given the mean comparisons a posteriori, higher psychological distress rates are found as soon as news media exposure exceeds once a day (effect sizes between 0.38 and 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: The more pregnant women report consulting the news media during the COVID-19 pandemic, the more likely they are to exhibit psychological distress. Results provide one of the first empirical supports to recommendations of World Health Organization, Canada government and psychiatric associations that encourage population to limit their news media consulting during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Roxanne, Lemieux; Julia, Garon-Bissonnette; Mathilde, Loiselle; Élodie, Martel; Christine, Drouin-Maziade; Nicolas, Berthelot","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0706743720963917",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720963917, 2020 Oct 21.; Publication details: Can J Psychiatry;: 706743720963917, 2020 Oct 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

METHODS: Participants were 1380 respondents who completed an online survey. A logistic regression model was used to evaluate the association between the independent variables and perceived symptoms. RESULTS: Participants reported different prevalences of perceived ENT and general symptoms. Coryza, cough, sore throat and tinnitus were the most common symptoms, and there was a low prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress compared with the psychological impact of the symptom. Comparison of the two symptom groups demonstrated a common need for updates, their relationship with the media and correct information about the route of transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The health information provided during a disease outbreak must be grounded in evidence. This would help to prevent adverse psychological reactions and somatization symptoms that can engulf healthcare systems, especially in clinical areas like ENT, which frequently treat airway problems.","Micarelli, Alessandro; Granito, Ivan; Carlino, Pasquale; Micarelli, Beatrice; Alessandrini, Marco","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0300060520961276",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Int Med Res;48(10): 300060520961276, 2020 Oct.; Publication details: J Int Med Res;48(10): 300060520961276, 2020 Oct.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Early Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Acute Care Mental Health Services","OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of COVID-19 and the lockdown measures adopted in England on patients with acute mental illness. METHODS: The authors analyzed referrals to the crisis resolution and home treatment (CRHT) team and inpatient admissions to acute adult wards, at Leicestershire Partnership National Health Service Trust, an integrated community and mental health trust in the United Kingdom. Number of CRHT referrals and inpatient admissions during a 4-week period starting March 16, 2020 (""COVID-19 period""), was studied and compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019 (""control periods""). Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were compared with those admitted during the 2019 control period. RESULTS: The number of CRHT referrals and inpatient admissions were lower during the COVID-19 period, compared with the control periods, by approximately 12% and 20%, respectively. Patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were significantly more often detained under the Mental Health Act and were considered to pose a risk of aggression. The pattern of diagnoses differed significantly between 2020 and 2019. A higher percentage of patients admitted during the COVID-19 period were diagnosed as having nonaffective psychotic disorders (52% versus 35%) or bipolar disorder (25% versus 15%), and fewer received a diagnosis of depression (8% versus 16%), anxiety disorder (0% versus 3%), adjustment disorder (0% versus 8%), emotionally unstable personality disorder (6% versus 15%), or any other personality disorder (0% versus 5%) (p=0.01).

"Rapid ethnographic assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic April 2020 'surge' and its impact on service delivery in an Acute Care Medical Emergency Department and Trauma Center","OBJECTIVES: Assess the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on service delivery by frontline healthcare providers in acute care medical and emergency department settings and identify strategies used to cope with pandemic-related physical and mental health demands. DESIGN: Rapid clinical ethnography of patient-provider encounters during an initial pandemic 'surge' conducted by a team of clinician-researchers using a structured protocol for qualitative data collection and analysis. SETTING: Level 1 trauma centre at Harborview Hospital in Seattle Washington in April 2020. PARTICIPANTS: Frontline clinical providers serving as participant observers during performance of their clinical duties recorded observations and summaries of conversations with other providers and patients. RESULTS: We identified four different kinds of impacts: procedural, provider, patient and overall. Each impact highlighted two or more levels of a socioecological model of services delivery: (1) the epidemiology of COVID-19, (2) outer setting, (3) inner or organisational setting and (4) individual patient and provider. Despite significant changes in procedures that included COVID-19 screening of all admitted patients, social distancing and use of personal protective equipment, as well as changes in patient and provider behaviour, the overall impact of the pandemic on the emergency department and acute care service delivery was minimal. This is attributed to having a smaller surge than expected, a quick response by the healthcare system to anticipated demands for service delivery and protection of patients and providers, adequate supplies and high provider morale. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited to one setting in one healthcare system in one community, the findings offer some important lessons for healthcare systems that have yet to be impacted as well as systems that have been more severely impacted. Each of the socioecological framework levels was found to impact service delivery to patients, and variations at each of these levels account for variations in that quality of care globally.","Palinkas, Lawrence A; Whiteside, Lauren; Nehra, Deepika; Engstrom, Allison; Taylor, Mark; Moloney, Kathleen; Zatzick, Douglas F","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041772",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(10): e041772, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication details: BMJ Open;10(10): e041772, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Child and Family Outcomes Following Pandemics: A Systematic Review and Recommendations on COVID-19 Policies","OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of mental health outcomes and needs of children and families during past pandemics was conducted based on the PRISMA protocol. The objectives were to evaluate the quality of existing studies on this topic, determine what is known about mental health outcomes and needs of children and families, and provide recommendations for how COVID-19 policies can best support children and families. METHODS: Seventeen studies were identified through a search of PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. RESULTS: Studies examining child outcomes indicate that social isolation and quarantining practices exert a substantial negative impact on child anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and fear symptoms. Potential risk factors such as living in rural areas, being female, and increasing grade level may exacerbate negative mental health outcomes for children. Studies examining parental and family outcomes indicate that parents experience high stress, anxiety, and financial burden during pandemics. The age of the parent and family socioeconomic status (SES) appeared to mitigate negative outcomes, where older parents and higher SES families had lower rates of mental health problems. Parents' fear over the physical and mental health of their children, concerns over potential job loss and arranging childcare contributes to elevated stress and poorer well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this review suggest current gaps in COVID-19 policies and provide recommendations such implementing ""family-friendly"" policies that are inclusive and have flexible eligibility criteria. Examples include universal paid sick leave for parents and financial supports for parents who are also frontline workers and are at an elevated risk for contracting the disease.","C Fong, Vanessa; Iarocci, Grace","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa092",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pediatr Psychol;2020 Oct 21.; Publication details: J Pediatr Psychol;2020 Oct 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Short report: factors determining perceived stress among medical staff in radiology departments during the COVID-19 outbreak","Medical staff in radiology departments faces a higher risk of infection and a heavier workload during the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. High perceived stress levels endanger physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is urgent to understand the perceived stress levels of medical staff and explore its risk factors. We recruited 600 medical staff from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China, to evaluate perceived stress scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. The results showed that the perceived stress level among medical staff in the radiology departments during the COVID-19 outbreak was high and a sense of tension was strongly present. A positive correlation was found between anxiety score and perceived stress. Multivariate analysis showed that risk factors for perceived stress were female, existing anxiety, and fears of being infected at work, an uncontrollable outbreak, and not being able to pay rent or mortgage. Conversely, good knowledge about COVID-19, being unmarried, and working in a higher-grade hospital were protective factors for perceived stress. Therefore, more attention should be given to medical staff in the radiology departments that present the risk factors outlined above. Timely risk assessment of psychological stress and effective intervention measures should be taken for these high-risk groups to keep their perceived stress within normal limits.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Chen, Xijian; Xu, Huayan; Guo, Yingkun; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2020.1837390",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Health Med;: 1-6, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication details: Psychol Health Med;: 1-6, 2020 Oct 20.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Spiritual Health and Stress in Pregnant Women During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Stress is one of the effective factors in the occurrence of negative effects during pregnancy that can cause adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery and reduced intrauterine growth of the fetus in pregnant women. Therefore, one of the serious concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic is the physical health and mental health of pregnant women. This study aimed to evaluate the physical health status with the spiritual and mental health of pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study is a descriptive study in 2019-2020 and the samples were randomly selected from all pregnant women who referred to hospitals and private maternity centers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and performed all pregnancy and fetal health tests. It was performed on 560 pregnant female samples. The mental status of pregnant women was assessed using the DASS Spiritual Health and Stress Questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (version 24). The results of this study showed that preterm birth, height, weight, and head circumference of babies and lungs and respiratory status of children with mental health and stress levels of pregnant women during the corona are significant compared with the previous of corona (p < 0.05). Increasing stress and decreasing the mental health of pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic can increase the influencing factors in preterm delivery and unhealthy birth.","Nodoushan, Reza Jafari; Alimoradi, Hadi; Nazari, Mahsa","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42399-020-00582-9",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: SN Compr Clin Med;: 1-7, 2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: SN Compr Clin Med;: 1-7, 2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Cross-Talk between Age, Hypertension and Inflammation in COVID-19 Patients: Therapeutic Targets","This paper presents a brief overview of the complex interaction between age, hypertension, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), inflammation, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is more frequent and more severe in comorbid elderly patients, especially those with hypertension, diabetes, obesity, or cardiovascular diseases. There are concerns regarding the use of RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. Some physicians have considered the need for interrupting RAAS inhibition in order to reduce the possibility of SARS-CoV2 entering lung cells after binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors. We offer a different point of view in relation to the need for continuing to use RAAS inhibitors in patients with COVID-19. We focused our article on elderly patients because of the distinctive imbalance between the immune response, which is depressed, and the exacerbated inflammatory response, 'inflammaging', which makes the geriatric patient an appropriate candidate for therapeutic strategies aimed at modulating the inflammatory response. Indeed, COVID-19 is an inflammatory storm that starts and worsens during the course of the disease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, various therapeutic approaches have been tested, including antiviral drugs, interferon, anti-interleukins, hydroxychloroquine, anti-inflammatories, immunoglobulins from recovered patients, and heparins. Some of these therapeutic approaches did not prove to be beneficial, or even induced serious complications. Based on current evidence, in the early stages of the disease modulation of the inflammatory response through the inhibition of neprilysin and modulation of the RAAS could affect the course and outcome of COVID-19.","Casucci, Gerardo; Acanfora, Domenico; Incalzi, Raffaele Antonelli","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40266-020-00808-4",NA,"Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÂNDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Drugs Aging;2020 Oct 21.; Publication details: Drugs Aging;2020 Oct 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Broad transcriptional dysregulation of brain and choroid plexus cell types with COVID-19","Though SARS-CoV-2 primarily targets the respiratory system, it is increasingly appreciated that patients may suffer neurological symptoms of varied severity. However, an unbiased understanding of the molecular processes across brain cell types that could contribute to these symptoms in COVID-19 patients is still missing. Here, we profile 47,678 droplet-based single-nucleus transcriptomes from the frontal cortex and choroid plexus across 10 non-viral, 4 COVID-19, and 1 influenza patient. We complement transcriptomic data with immunohistochemical staining for the presence of SARS-CoV-2. We find that all major cortex parenchymal and choroid plexus cell types are affected transcriptionally with COVID-19. This arises, in part, from SARS-CoV-2 infection of the cortical brain vasculature, meninges, and choroid plexus, stimulating increased inflammatory signaling into the brain. In parallel, peripheral immune cells infiltrate the brain, microglia activate programs mediating the phagocytosis of live neurons, and astrocytes dysregulate genes involved in neurotransmitter homeostasis. Among neurons, layer 2/3 excitatory neurons--evolutionarily expanded in humans--show a specific downregulation of genes encoding major SNARE and synaptic vesicle components, predicting compromised synaptic transmission. These perturbations are not observed in terminal influenza. Many COVID-19 gene expression changes are shared with those in chronic brain disorders and reside in genetic variants associated with cognitive function, schizophrenia, and depression.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 on the families of first-line rescuers","Under the COVID-19 epidemic, the families of front-line rescue workers are under unusual pressure  We aim to understand the extent of their psychological distress in this epidemic and whether they have received sufficient support  Thus targeted to provide support for them and indirectly reduce the concerns of the rescue workers  From February 27 to March 1, 2020, we used the scales of Perceived Stress Scale, 10-items Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Patient Health Questionnaire-2, and primary care-posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to evaluate the mental health level of the family members of front-line rescue workers online  Six hundred and seventy one family members voluntarily filled out the questionnaire after reading the purpose of the study  A total of 671 family members of front-line rescue workers participated in the survey, including 194 husbands/wives, 52 parents, 49 children, 76 brothers and sisters, and 300 other relationships  Among them, 55% of the family members reported sleep problems, 49 0% of the family members had mild, and above anxiety symptoms, 12 2% of the family members reported clinically significant depression symptoms, and 10 4% of the family members may have PTSD, 8 3% of family members had thoughts of self-injury or suicide  The feeling of stress was positively correlated with anxiety and depression, but there was no significant correlation between psychological elasticity and various symptoms  Family members who are more worried about the safety, physical condition and living security of front-line rescue workers are more likely to report symptoms such as sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression  Family members' first-line rescue has a significant impact on their daily life, raising children and supporting the elderly, which is also related to the occurrence of mental and psychological symptoms  During the period of front-line support, they received support from the units or organizations of the first-line workers, mainly including telephone greetings and daily necessities  The top three concerns about the information of the epidemic were the time of the end of the epidemic, the time of the return of the family and the progress of COVID-19's treatment  After the end of the epidemic, what they most want to do is to pay more attention to and accompany their families, family gatherings, and do more exercise  The psychological impact of this epidemic on the families of front-line rescue workers is mainly sleep problems and anxiety  The psychological intervention of family members should mainly start from the relief of stress and increase of material and spiritual support","Feng, Z.; Xu, L.; Cheng, P.; Zhang, L.; Li, L.

"IVF TREATMENT PRE- AND POST- THE ASRM COVID-19 PAUSE","Objective: The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has forever reshaped the United States health care system  However, assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment remains an essential form of medicine  Reproductive practices have since incorporated vigilant practices regarding social distancing, ample use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and consistent decontamination protocols in order to mitigate risk of COVID-19 infection  Altogether, changes to standard operating procedures within ART treatment centers are anticipated to support patient safety without compromising quality of reproductive care  Finally, there is ample evidence of the mental health burden stemming from this pandemic with regard to anxiety and depression in both healthcare workers and patients  Given the current uncertainty, our study evaluates IVF cycle outcome in a New York City patient cohort prior to and subsequent to the ASRM COVID-19 task force’s recommended treatment pause  Design: Retrospective cohort analysis  Materials and Methods: The study includes patients who underwent a single, euploid frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) from January 1st, 2020 to May 18th, 2020  Cohorts were separated into two groups based on period of IVF treatment (Group 1: Treatment prior to the COVID-19 pandemic pause;Group 2: Treatment subsequent to the COVID-19 pause)  Primary outcome included early pregnancy rates  Chi squared test was used and statistically significance was considered at p= &lt;0 05  Results: A total of 601 single, euploid FET cycles in which pregnancy outcomes coming prior to the COVID-19 pandemic pause (n=526) were compared to outcomes subsequent to COVID-19 (n=75)  No differences were found in early pregnancy rates among cohorts (Table 1)  [Formula presented] Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented burden on patients, physicians, and the entire healthcare system  Urgent treatments, including reproductive care, were postponed, as scarce resources needed to be re-directed  Resumption of treatment required modification in workflow, staffing, decontamination protocols, and utilization of PPE  Although the patient experience has changed, our study is first to demonstrate implantation rates were not compromised in an era of COVID-19  Importantly, our preliminary data suggests that the stress and anxiety that pervade modern COVID-era reproductive care do not alter outcomes  With an abundance of caution, a modern fertility clinic can work to “flatten the curve,” abide by guidelines, and deliver safe and effective patient care","Lee, J.

"COVID-19 and its effect on olympic sport: The importance of studying social isolation and the harm it causes, in order to minimize it","In March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease caused by the SARS-CoV2 virus, known as COVID-19, to be a pandemic  The sporting world, too, is suffering from the global effects of this di-sease, with the postponement or cancellation of competitions, including the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games  As a proposal for containing the disease, social isolation was declared  Despite the importance of this measure, it was harmful for Olympic athletes, as they had to stay away from their training site and trainers, as well as their interdisciplinary teams  It is therefore important to study this harm caused, in order to minimize it  In general, it is believed that regular physical activity is associated with improved immune system functioning  The lack of training can therefore have significant consequences for the performance and health of the Olympic athle-te  From the athlete’s point of view, the impaired immune system, due to the reduced frequency of physical exercise, leaves them more vulnerable to contracting or developing infections or other diseases  The risk of harm due to the decreased performance of preventive works is also evident in this population  The reductions in training load and intensity can cause changes in the athlete’s body composition and affect various aspects of cardiorespiratory fitness, as well as reducing strength levels and muscle potency  In relation to the athlete’s mental health, two aspects are particularly challenging: isolation and uncertainty  Based on the possible harm caused by social isolation, the need is seen for a specific and joint work, in an attempt to minimize it  This work addresses the following topics: (I) context: transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, discharge criteria, isolation and post-pandemic consequences;(II) harm and proposals: nutritional, physiological, biomechanical and psychological  Level of evidence II;Review Article  © 2020, Redprint Editora Ltda  All rights reserved","E Côrte, A.

"Standing on the shoulders of giants: 100 years of neurology and epidemic infections","Histopathology of most cases in the acute phase showed reddish-grey discolouration of the brainstem grey matter with lymphocytic infiltrates surrounding vessels and diffuse inflammation with haemorrhage 1 In the chronic phase, persistent inflammation was evident with generalised brain atrophy and degeneration of the substantia nigra 1 The aetiology remains unproven, and it is not clear whether all the cases in the literature truly represent a single disease 5 The prevailing contemporary hypothesis was that proposed by von Economo himself—that the disease was owing to an infectious agent, although he observed that cases appeared to predate the emergence of the 1918 influenza pandemic 2 5 von Economo’s view that the disease was the result of direct viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS) has now been largely superseded by the proposition that the disease reflected a para/post-infectious inflammatory process 5 Although evidence for this is lacking, it fits neatly with the modern view of other neurological syndromes such as Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antibody encephalitis, the latter of which may be triggered by herpes simplex virus in some 6 7 Indeed, NMDA-R antibodies were present in serum (and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) when available for study) in around 50% of 20 children with dyskinetic ‘encephalitis lethargica’ (collected over many years),8 and antibodies to the dopamine receptor in a proportion of the remaining more akinetic cases  Many of the clinical features overlap, although encephalitis lethargica is more heterogeneous in both its acute symptoms and its natural history 2 A para/postinfectious pathogenesis, rather than direct viral infection, is in keeping with the observations that single members of families were often affected, which puzzled epidemiologists at the time;and that an infectious agent was not readily detected in CSF or brain tissue 2 It is possible that encephalitis lethargica represented a final common pathway of brain inflammation potentially triggered by several different infectious agents, although were this the case the reasons for the disease’s decline remain obscure  A young patient had been admitted in April 1918 with self-inflicted laceration across the neck, preceded by headache and sleeplessness for 2 weeks 10 Six months after the initial presentation, they developed neck and back pain with reduced mobility, 2 months later developing expressive aphasia with retained comprehension, and death occurred less than a month later 10 The postmortem results describe a widespread meningoencephalomyelitis with vascular proliferation, perivascular inflammation, thrombosis, haemorrhage and destruction of nervous tissue 10 A subsequent case series collated by Sir Thomas Horder, also published in 1920, comprises 25 cases described by several neurologists from Bristol, and is notable for detailed and varied descriptions of cases of encephalitis lethargica in patients of all ages 11 Their dilemmas trying to unify these disparate clinical presentations are clearly evident  The 2009 H1N1 pandemic was associated with complications of the nervous system in up to 4% of those diagnosed with H1N1 influenza infection and most commonly included altered mental status, seizures, narcolepsy and encephalopathy, particularly in children 16–18 Several seemingly pathognomic encephalopathy syndromes have emerged, including acute necrotising encephalopathy with bilateral thalamic involvement 16–18 The virus is rarely identified by molecular tests of the CSF in these patients, and it has been suggested that the mechanism for the complications may be a parainfectious cytokine storm 18 Coronaviruses The severe CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and MERS, have been associated with limited reports of both central and peripheral nervous system disease, including ADEM 19 Sporadic, seasonal CoV have also occasionally been implicated in neurological disease 20 COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, represents the most devastating respiratory pandemic since the influenza pandemics of 1918 (‘Spanish flu’;H1N1), 1957 (‘Asian flu’;H2N2) and 1968 (‘Hong Kong flu’;H3N2) 21 Reports of neurological syndromes associated with SARS-CoV2 are frequent, initially reported where the virus began in Wuhan,22 and continued in case reports and series from across the world 21 23 24 A UK-wide surveillance study identified 153 cases with CNS disorders reflecting cerebrovascular events, altered mental status including 7 patients with encephalitis, and a surprising number of psychiatric syndromes, such as psychosis and catatonia 21 It is currently unclear how many cases are causally related to SARS-CoV-2 and in what proportion this is a coincidental infection 23 It is becoming apparent that dysfunction of the clotting cascade, together with possible endotheliopathy, is in some cases associated with cerebrovascular disease in COVID-19 21 23 24 The number of patients with encephalopathy is also striking, and in a few cases the virus has been detected in CSF 21 25 Many cases of GBS and its variants are also emerging 26 Conclusion The historical papers of von Economo, Horder and others are refreshing in their straightforward and detailed accounts of the symptoms","Harriett Van Den, Tooren; Ellul, Mark A.; Davies, Nicholas W.

"Structuring mental health support for frontline caregivers during COVID-19: Lessons from organisational scholarship on unit-aligned support","Background Although the COVID-19 pandemic exposes frontline caregivers to severe prolonged stresses and trauma, there has been little clarity on how healthcare organisations can structure support to address these mental health needs  This article translates organisational scholarship on professionals working in organisations to elucidate why traditional approaches to supporting employee mental health, which often ask employees to seek assistance from centralised resources that separate mental health personnel from frontline units, may be insufficient under crisis conditions  We identify a critical but often overlooked aspect of employee mental health support: how frontline professionals respond to mental health services  In high-risk, high-pressure fields, frontline professionals may perceive mental health support as coming at the expense of urgent frontline work goals (ie, patient care) and as clashing with their central professional identities (ie, as expert, self-reliant ironmen/women)  Findings To address these pervasive goal and identity conflicts in professional organisations, we translate the results of a multiyear research study examining the US Army's efforts to transform its mental health support during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  We highlight parallels between providing support to frontline military units and frontline healthcare units during COVID-19 and surface implications for structuring mental health supports during a crisis  We describe how an intentional organisational design used by the US Army that assigned specific mental health personnel to frontline units helped to mitigate professional goal and identity conflicts by creating personalised relationships and contextualising mental health offerings  Conclusion Addressing frontline caregivers' mental health needs is a vital part of health delivery organisations' response to COVID-19, but without thoughtful organisational design, well-intentioned efforts may fall short  An approach that assigns individual mental health personnel to support specific frontline units may be particularly promising  ©","DiBenigno, J.; Kerrissey, M.","https://doi.org/10.1136/leader-2020-000279",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: BMJ Leader;4(3):124-127, 2020.; Publication details: BMJ Leader;4(3):124-127, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Operation and Management of Seoul Metropolitan City Community Treatment Center for Mild Condition COVID-19 Patients","BACKGROUND: In response to the disaster of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Seoul Metropolitan Government (SMG) established a patient facility for mild condition patients other than hospital. This study was conducted to investigate the operation and necessary resources of a community treatment center (CTC) operated in Seoul, a metropolitan city with a population of 10 million. METHODS: To respond COVID-19 epidemic, the SMG designated 5 municipal hospitals as dedicated COVID-19 hospitals and implemented one CTC cooperated with the Boramae Municipal Hospital for COVID-19 patients in Seoul. As a retrospective cross-sectional observational study, retrospective medical records review was conducted for patients admitted to the Seoul CTC. The admission and discharge route of CTC patients were investigated. The patient characteristics were compared according to route of discharge whether the patient was discharged to home or transferred to hospital. To report the operation of CTC, the daily mean number of tests (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and chest X-ray) and consultations by medical staffs were calculated per week. The list of frequent used medications and who used medication most frequently were investigated. RESULTS: Until May 27 when the Seoul CTC was closed, 26.5% (n = 213) of total 803 COVID-19 patients in Seoul were admitted to the CTC. It was 35.7% (n = 213) of 597 newly diagnosed patients in Seoul during the 11 weeks of operation. The median length of stay was 21 days (interquartile range, 12-29 days). A total of 191 patients (89.7%) were discharged to home after virologic remission and 22 (10.3%) were transferred to hospital for further treatment. Fifty percent of transferred patients were within a week since CTC admission. Daily 2.5-3.6 consultations by doctors or nurses and 0.4-0.9 tests were provided to one patient. The most frequently prescribed medication was symptomatic medication for COVID-19 (cough/sputum and rhinorrhea). The next ranking was psychiatric medication for sleep problem and depression/anxiety, which was prescribed more than digestive drug. CONCLUSION: In the time of an infectious disease disaster, a metropolitan city can operate a temporary patient facility such as CTC to make a surge capacity and appropriately allocate scarce medical resource.","Lee, Sun Young; Song, Kyoung Jun; Lim, Chun Soo; Kim, Byeong Gwan; Chai, Young Jun; Lee, Jung Kyu; Kim, Su Hwan; Lim, Hyouk Jae","https://dx.doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e367",NA,"Country: KR; CORÉIA DO SUL; SOUTH KOREA; COREA DEL SUR; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Korean Med Sci;35(40): e367, 2020 Oct 19.; Publication details: J Korean Med Sci;35(40): e367, 2020 Oct 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Case reports of first psychiatric presentations during CoViD-19 pandemic","CoViD-19 pandemic has created a global concern in the whole population. The psychiatric and social impact of the viral infection is recorded differently by the community. However, more vulnerable individuals with negative psychiatric history are presenting to mental health hospitals for admission, assessment and treatment due to abnormal reactions to CoViD-19 pandemic. The current study reports six clinical cases of first psychiatric presentation that were characterised by sudden onset of symptoms, manic and psychotic symptoms, adverse response to stress, psychomotor agitation and behaviours out of character. The presentation was short-lived and responded to typical antipsychotics and antidepressants. The posed diagnoses were acute and transient psychotic disorder and acute stress reaction.","Lazzari, Carlo; Nusair, Abdul; Shoka, Ahmed; Hein, Su Mon; Rabottini, Marco","https://dx.doi.org/10.1708/3457.34465",NA,"Country: IT; ITÁLIA; ITALY; ITALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Riv Psichiatr;55(5): 319-321, 2020.; Publication details: Riv Psichiatr;55(5): 319-321, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Trauma collettivo ed esperienza di incertezza: un confronto tra il terremoto del 2012 e la pandemia del 2020 in Italia; [Collective trauma and experience of uncertainty: a comparison between the 2012 earthquake and the 2020 pandemic in Italy]","The situation of uncertainty several people faced in Italy due to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic suggested this contribution concerning the potential outcomes in some safety areas of the primary needs of the individual: safety and security needs, love and belonging needs, esteem, and self-actualization. When uncertainty features one or more of them, the risk of health outcomes increases, specifically with respect to mental health. This contribution compares the experience of the severe earthquake that hit Emilia-Romagna region (North Italy) in May 2012 and the epidemic of CoViD-19 officially started in Italy in February 2020. Both experiences were lived by the authors, as citizens and mental health professionals. The considerations presented stemmed out from the clinical experience and are articulated around some key words: surprise, length, places, society, work, welfare, feelings, economics. Similarities and differences are presented, suggesting that new therapeutic devices are necessary, to hold and treat patients during this specific epidemic, as well as during future ones.

"Mental Health Presentations to Christchurch Hospital Emergency Department During COVID-19 Lockdown","OBJECTIVE: To describe mental health presentations to a tertiary emergency department in New Zealand during a national COVID-19 Lockdown. METHOD: A retrospective, comparative cohort study in Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand. RESULTS: There was a 3510 patient (37%) decrease in all presentations to Christchurch Emergency Department during the five week COVID-19 lockdown period from 26/03/2020 to 28/03/2020, compared to a 111 patient (1.2%) decrease in the same time period in the previous year (p < 0.00001). There is usually a seasonal reduction in mental health attendances at this time of year compared to the weeks before. In 2019 there was a 49 patient (9.8%) reduction in mental health presentations, while in 2020 there was a 193 patient (34%) reduction (p < 0.001). In 2020 the proportion of mental health attendances compared to all ED attendances during the five week lockdown period was similar to the five week pre-lockdown period (564/9460 vs. 371/5950, p = 0.48). The proportion of mental health patients presenting due to overdose increased by 6.5% (158/564 vs. 128/371, p = 0.035); those due to self-harm increased by 3.5% (35/564 vs. 36/371, p = 0.049). The proportion of mental health presentations due to anxiety, depression and other non-self-harm/overdose complaints decreased by 10% (371/564 vs. 207/371, p = 0.002). The proportion of overdoses of paracetamol and ibuprofen increased by 13.4% during lockdown (22/158 vs. 35/128, p = 0.005). CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 lockdown, both overall emergency department presentations as well as mental health-related presentations decreased. There was a relative increase in overdoses and self harm, particularly involving paracetamol and ibuprofen. This article is protected by copyright.

"Investigation of the Status of Nurses Returning to Work After Recovering From COVID-19 and Influencing Factors","BACKGROUND: More than 3000 medical personnel in China had been infected with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). We report on 75 previously infected nurses who returned to work. PURPOSE: The aim was to understand the adaptation status of nurses after recovering from COVID-19 and returning to work. METHODS: Data were collected online via the Work Adaptation Scale and the Psychological Capital Scale, and the related influencing factors were analyzed. RESULTS: The social integration and task mastery scores were highest, and the clear roles and cultural adaptation scores were low. The self-efficacy and hope scores were highest, but the resilience and optimism scores were not high. Psychological capital was positively correlated with work adaptation (P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: To ensure the quality and safety of nursing care, nurse managers should adopt effective intervention measures to address the physical and mental health of returning nurses and improve their levels of psychological capital and adaptability.","Zheng, Na; Zhang, Teng; Liu, Yu; Zhu, Xiu-Qin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/NCQ.0000000000000521",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Nurs Care Qual;2020 Oct 19.; Publication details: J Nurs Care Qual;2020 Oct 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A quantitative and qualitative study on the neuropsychiatric sequelae of acutely ill COVID-19 inpatients in isolation facilities","This study examined the neuropsychiatric sequelae of acutely ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection who received treatment in hospital isolation wards during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ten COVID-19 patients who received treatment in various hospitals in Chongqing, China; 10 age- and gender-matched psychiatric patients; and 10 healthy control participants residing in the same city were recruited. All participants completed a survey that collected information on demographic data, physical symptoms in the past 14 days and psychological parameters. Face-to-face interviews with COVID-19 patients were also performed using semi-structured questions. Among the COVID-19 patients, 40% had abnormal findings on the chest computed topography scan, 20% had dysosmia, 10% had dysgeusia, and 80% had repeated positivity on COVID-19 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. COVID-19 and psychiatric patients were significantly more worried about their health than healthy controls (p = 0.019). A greater proportion of COVID-19 patients experienced impulsivity (p = 0.016) and insomnia (p = 0.039) than psychiatric patients and healthy controls. COVID-19 patients reported a higher psychological impact of the outbreak than psychiatric patients and healthy controls, with half of them having clinically significant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. COVID-19 and psychiatric patients had higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress than healthy controls. Three themes emerged from the interviews with COVID-19 patients: (i) The emotions experienced by patients after COVID-19 infection (i.e., shock, fear, despair, hope, and boredom); (ii) the external factors that affected patients' mood (i.e., discrimination, medical expenses, care by healthcare workers); and (iii) coping and self-help behavior (i.e., distraction, problem-solving and online support). The future direction in COVID-19 management involves the development of a holistic inpatient service to promote immune and psychological resilience.","Hao, Fengyi; Tam, Wilson; Hu, Xiaoyu; Tan, Wanqiu; Jiang, Li; Jiang, Xiaojiang; Zhang, Ling; Zhao, Xinling; Zou, Yiran; Hu, Yirong; Luo, Xi; McIntyre, Roger S; Quek, Travis; Tran, Bach Xuan; Zhang, Zhisong; Pham, Hai Quang; Ho, Cyrus S H; Ho, Roger C M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01039-2",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 355, 2020 Oct 19.; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 355, 2020 Oct 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychiatric Disorders and Hydroxychloroquine for Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A VigiBase Study","INTRODUCTION: In the stressful context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some reports have raised concerns regarding psychiatric disorders with the use of hydroxychloroquine. In this study, we reviewed all psychiatric adverse effects with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, as well as in other indications, reported in VigiBase, the World Health Organization's (WHO) global database of individual case safety reports. METHODS: First, we analyzed all psychiatric adverse effects, including suicide, of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients reported to 16 June 2020. We also performed disproportionality analysis to investigate the risk of reporting psychiatric disorders with hydroxychloroquine compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir prescribed in COVID-19 patients. We used reporting odds ratios (RORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to calculate disproportionality. Second, we sought to examine the psychiatric safety profile of hydroxychloroquine in other indications (before 2020). RESULTS: Among the 1754 reports with hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, we found 56 psychiatric adverse effects. Half of these adverse effects were serious, including four completed suicides, three cases of intentional self-injury, and 12 cases of psychotic disorders with hallucinations. Compared with remdesivir, tocilizumab, or lopinavir/ritonavir, the use of hydroxychloroquine was associated with an increased risk of reporting psychiatric disorders (ROR 6.27, 95% CI 2.74-14.35). Before 2020, suicide was the main cause of death among all adverse drug reactions reported with hydroxychloroquine, followed by cardiac adverse effects (cardiomyopathy) and respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: This pharmacovigilance analysis suggests that COVID-19 patients exposed to hydroxychloroquine experienced serious psychiatric disorders, and, among these patients, some committed suicide. Further real-world studies are needed to quantify the psychiatric risk associated with hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Garcia, Philippe; Revet, Alexis; Yrondi, Antoine; Rousseau, Vanessa; Degboe, Yannick; Montastruc, François","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40264-020-01013-3",NA,"Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÂNDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Drug Saf;2020 Oct 19.; Publication details: Drug Saf;2020 Oct 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The unfolding COVID-19 pandemic: A probability-based, nationally representative study of mental health in the United States","The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is a collective stressor unfolding over time; yet, rigorous empirical studies addressing its mental health consequences among large probability-based national samples are rare. Between 18 March and 18 April 2020, as illness and death escalated in the United States, we assessed acute stress, depressive symptoms, and direct, community, and media-based exposures to COVID-19 in three consecutive representative samples from the U.S. probability-based nationally representative NORC AmeriSpeak panel across three 10-day periods (total N = 6514). Acute stress and depressive symptoms increased significantly over time as COVID-19 deaths increased across the United States. Preexisting mental and physical health diagnoses, daily COVID-19-related media exposure, conflicting COVID-19 information in media, and secondary stressors were all associated with acute stress and depressive symptoms. Results have implications for targeting public health interventions and risk communication efforts to promote community resilience as the pandemic waxes and wanes over time.","Holman, E Alison; Thompson, Rebecca R; Garfin, Dana Rose; Silver, Roxane Cohen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abd5390",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sci Adv;6(42)2020 Oct.; Publication details: Sci Adv;6(42)2020 Oct.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Uncovering psychobehavioural implications of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Iran","Iran is the country in Western Asia most impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak. A survey was conducted among the general public in Iran aimed at investigating psychobehavioural issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak, namely (a) barriers to preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection; (b) negative emotions towards SARS-CoV-2 infection; and (c) anxiety levels among the general public in Iran. A cross-sectional, web-based survey using an online questionnaire was carried out between 16 March and 1 April 2020. The six-item version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) was used to assess anxiety levels. A total of 1,789 complete responses were received. Nearly 60% reported having difficulty in wearing a face mask to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for the total prevention barrier score was 35.8 (SD ± 7.1; range 18-68) out of a possible score of 72. Male respondents [odds ratio (OR) = 1.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.51] and respondents who perceived their health status as poor/fair (OR = 1.49; 95% CI 1.31-1.82) were predictors of high prevention barriers. Negative emotions such as fear (74.6%) followed by depression (43.4%) and stigma (23.0%) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported. Respondents who perceived their health as poor/fair (OR = 2.19; 95% CI 1.57-3.04) reported a higher likelihood of having higher negative emotions. Findings on anxiety level revealed 68.0% (95% CI 65.8-70.1) reported moderate to severe anxiety. Respondents who perceived their health as poor/fair (OR = 3.46; 95% CI 12.22-5.40) and who were females (OR = 1.91; 95% CI 1.55-2.36) were predictors of moderate to severe anxiety.

"Coronavirus Impacts on Midwest Row-Crop Agriculture","Impacts from the coronavirus pandemic have depressed market returns to corn and soybean farmers in the Midwest, extending pressures that have existed since 2013 and which were made worse by trade disputes with China. Without large ad hoc Federal aid, income on Midwest grain farms would have been quite low and the ongoing cash flow crunch much worse. Farmland prices have not adjusted downward, in part due to continuing ad hoc Federal aid, but also because interest rates have been historically very low. The financial (solvency) position of Midwest grain farms is surprisingly strong because of the strength in land values. However, the financial condition of Midwest row-crop agriculture could deteriorate markedly if recent and large infusions of ad hoc Federal aid dissipates or if interest rates rise sharply.","Schnitkey, Gary D; Paulson, Nicholas D; Irwin, Scott H; Coppess, Jonathan; Sherrick, Bruce J; Swanson, Krista J; Zulauf, Carl R; Hubbs, Todd","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/aepp.13095",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Appl Econ Perspect Policy;2020 Sep 24.; Publication details: Appl Econ Perspect Policy;2020 Sep 24.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Prevalence of Perceived Stress, Anxiety, Depression, and Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms in Health Care Workers and Other Workers in Alberta During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-Sectional Survey","BACKGROUND: During pandemics, effective containment and mitigation measures may also negatively influence psychological stability. As knowledge about COVID-19 rapidly evolves, global implementation of containment and mitigation measures has varied greatly, with impacts to mental wellness. Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health needs of health care workers and other workers may help mitigate mental health impacts and secure sustained delivery of health care and other essential goods and services. OBJECTIVE: This study assessed the self-reported prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms in health care workers and other workers seeking support through Text4Hope, an evidence-based SMS text messaging service supporting the mental health of residents of Alberta, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An online cross-sectional survey gathered demographic (age, gender, ethnicity, education, relationship, housing and employment status, employment type, and isolation status) and clinical characteristics using validated tools (self-reported stress, anxiety, depression, and contamination/hand hygiene obsessive-compulsive symptoms). Descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis were used to compare the clinical characteristics of health care workers and other workers. Post hoc analysis was conducted on variables with >3 response categories using adjusted residuals. Logistic regression determined associations between worker type and likelihood of self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder, while controlling for other variables. RESULTS: Overall, 8267 surveys were submitted by 44,992 Text4Hope subscribers (19.39%). Of these, 5990 respondents were employed (72.5%), 958 (11.6%) were unemployed, 454 (5.5%) were students, 559 (6.8%) were retired, 234 (2.8%) selected ""other,"" and 72 (0.9%) did not indicate their employment status. Most employed survey respondents were female (n=4621, 86.2%). In the general sample, the 6-week prevalence rates for moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 85.6%, 47.0%, and 44.0%, respectively. Self-reported symptoms of moderate or high stress, anxiety, and depression were all statistically significantly higher in other workers than in health care workers (P<.001). Other workers reported higher obsessive-compulsive symptoms (worry about contamination and compulsive handwashing behavior) after the onset of the pandemic (P<.001), while health care worker symptoms were statistically significantly higher before and during the COVID-19 pandemic (P<.001). This finding should be interpreted with caution, as it is unclear the extent to which the adaptive behavior of health care workers or the other workers might be misclassified by validated tools during a pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing symptoms of prevalent stress, anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive behavior in health care workers and other workers may enhance our understanding of COVID-19 mental health needs. Research is needed to understand more fully the relationship between worker type, outbreak phase, and mental health changes over time, as well as the utility of validated tools in health care workers and other workers during pandemics. Our findings underscore the importance of anticipating and mitigating the mental health effects of pandemics using integrated implementation strategies. Finally, we demonstrate the ease of safely and rapidly assessing mental health needs using an SMS text messaging platform during a pandemic.

"What predicts adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines? Longitudinal analyses of 51,000 UK adults","In the absence of a vaccine, governments have focused on social distancing, self-isolation, and increased hygiene procedures to reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Compliance with these measures requires voluntary cooperation from citizens. Yet, compliance is not complete, and existing studies provide limited understanding of what factors influence compliance; in particular modifiable factors. We use weekly panel data from 51,000 adults across the first three months of lockdown in the UK to identify factors that are related to compliance with COVID-19 guidelines. We find evidence that increased confidence in government to tackle the pandemic is longitudinally related to higher compliance, but little evidence that factors such as mental health and wellbeing, worries about future adversities, and social isolation and loneliness are related to changes in compliance. Our results suggest that to effectively manage the pandemic, governments should ensure that confidence is maintained, something which has not occurred in all countries.","Liam Wright; Andrew Steptoe; Daisy Fancourt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.19.20215376",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COVID Feel Good—An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus","Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability, and mood swings  Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home  In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary  Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being, and reinforcing social connectedness  The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www covidfeelgood com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflection  Three hundred sixty–degree or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction  In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion  The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships, and goals  Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures  The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano  Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention  Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment  Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions  The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness through the beneficial social effects generated by positive emotions","Riva, G.; Bernardelli, L.; Browning, M.

"Prevalence and risk factors of COVID-19 suicidal behavior in Bangladeshi population: are healthcare professionals at greater risk?","BACKGROUND: Current COVID-19 researches suggest that both general population and health-care providers (HCPs) are at risk of elevated psychological sufferings including suicidality  However, suicidality has not been addressed properly, although mental health problems are studied globally  Besides, the extreme fear of COVID-19 infection is being existed among the Bangladeshi HCPs, that is reported by a recent patients' suicide because of HCPs treatment negligence  METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional study was administered through the social media platforms  A total 3,388 respondents took part in the survey (mean age 30 1 ± 6 4 years) among them 834 were frontline HCPs (30 7 ± 5 6 years)  The measures included socio-demographics, PPE-related and patient-care related information and a question concerned with the COVID-19 suicidal behavior  RESULTS: About 6 1% of the total participants had suicidal behavior, with no detectable differences within the groups (i e , general population and HCPs)  Regression analysis showed that being female, being divorced, and having no child were emerged as independent predictors for suicidality  There was no significant association between the PPE-related or patient-care related variables and suicidal behavior of the HCPs  Majority of the participants sometimes had fear of death although no significant relation of the factor was found with suicidality  LIMITATIONS: The study can be limited because of its nature (i e , cross-sectional self-reporting online survey) and not considering non-COVID-19 related suicide risk factors etc  CONCLUSIONS: The present findings identified the substantial proportion of the HCPs and general population had COVID 19 related suicidal behavior  It can be used to advocate a large-scale suicide safety plan using a multidisciplinary approach herein","Mamun, M.

"PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AS A COMPLICATION OF COVID-19: MAY NOT NEED INTERVENTION","SESSION TITLE: Late-breaking Abstract Posters SESSION TYPE: Original Investigation Posters PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 PURPOSE: Evaluate patients with pneumomediastinum (PTM) as a complication of coronavirus 2019 (Covid-19) infection and their outcomes  METHODS: Data was obtained by retrospective analysis of a database of Covid-19 patients, admitted to two New York hospitals from March 25th to April 26th, 2020  Identified 13 patients with PTM as a complication of Covid-19  RESULTS: Median age of patients was 67 years, 7 (54%) were men, and 1 patient had pre-existing emphysema  Presenting symptoms included dyspnea (13/13, 100%), fever (10/13, 77%), and cough (9/13, 69%);none had chest pain  Median presenting SaO2/FiO2 ratio was 359  Pneumomediastinum was diagnosed on presentation in 2 patients (15%), during hospitalization but prior to invasive mechanical ventilation in 4 patients (31%), and after invasive mechanical ventilation in 7 patients (54%)  Six patients had CT scans confirming the diagnosis of PTM  Twelve of the 13 patients were initiated on mechanical ventilation at median 5 5 days  Four patients (31%) developed pneumothoraces and 1 patient required bilateral chest tube drainage  Tension pneumothorax, tension pneumopericardium, and chest wall compartment syndrome were not observed in our cohort  Pneumomediastinum self-resolved in 5 patients (38%) while on mechanical ventilation  (Fig  1) Seven out of 12 intubated patients (58%) underwent prone ventilation without worsening of PTM  One patient was discharged home, 10 patients expired, and 2 patients remain hospitalized  CONCLUSIONS: Pneumomediastinum is a known sequelae of noncompliant lungs in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), typically in the setting of positive pressure delivered with invasive mechanical ventilation  Our cohort had a low prevalence of predisposing risk factors such as emphysema, and a high mortality  Pneumomediastinum was not strongly associated with mechanical ventilation, as nearly half (6/13) of the patients developed PTM prior to intubation  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In our cohort, findings of PTM may be attributed to two main etiologies converging: damage from Covid-19 and self-inflicted increases in transpulmonary pressures  We postulate that impaired surfactant production from type II pneumocytes may predispose to atelectrauma leading to diffuse alveolar injury and risk of rupture, unlike in typical ARDS where barotrauma occurs in the context of poorly compliant lungs  Moreover, the increased work of breathing and pronounced cough seen in Covid-19 pneumonia may lead to increased transpulmonary pressures resulting in PTM  Reductions in transpulmonary pressures after intubation with initiation of sedation and neuromuscular blockade may explain the resolution of PTM in spite of invasive ventilation  Given the high mortality we observed, early identification and initiation of methods to reduce transpulmonary pressures is imperative to reduce risk of further complications  DISCLOSURES: No relevant relationships by Young Im Lee, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Nan Li, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Joseph Mathew, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Lina Miyakawa, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Paru Patrawalla, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Paru Patrawalla, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Adam Rothman, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Vishad Sheth, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by David Steiger, source=Web Response No relevant relationships by Jigna Zatakia, source=Web Response","Miyakawa, L.; Rothman, A.; Sheth, V.; Patrawalla, P.; Steiger, D.; Li, N.; Zatakia, J.; Mathew, J.; Lee, Y.

This article addresses the contents that affect the mental health of children and adolescents in the heart of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is located in the ""fourth wave of care"" in category F54 of the ICD-10 (""Behavioral and psychological factors in disorders or diseases classified elsewhere""). The presentation mechanism is: reactive-adaptive to the pandemic; triggering factor, before a previous affective-emotional instability; decompensation of a pre-existing process. The clinical features have had their initial phase, fundamentally, in confinement: somatoform disorders, behavioral disorders, emotional symptoms, reactivation of child abuse and dysfunctional grief reactions. The most prevalent symptoms are of the anxious or anxious-depressive type. The response to chronic stress, including that of low profile and intensity but maintained over time, has significant repercussions for childhood and adolescence. Few percentage that present prominent mental disorders, but we must recognize that when projected to the whole the child-adolescent population, there could be a significant number that could be subsidiary of a more specific help. The return to schooling is going to represent another important moment, the repercussions of confinement being of capital importance, especially in terms of addictive behaviors with information and communication technologies.

Results show that the majority of calls (45.7%) came from the Autonomous Community of Madrid, that women significantly used this service in a higher proportion than men (73.5%) and that the commonest age range among users was 40-59. 75.9% of consultations were related to psychological problems linked to anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, grief symptoms also stood out among the patients or relatives of the sick and deceased and, to a lesser extent, stress symptoms were prevalent in the group of professionals.

"Mental Health Disorders During the COVID-19 Outbreak in Cyprus","Cyprus has been affected by COVID-19 since March 2019. With a case fatality rate of 2.6% (until June 2020) and the social isolation measures enforced on the population, the population's mental health has been affected. We aimed to assess the mental health burden of the Cypriot population during the outbreak and to explore the potential influence factors. Using a web-based cross-sectional survey, we collected data from 216 volunteers regarding demographic data, COVID-19-related knowledge, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and major depressive symptoms. The overall prevalence of GAD and major depressive symptoms of the public were 13.89% and 8.33%, respectively. No demographic had shown any statistical significance with GAD. The younger age group of the study showed a statistically significant association with major depressive symptoms when compared to the adult population in both univariate and multivariable analyses. Our study identified a mental health burden of the Cypriot population, especially the younger age groups. As part of the preparedness for situations as the one we are experiencing and the future impact the pandemic may have on society, interventions should be focused on vulnerable groups of the population to alleviate the psychosocial effects.","Stylianou, Neophytos; Samouti, Gregoria; Samoutis, George","https://dx.doi.org/10.25122/jml-2020-0114",NA,"Country: RO; ROMÊNIA; ROMANIA; RUMANIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Life;13(3): 300-305, 2020.; Publication details: J Med Life;13(3): 300-305, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Regional differences in access to the outdoors and outdoor play of Canadian children and youth during the COVID-19 outbreak","To reduce the spread of COVID-19, public health authorities across the country have recommended that Canadians keep their distance, wash their hands, and stay home. To enforce these measures, restrictions on outdoor behaviour have been implemented, limiting access to parks and recreational outdoor spaces. New evidence shows that COVID-19 restrictions are associated with an overall lower amount of time spent in outdoor play among Canadian children and youth. This is concerning, as outdoor play is important for children's physical and mental health and helps provide them with a sense of control during times of uncertainty and stress. As policies on access to the outdoors during the COVID-19 outbreak vary by province, it is possible that policy differences have led to regional differences in changes in outdoor play among children and youth. In this commentary, we examine regional differences in outdoor play among children and youth across Canada, and the association between provincial policies related to COVID-19 and outdoor play. We argue that through the recovery process, in the event of a second wave of infections, and in preparing for future public health challenges, policy decisions should consider ways to preserve outdoor play for Canadian children and youth.","de Lannoy, Louise; Rhodes, Ryan E; Moore, Sarah A; Faulkner, Guy; Tremblay, Mark S","https://dx.doi.org/10.17269/s41997-020-00412-4",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Can J Public Health;2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Can J Public Health;2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Public Concerns and Mental Health Changes Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown in Saudi Arabia","BACKGROUND: Public measures to confine the spread of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection involves partial or full lockdown by some countries including Saudi Arabia. Social isolation, and financial insecurity are potential risk factors for mental changes. This study aimed to address public concerns, and assess mental health changes, and the factors associated with mental health burden in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia after the full lockdown is widely employed. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted between 30th of April, and 10th of May, 2020 by posting an online survey on social media platforms (WhatsApp, and Twitter) to collect data on participants' demographics, concerns and worries related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and mental health changes using a validated Arabic version of the self-rated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: A total of 1,921 responded to the questionnaire. Of them, 1,429 (74.5%) were &#8804; 45 years old, and 967 (50.3%) were males. Reported public concerns included disturbed lifestyle, getting self or family member infected, loss job or part of income, difficult access to routine health care, and 55.8% reported negative impact on their mental health. Hospital anxiety and depression scale revealed high rates of depression [717 (37.3%)], and anxiety [508 (26.4%)]. Binary logistic regression revealed that female gender, working for the private sector, smokers, and people with chronic diseases were at increased risk of mental illnesses (p < 0.05).

"Psychological Wellbeing of Vulnerable Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","BACKGROUND: A pandemic disaster has specific effects on mental health, however, little is known about those specific effects in children and adolescents. Thus, the aim of this study is to describe the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of children and adolescents and to compare the results with previous national data and other studies to determine variations. METHOD: A total of 459 children and adolescents in residential care, foster families, kinship families, or family strengthening programs under SOS Children's Villages Spain were evaluated using the SDQ to measure internalizing and externalizing problems and using KIDSCREEN-10 index to measure heath related quality of life. An independent sample t-test, one-way ANOVA and the chi-square test were used. RESULTS: The children and adolescents in this study had worse psychological wellbeing than those in the 2017 Spanish reference, that is, before the COVID-19 outbreak. Quality of life remained the same. No differences between care modalities were found. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to monitor the mental health status of children and adolescents to prevent possible problems.

The aim of this study is to examine the role of age in the early psychological responses to the pandemic in a Spanish community sample, focusing on how different generations coped with it. METHOD: An online survey was conducted during the early stages of the quarantine. Sociodemographic, health and behavioral variables were compared for five age groups. Mental health was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and psychological impacts were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). RESULTS: 3,524 participants were included (Mage = 39.24, SDage = 12.00). Participants aged between 18 and 33 years old showed more hyperactivation and evitation, were more depressed, anxious and stressed. Those aged between 26 and 33 years old showed more intrusion. Those aged between 18 and 25 years old suffered more sleep disturbances, claustrophobia and somatization and maintained worse routines. Elderly people showed better psychological responses in general. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial evidence that the negative psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic hits young people harder. These results should be taken into account when developing specific evidence-based strategies.","Justo-Alonso, Ania; García-Dantas, Ana; González-Vázquez, Ana I; Sánchez-Martín, Milagrosa; Del Río-Casanova, Lucía","https://dx.doi.org/10.7334/psicothema2020.168",NA,"Country: ES; ESPANHA; SPAIN; ESPAÑA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psicothema;32(4): 490-500, 2020 Nov.; Publication details: Psicothema;32(4): 490-500, 2020 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Cardiac Complications Attributed to Hydroxychloroquine: A systematic review of the Literature Pre-COVID-19","INTRODUCTION: Hydroxychloroquine has been used for rheumatological diseases for many decades and is considered a safe medication. With the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been an increase in reports associating cardiotoxicity with hydroxychloroquine. It is unclear if cardiotoxic profile of hydroxychloroquine is previously underreported in the literature, or a new manifestation of COVID-19 and therapeutic interventions. This manuscript evaluates the incidence of cardiotoxicity associated with hydroxychloroquine prior to onset of COVID-19. METHODS: PubMED, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched for keywords derived from MeSH terms, prior to 4/9/2020. Inclusion eligibility was based on appropriate reporting of cardiac conditions and study design. RESULTS: Sixty-nine articles were identified (58 case reports, 11 case series). Majority (84%) of patients were female, with a median age of 49.2(range 16-92) years. Fifteen of 185 patients with cardiotoxic events were in the setting of acute intentional overdose. In acute overdose, the median ingestion was 17,857 ï<U+0082>± 14,873 mg. Two of 15 patients died after acute intoxication. In patients with long-term hydroxychloroquine use (10.5 ± 8.9 years), new onset systolic heart failure occurred in 54 of 155 patients (35%) with median cumulative ingestion of 1,493,800 ± 995,517 mg. The majority of patients improved with withdrawal of hydroxychloroquine and standard therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Millions of hydroxychloroquine doses are prescribed annually. Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, cardiac complications attributed to hydroxychloroquine were uncommon. Further studies are needed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system to understand presence or absence of potential medication interactions with hydroxychloroquine in this new pathophysiological state.","Fram, Georgi; Wang, Dee Dee; Malette, Kelly; Villablanca, Pedro; Kang, Guson; So, Kent; Basir, Mir B; Khan, Arfaat; McKinnon, John E; Zervos, Marcus; O'Neill, William W","https://dx.doi.org/10.2174/1573403X16666201014144022",NA,"Country: AE; EMIRADOS ÁRABES UNIDOS; UNITED ARAB EMIRATES; EMIRATOS ARABES UNIDOS; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Cardiol Rev;2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Curr Cardiol Rev;2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Does the COVID-19 pandemic impact parents' and adolescents' well-being? An EMA-study on daily affect and parenting","Due to the COVID- 19 outbreak in the Netherlands (March 2020) and the associated social distancing measures, families were enforced to stay at home as much as possible. Adolescents and their families may be particularly affected by this enforced proximity, as adolescents strive to become more independent. Yet, whether these measures impact emotional well-being in families with adolescents has not been examined. In this ecological momentary assessment study, we investigated if the COVID-19 pandemic affected positive and negative affect of parents and adolescents and parenting behaviors (warmth and criticism). Additionally, we examined possible explanations for the hypothesized changes in affect and parenting. To do so, we compared daily reports on affect and parenting that were gathered during two periods of 14 consecutive days, once before the COVID-19 pandemic (2018-2019) and once during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel analyses showed that only parents' negative affect increased as compared to the period before the pandemic, whereas this was not the case for adolescents' negative affect, positive affect and parenting behaviors (from both the adolescent and parent perspective). In general, intolerance of uncertainty was linked to adolescents' and parents' negative affect and adolescents' positive affect. However, Intolerance of uncertainty, nor any pandemic related characteristics (i.e. living surface, income, relatives with COVID-19, hours of working at home, helping children with school and contact with COVID-19 patients at work) were linked to the increase of parents' negative affect during COVID-19. It can be concluded that on average, our sample (consisting of relatively healthy parents and adolescents) seems to deal fairly well with the circumstances. The substantial heterogeneity in the data however, also suggest that whether or not parents and adolescents experience (emotional) problems can vary from household to household. Implications for researchers, mental health care professionals and policy makers are discussed.","Janssen, Loes H C; Kullberg, Marie-Louise J; Verkuil, Bart; van Zwieten, Noa; Wever, Mirjam C M; van Houtum, Lisanne A E M; Wentholt, Wilma G M; Elzinga, Bernet M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240962",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;15(10): e0240962, 2020.; Publication details: PLoS One;15(10): e0240962, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"How pediatric resident's life has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic","Since the World Health Organization declared Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) a global pandemic, a few articles were published on the working experience of pediatric residents, especially from the most exposed countries worldwide. Pediatric residents continue to be essential pillars in managing and treating pediatric diseases and are currently fundamental health care providers for every ill patient, including children and adolescents with COVID-19. Although severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is changing everyone's life, this previously unknown disease can represent a training tool and a hard challenge for pediatric residents to improve their skills and take part in an ongoing process of knowledge.","Votto, Martina; De Filippo, Maria","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13052-020-00920-6",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ital J Pediatr;46(1): 156, 2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: Ital J Pediatr;46(1): 156, 2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Cardiology on the cutting edge: updates from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2020","The 2020 annual Congress of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) was the first ever to be held virtually. Under the spotlight of 'the cutting edge of cardiology', exciting and ground-breaking cardiovascular (CV) science was presented both in basic and clinical research. This commentary summarizes essential updates from ESC 2020-The Digital Experience. Despite the challenges that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed on the conduct of clinical trials, the ESC Congress launched the results of major studies bringing innovation to the field of general cardiology, cardiac surgery, heart failure, interventional cardiology, and atrial fibrillation. In addition to three new ESC guidelines updates, the first ESC Guidelines on Sports Cardiology and Exercise in Patients with Cardiovascular Disease were presented. As former ESC president, Professor Casadei undoubtedly pointed out the ESC Congress 2020 was a great success. During the ESC 2020 Congress, BMC Cardiovascular Disorders updated to seven journal sections including Arrhythmias and Electrophysiology, CV Surgery, Coronary Artery Disease, Epidemiology and Digital health, Hypertension and Vascular biology, Primary prevention and CV Risk, and Structural Diseases, Heart Failure, and Congenital Disorders. To conclude, an important take-home message for all CV health care professionals engaged in the COVID-19 pandemic is that we must foresee and be prepared to tackle the dramatic, long-term CV complications of COVID-19 patients.","Gallego-Colon, Enrique; Bonaventura, Aldo; Vecchié, Alessandra; Cannatà, Antonio; Fitzpatrick, Ciarán Martin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12872-020-01734-4",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Cardiovasc Disord;20(1): 448, 2020 10 19.; Publication details: BMC Cardiovasc Disord;20(1): 448, 2020 10 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A Foundational Assessment of the Effects of the Spread of COVID-19 Virus Infection and Related Activity Restrictions on Mental and Physical Health, Psychological Distress, and Suicidal Ideation in Japan","The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 has led to several subsidiary health problems for the general public. Therefore, verification of psychosomatic responses under various conditions is required. The current study examines the mental and physical responses of individuals in Japan in relation to differences in basic demographic information. A web survey was conducted among 1500 people. The results showed that differences in ethnicity, concurrence of physical or mental illness, the nature of those living in the same household (eg, high-risk individuals or preschoolers), household income, and employment status were associated with differences in physical and mental health, psychological distress, and/or suicidal ideation. Differences related to the degree of the spread of the infection in the area of residence, degree of engagement in essential work, and frequency of contact with others during normal times were not found. Future longitudinal studies and verification of the effects of multiple variables are required.","Kiuchi, Keita; Kishi, Katsumasa; Araki, Kanto","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1010539520965449",NA,"Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Asia Pac J Public Health;: 1010539520965449, 2020 Oct 17.; Publication details: Asia Pac J Public Health;: 1010539520965449, 2020 Oct 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"How to communicate with families living in complete isolation","IMPORTANCE: During the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a complete physical isolation has been worldwide introduced. The impossibility of visiting their loved ones during the hospital stay causes additional distress for families: in addition to the worries about clinical recovery, they may feel exclusion and powerlessness, anxiety, depression, mistrust in the care team and post-traumatic stress disorder. The impossibility of conducting the daily meetings with families poses a challenge for healthcare professionals. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to delineate and share consensus statements in order to enable healthcare team to provide by telephone or video calls an optimal level of communication with patient's relatives under circumstances of complete isolation. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts and Reviews of Effectiveness and the AHCPR Clinical Guidelines and Evidence Reports were explored from 1999 to 2019. Exclusion criteria were: poor or absent relevance regarding the aim of the consensus statements, studies prior to 1999, non-English language. Since the present pandemic context is completely new, unexpected and unexplored, there are not randomised controlled trials regarding clinical communication in a setting of complete isolation. Thus, a multiprofessional taskforce of physicians, nurses, psychologists and legal experts, together with some family members and former intensive care unit patients was established by four Italian national scientific societies. Using an e-Delphi methodology, general and specific questions were posed, relevant topics were argumented, until arriving to delineate position statements and practical checklist, which were set and evaluated through an evidence-based consensus procedure. FINDINGS: Ten statements and two practical checklists for phone or video calls were drafted and evaluated; they are related to who, when, why and how family members must be given clinical information under circumstances of complete isolation. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The statements and the checklists offer a structured methodology in order to ensure a good-quality communication between healthcare team and family members even in isolation, confirming that time dedicated to communication has to be intended as a time of care.","Mistraletti, Giovanni; Gristina, Giuseppe; Mascarin, Sara; Iacobone, Emanuele; Giubbilo, Ilaria; Bonfanti, Silvia; Fiocca, Federico; Fullin, Giorgio; Fuselli, Ennio; Bocci, Maria Grazia; Mazzon, Davide; Giusti, Gian Domenico; Galazzi, Alessandro; Negro, Alessandra; De Iaco, Fabio; Gandolfo, Enrico; Lamiani, Giulia; Del Negro, Silvia; Monti, Laura; Salvago, Fabrizia; Di Leo, Silvia; Gribaudi, Maria Nefeli; Piccinni, Mariassunta; Riccioni, Luigi; Giannini, Alberto; Livigni, Sergio; Maglione, Carla; Vergano, Marco; Marinangeli, Franco; Lovato, Luisa; Mezzetti, Andrea; Drigo, Elio; Vegni, Elena; Calva, Sally; Aprile, Anna; Losi, Gianfranco; Fontanella, Lucia; Calegari, Giulio; Ansaloni, Cristina; Pugliese, Francesco Rocco; Manca, Salvatore; Orsi, Luciano; Moggia, Fabrizio; Scelsi, Silvia; Corcione, Antonio; Petrini, Flavia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjspcare-2020-002633",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Support Palliat Care;2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: BMJ Support Palliat Care;2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Recovery of individual Service personnel in the COVID-19 recovery phase","To deny the SARS-CoV-2 virus easy options for sustained transmission, commanders should model adherence to, and ensure implementation of, social mitigation measures. While some measures can be achieved at the organisational level through policy, every Service person's experience of the COVID-19 pandemic will have differed, affected by a range of personal, occupational and geographical factors. A successful recovery phase for each Service personnel (SP) therefore relies on localised assessments and individualised support plans. The return of SP to the physical environment must be safe, and the financial needs of their whole family must be considered. Commanders must understand the need for balance in supporting social reconnection both personally and in the workplace. Commanders have an important role in the development of SPs' mental resilience; supporting mental well-being, early recognition of deteriorating mental health and signposting, and compassionate understanding of the needs of SP deployed or bereaved. Disruptions to healthcare service provision will impact the duration of medical downgrading, workforce capacity and operational effectiveness according to extant parameters, which must be understood by commanders. Likewise, functional fitness may have been adversely affected. Physical health and fitness recovery can be supported by time-based extensions to occupational health policy and graduated return to work physical training programmes.","Taylor, Hannah; Quantick, O; Ross, D","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjmilitary-2020-001603",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Mil Health;2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: BMJ Mil Health;2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Parenting-Related Exhaustion During the Italian COVID-19 Lockdown","OBJECTIVE: Worldwide, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has generated significant worry, uncertainty, anxiety, sadness, and loneliness. In Italy, these effects have been particularly pronounced. While research on the COVID-19 outbreak has mainly focused on the clinical features of infected patients and the psychological impact on the general population and health professionals, no investigation has yet assessed the psychological impact of the pandemic on parents. In the present research, we conducted a web-based survey of Italian parents to examine the prevalence of parenting-related exhaustion-and to identify its associated risk and protective factors-4 weeks into the lockdown. METHODS: A total of 1,226 parents provided their consent to participate in the study and completed a demographic questionnaire, information relating to particular COVID-19 experiences, and measures of emotional exhaustion, parental resilience, social connections, and psychological distress during the lockdown. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of our sample experienced significant parenting-related exhaustion, with mothers more severely affected. Multiple regression analyses showed that greater parenting-related exhaustion was predicted by psychological distress, lower parental resilience, motherhood, fewer perceived social connections, and being single, as well as having a child with special needs, having a large number of children, and having younger children. CONCLUSION: The findings add further support to the call for preventive programs to support parents throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health professionals and social workers should be warned of the effects of lockdown and social distancing on parenting and, consequently, the well-being of children.","Marchetti, Daniela; Fontanesi, Lilybeth; Mazza, Cristina; Di Giandomenico, Serena; Roma, Paolo; Verrocchio, Maria Cristina","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsaa093",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Pediatr Psychol;2020 Oct 17.; Publication details: J Pediatr Psychol;2020 Oct 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Association between opioid dose escalation and time to death in a comfort measures only population","DISCLAIMER: In an effort to expedite the publication of articles related to the COVID-19 pandemic, AJHP is posting these manuscripts online as soon as possible after acceptance. Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: Opioids are crucial to the relief of pain and dyspnea experienced by patients dying in the hospital setting; however, there are concerns about the association of opioid dosage with hastened death via opioid-induced respiratory depression, and there is little published evidence regarding the association between opioid dose escalation and time to death in the inpatient comfort measures only (CMO) population. METHODS: The medical records of adult patients admitted to 2 hospitals who had an active CMO order at the time of death and received opioid dose escalations after CMO pronouncement were assessed in a retrospective cohort study. Patients were categorized into higher and lower opioid dose escalation groups according to an institutional palliative care symptom guide. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to test the associations between dose escalation group, patient sex, opioid naivety, palliative care consultation, and opioid dosage after CMO pronouncement (independent variables) and time to death (dependent variable). RESULTS: In the 71-patient cohort, 39 patients (54.9%) were male and 32 (45.1%) were female. The mean (SD) age of patients was 67.2 (16.6) years. Higher dose escalation (n = 46, 64.8%) was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in survival time compared to lower dose escalation (n = 25, 35.2%), with a mean difference in time to death of 19.8 hours (hazard ratio [HR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94-2.97). Receipt of a palliative care consult (n = 56, 78.9%) during the final hospital visit was associated with increased survival time (mean difference, 20.1 hours; HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.16-0.63). CONCLUSION: Time to death in an inpatient CMO population was not significantly associated with the degree of opioid dose escalation.","Abraham, Dana L; Hernandez, Inmaculada; Ayers, Gina T; Pruskowski, Jennifer A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxaa367",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Health Syst Pharm;2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: Am J Health Syst Pharm;2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Impact of Infectious Disease-Related Public Health Emergencies on Suicide, Suicidal Behavior, and Suicidal Thoughts","Background: Infectious disease-related public health emergencies (epidemics) may increase suicide risk, and high-quality evidence is needed to guide an international response. Aims: We investigated the potential impacts of epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. Method: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsyArXiv, medRxiv, and bioRxiv from inception to May 13-16, 2020. Inclusion criteria: primary studies, reviews, and meta-analyses; reporting the impact of epidemics; with a primary outcome of suicide, suicidal behavior, suicidal ideation, and/or self-harm. Exclusion criteria: not concerned with suicide-related outcomes; not suitable for data extraction. PROSPERO registration: #CRD42020187013. Results: Eight primary papers were included, examining the effects of five epidemics on suicide-related outcomes. There was evidence of increased suicide rates among older adults during SARS and in the year following the epidemic (possibly motivated by social disconnectedness, fears of virus infection, and concern about burdening others) and associations between SARS/Ebola exposure and increased suicide attempts. A preprint study reported associations between COVID-19 distress and past-month suicidal ideation. Limitations: Few studies have investigated the topic; these are of relatively low methodological quality. Conclusion: Findings support an association between previous epidemics and increased risk of suicide-related outcomes. Research is needed to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on suicide outcomes.","Zortea, Tiago C; Brenna, Connor T A; Joyce, Mary; McClelland, Heather; Tippett, Marisa; Tran, Maxwell M; Arensman, Ella; Corcoran, Paul; Hatcher, Simon; Heise, Marnin J; Links, Paul; O'Connor, Rory C; Edgar, Nicole E; Cha, Yevin; Guaiana, Giuseppe; Williamson, Eileen; Sinyor, Mark; Platt, Stephen","https://dx.doi.org/10.1027/0227-5910/a000753",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Crisis;: 1-14, 2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: Crisis;: 1-14, 2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Undergraduate Neuroscience Education: Meeting the Challenges of the 21 st Century","The dedication of undergraduate neuroscience faculty to their students could not have been more evident than what these educators demonstrated when the COVID-19 pandemic impacted colleges and universities across the United States. These faculty faced the crisis head-on to provide their students with exceptional instruction in virtual formats that many faculty had never used for instruction before the pandemic. This same tenacious attitude has been reflected in pedagogical efforts that undergraduate neuroscience faculty have undertaken since the mid-1990s. The challenges of providing cutting-edge neuroscience education to undergraduates in a dynamic field have produced a series of curricular designs and approaches that capitalize on discipline-based education research. This article reviews curricular models and pedagogical strategies aimed at enhancing the educational experiences of undergraduate neuroscience students whose lived experiences and academic backgrounds reflect the richly kaleidoscopic demographics of college students in the 21st century. The future of undergraduate neuroscience education is bright as faculty and their students collaborate on their journey of discovery in neuroscience.","Ramirez, Julio J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2020.135418",NA,"Country: IE; IRLANDA; IRELAND; IRLANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Neurosci Lett;: 135418, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Neurosci Lett;: 135418, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The effect of the severity COVID-19 infection on electrocardiography","OBJECTIVE: Acute myocardial damage is detected in a significant portion of patients with coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) infection, with a reported prevalence of 7-28%. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between electrocardiographic findings and the indicators of the severity of COVID-19 detected on electrocardiography (ECG). METHODS: A total of 219 patients that were hospitalized due to COVID-19 between April 15 and May 5, 2020 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the severity of COVID-19 infection: severe (n = 95) and non-severe (n = 124). ECG findings at the time of admission were recorded for each patient. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings were retrieved from electronic medical records. RESULTS: Mean age was 65.2 ± 13.8 years in the severe group and was 57.9 ± 16.0 years in the non-severe group. ST depression (28% vs. 14%), T-wave inversion (29% vs. 16%), ST-T changes (36% vs. 21%), and the presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) (17% vs. 7%) were more frequent in the severe group compared to the non-severe group. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension (odds ratio [OR]: 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.03-5.67; p = 0.041), the severity of COVID-19 infection (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.09-2.65; p = 0.026), presence of cardiac injury (OR: 3.32, 95% CI: 1.45-7.60; p = 0.004), and d-dimer (OR: 3.60, 95% CI: 1.29-10.06; p = 0.014) were independent predictors of ST-T changes on ECG. CONCLUSION: ST depression, T-wave inversion, ST-T changes, and the presence of fQRS on admission ECG are closely associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection.","Barman, Hasan Ali; Atici, M D Adem; Alici, M D Gokhan; Sit, M D Omer; Tugrul, M D Sevil; Gungor, M D Baris; Okuyan, M D Ertugrul; Sahin, M D Irfan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2020.10.005",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Am J Emerg Med;2020 Oct 07.; Publication details: Am J Emerg Med;2020 Oct 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Colorectal Services in Covid-19 Times: Minimally Invasive Surgery and Enhanced Recovery, the Need of the Hour","The health services across the world have been deeply impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic which has resulted in diversion of resources to testing, isolating and treating COVID-19 patients. This meant cutting down resources and manpower away of various healthcare facilities and severely hampering the functioning of various cancer services across the world. It is however, important to understand, cancer itself is a life-threatening condition, and there is a need to continue running cancer care services, at least for those who needed the most. Various clinical societies have put forward guidelines and protocols to help continue surgical services during the pandemic. The role of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) was initially questioned at the start of the pandemic, however gradually increasing evidence favored MIS as it reduced hospital stay and complication. Enhanced recovery programs which have been introduced to various fields of surgery to improve outcomes and reduce hospital stay. It plays an essential role in times like this, where the optimal usage of minimal resources is essential. We embraced these methods to ensure safety of our patients and staff and at the same time provide the highest standards of care. Here we are presenting our experience of running a colorectal surgical unit during these difficult times with emphasis on promotion of minimally invasive surgery, at the epicenter of the pandemic in India.","Sukumar, Vivek; Pandey, Diwakar; Kumar, Barath Raj; Patel, Swapnil; Pawar, Tushar; Rohila, Jitender; DeSouza, Ashwin; Saklani, Avanish","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13193-020-01241-0",NA,"Country: IN; ÍNDIA; INDIA; INDIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Indian J Surg Oncol;: 1-5, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Indian J Surg Oncol;: 1-5, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The health scare of COVID-19 amidst pandemics and the immune-related pharmaceutical products spillovers in the USA","In view of the sector-wide effect of the nCOVID-19 pandemic in the USA and the probable effect on certain over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical products, the current study examined potential inflation in the pharmaceutical industry arising from the pandemic-related uncertainty. In this case, the USA's producer price indexes vis-à-vis inflation of the immune-related pharmaceutical items: multivitamin, vitamins nutrients and hematinic (V-N-H), other vitamins (other-V), antidepressant, and antidiabetic were examined alongside the uncertainties arising from the world pandemic and economic policy. Thus, the (Diebold and Yilmaz in Int J Forecast 28(1): 57-66, 2012) result implied that the world pandemic uncertainty contributed a significantly huge shock to the examined pharmaceutical compounds, thus affirming the vulnerability of certain pharmaceuticals to pandemic-related uncertainty. The total spillover increased from 34.2% (with economic policy uncertainty) to 47.6% (when pandemic uncertainty is incorporated). In specific, there are negative net spillovers from the multivitamins, other vitamins, antidiabetic, and antidepressant especially due to high pandemic and economic policy uncertainties. However, the statistical evidence implied that higher uncertainty arising from the pandemic is responsible for the severity of shock received by the indicated pharmaceutical products as against economic policy uncertainty. Thus, a relevant policy inference is posited from the result of the study.","Alola, Andrew Adewale; Olowu, Funmilayo Boluwatife","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-11195-z",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Environ Sci Pollut Res Int;2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: Environ Sci Pollut Res Int;2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"""<i>Andrà tutto bene</i>"": Associations Between Character Strengths, Psychological Distress and Self-efficacy During Covid-19 Lockdown","The Covid-19 pandemic obliged people around the world to stay home and self-isolate, with a number of negative psychological consequences. This study focuses on the protective role of character strengths in sustaining mental health and self-efficacy during lockdown. Data were collected from 944 Italian respondents (mean age = 37.24 years, SD = 14.50) by means of an online survey investigating character strengths, psychological distress and Covid-19-related self-efficacy one month after lockdown began. Using principal component analysis, four strengths factors were extracted, namely transcendence, interpersonal, openness and restraint. Regression models with second-order factors showed that transcendence strengths had a strong inverse association with psychological distress, and a positive association with self-efficacy. Regression models with single strengths identified hope, zest, prudence, love and forgiveness as the strengths most associated with distress, love and zest as the most related to self-efficacy and zest to general mental health. Openness factor and appreciation of beauty showed an unexpected direct relation with psychological distress. These results provide original evidence of the association of character strengths, and transcendence strengths in particular, with mental health and self-efficacy in a pandemic and are discussed within the field of positive psychology.","Casali, Nicole; Feraco, Tommaso; Ghisi, Marta; Meneghetti, Chiara","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10902-020-00321-w",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Happiness Stud;: 1-20, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Happiness Stud;: 1-20, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental Health and the COVID-19 Crisis: The Hopes and Concerns for Children as Schools Re-open","The COVID-19 crisis has affected everyone, especially elementary school-aged children who might be too young to fully understand the sudden changes in familiar social norms as well as the unprecedented pandemic-induced educational context. This article is based on a case study that explores the perspective of the experiences of ten parents of elementary school children in French Immersion programs from different school boards during the March-June 2020 schools' closure in Alberta. The findings show that parents had a special concern for the mental health of their children during the transition into lockdown and the ramifications of such experiences in the future as students return to school at the start of the academic year under a different climate. This includes adapting to new social norms and a certain apprehension of how school hygiene and safety measures in place will prevent a new coronavirus outbreak in schools.","Fontenelle-Tereshchuk, Daniela","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10780-020-09413-1",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Interchange (Tor : 1984);: 1-16, 2020 Oct 09.; Publication details: Interchange (Tor : 1984);: 1-16, 2020 Oct 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Women's mental health: acute impact of COVID-19 pandemic on domestic violence","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic created a situation of general distress. Although the focus has been initially more on the physical health during the pandemic, mental health concerns linked to the lockdown have quickly risen. This study aims to assess the effect of the COVID-19-related lockdown on Tunisian women's mental health and gender-based violence. An online survey was conducted, using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Facebook Bergen Addiction Scale (FBAS). We chose a female-exclusive social group on Facebook and used the snowball sampling method. A total of 751 participants originating from all the Tunisian regions completed the questionnaire. More than half of the participants (57.3%) reported extremely severe distress symptoms, as per the DASS-21. Those who had a history of mental illness and who were allegedly abused during lockdown were found to have more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Around 40% of women reported problematic social media use. Violence against women also reportedly increased significantly during the lockdown (from 4.4 to 14.8%; p < 0.001). Psychological abuse was the most frequent type of violence (96%). Women who had experienced abuse before the lockdown were at an increased risk of violence during lockdown (p < 0.001; OR = 19.34 [8.71-43.00]). To our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluates the acute impact of COVID-19 on mental health and violence against women in Tunisia, Africa, and the Arab world. It may be a sound basis for developing a more effective psychological intervention aimed at women in these regions.","Sediri, Sabrine; Zgueb, Yosra; Ouanes, Sami; Ouali, Uta; Bourgou, Soumaya; Jomli, Rabaa; Nacef, Fethi","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00737-020-01082-4",NA,"Country: AT; ÁUSTRIA; AUSTRIA; AUSTRIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Arch Womens Ment Health;2020 Oct 17.; Publication details: Arch Womens Ment Health;2020 Oct 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Suicide Prevention in the COVID-19 Era: Transforming Threat Into Opportunity","Importance: Suicide, a leading cause of death with devastating emotional and societal costs, is a generally preventable cause of death and a critical global public health issue. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic may increase the risk of population suicide through its effects on a number of well-established suicide risk factors. Observations: Prior to the pandemic, many countries were engaging in suicide prevention strategies, and although the overall global burden of suicide deaths has increased, some national efforts were beginning to see positive results. Additionally, the gap between mental health needs and services has been increasing in many nations. With the added physical and mental health, social, and economic burdens imposed by the pandemic, many populations worldwide may experience increased suicide risk. Data and recent events during the first 6 months of the pandemic reveal specific effects on suicide risk. However, increases in suicide rates are not a foregone conclusion even with the negative effects of the pandemic. In fact, emerging suicide data from several countries show no evidence of an increase in suicide during the pandemic thus far. There are actionable steps that policy makers, health care leaders, and organizational leaders can take to mitigate suicide risk during and after the pandemic. Conclusions and Relevance: COVID-19 presents a new and urgent opportunity to focus political will, federal investments, and global community on the vital imperative of suicide prevention. Suicide prevention in the COVID-19 era requires addressing not only pandemic-specific suicide risk factors, but also prepandemic risk factors. This Special Communication provides prioritized, evidence-based strategies for clinicians and health care delivery systems, along with national and local policy and educational initiatives tailored to the COVID-19 environment. If implemented to scale, these interventions could significantly mitigate the pandemic's negative effects on suicide risk.","Moutier, Christine","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.3746",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Psychiatry;2020 Oct 16.; Publication details: JAMA Psychiatry;2020 Oct 16.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Women who gave birth between March and July 2020 completed a survey on the experience of giving birth during a pandemic. 885 women were consented and participated in the study. 22.5% of women reported hypertension, 33.8% reported anxiety, 18.6% reported depression, and 1.13% reported testing positive for COVID-19. 61% of women reported inadequate support for childbirth, and 20.5% reported that they did not feel safe giving birth in the hospital. Women who tested positive for COVID-19 were more likely to be of Asian race, have a cesarean section, not have a birth partner present, and discontinue breastfeeding before 6 weeks. Pandemic related changes to maternity care practices may have impacted birthing womens perceptions of safety and support in the hospital environment and affected symptoms of stress. Healthcare policy and maternity care practices should promote feelings of safety and control and overall experience for women giving birth in the hospital during a pandemic.","Elizabeth Mollard; Amaya Wittmaack","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.15.20213504",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Suicide and Self Harm among Patients Presenting to the Emergency Department of a Teaching Hospital in Nepal","BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is a global challenge that is not just limited to the physical consequences but also a significant degree of a mental health crisis. Self-harm (SH) and suicide are its extreme effects. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence and clinical profile of suicide and SH in our ED. MethodsThis is a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the ED of a tertiary care center. Records of all fatal and nonfatal SH patients presenting to the ED during the lockdown period (March 24-June 23, 2020; Period1), matching periods in the previous year (March 24-June 23,2019; Period 2) and 3 months period prior (December 24 2019-March 23, 2020; Period 3) was included by searching the electronic medical record (EMR) system. The prevalence and the clinical profile of the patients were compared between these three periods. ResultsA total of 125 (periods 1=55, 2=38, and 3=32) suicide and SH cases were analyzed. The cases of suicide/SH had increased by 44% and 71.9% during the lockdown period in comparison to the period 2 and 3. Organophosphate poisoning was the most common mode. Females were predominant in all three periods with a mean age of 32 (95%CI: 29.3-34.7). There was a significant delay in arrival of the patients in period 1 (p-value=0.045) with increased hospital admission (p-value =0.009) and in-hospital mortality (18.2% vs 2.6 % and 3.1%) (p-value=.001). ConclusionWe found an increase in patients presenting with suicide and SH in our ED during the pandemic which is likely to reflect an increased prevalence of mental illness in the community. We hope that the result will prime all mental health care stakeholders to initiate mental health screening and intervention for the vulnerable population during this period of crisis.","Roshana Shrestha; Shisir Siwakoti; Saumya Singh; Anmol Purna Shrestha","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.20213769",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

AimThe aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on childrens and adolescents mental health in Greece. MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 1,232 Greek parents of children and adolescents aged < 18 years was conducted in March and May 2020. Parents provided information about sociodemographic characteristics, family everyday life during the lockdown and the pandemic psychological impact on their children. ResultsApproximately one-third (35.1%) of parents reported that the psychological health of their children was considerably affected. The most significant concern was social isolation. Unemployment, increased family conflicts, no opportunity for tele-work and a deteriorating psychological health of the parent, as well as childrens previous history of physical health conditions were all significantly associated with adverse mental health impact. ConclusionA considerable proportion of children and adolescents may experience adverse mental health effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdown measures, and socioeconomic inequalities may be associated with these effects.","Konstantina Magklara; Helen Lazaratou; Anastasia Barbouni; Konstantinos Poulas; Konstantinos Farsalinos; - Coronavirus Greece Research Group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20214643",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"LOCKDOWN FATIGUE AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: PREDICTIVE ROLE OF PERSONAL RESILIENCE, COPING BEHAVIOURS, AND HEALTH","BackgroundThe lockdown measures imposed by many countries since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have been useful in slowing the transmission of the disease; however, there is growing concern regarding their adverse consequences on overall health and well-being, particularly among young people. To date, most studies have focused on the mental health consequences of the lockdown measures, while studies assessing how this disease control measure influences the occurrence of fatigue are largely absent. AimThe aims of this study are two-fold: (a) to examine the levels of lockdown fatigue, and (2) to determine the role of coping behaviours, personal resilience, psychological well-being and perceived health in fatigue associated to the lockdown measure. MethodsThis is an online cross-sectional study involving 243 college students in the Central Philippines during the sixth month of the lockdown measure implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Five standardised scales were used to collect the data. ResultsOverall, college students reported moderate levels of lockdown fatigue, with a mean score of 31.54 (out of 50). Physical exhaustion or tiredness, headaches and body pain, decreased motivation and increased worry were the most pronounced manifestations of fatigue reported. Gender and college year were identified as important predictors of fatigue. Increased personal resilience and coping skills were associated with lower levels of lockdown fatigue. ConclusionCollege students experience moderate levels of fatigue during the mandatory lockdown or home confinement period. Resilient students and those who perceive higher social support experience lower levels of fatigue during the lockdown period compared to students with low resilience and social support. Lockdown fatigue may be addressed by formulating and implementing interventions to enhance personal resilience and social support among college students.","Leodoro Labrague; Cherry Ann Ballad","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.18.20213942",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Suicide Deaths during the Stay-at-Home Advisory in Massachusetts","Many believe that shelter-in-place or stay-at-home policies might cause an increase in so-called deaths of despair. While increases in psychiatric stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic are anticipated, whether suicide rates changed during stay-at-home periods has not been described. This was an observational cohort study that assembled suicide death data for persons aged 10 years or older from the Massachusetts Department of Health Registry of Vital Records and Statistics from January 2015 through May 2020. Using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and seasonal ARIMA to analyze suicide deaths in Massachusetts, we compared the observed number of suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home period (March through May, 2020) in Massachusetts to the projected number of expected deaths. To be conservative, we also accounted for the deaths still pending final cause determination The incident rate for suicide deaths in Massachusetts was 0.67 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.56-0.79) versus 0.81 per 100,000 person-month (95% CI 0.69-0.94) during the 2019 corresponding period (incident rate ratio of 0.83; 95% CI 0.66-1.03). The addition of the 57 deaths pending cause determination occurring from March through May 2020 and the 33 cases still pending determination from the 2019 corresponding period did not change these findings. The observed number of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home period did not deviate from ARIMA projected expectations using either preliminary data or an alternate scenario in which deaths pending investigation (exceeding the average remaining number of deaths still pending investigation which occurred during the corresponding 2015-2019 period) were ascribed to suicide. Decedent age and sex demographics were unchanged during the pandemic period compared to 2015-2019. The stable rates of suicide deaths during the stay-at-home advisory in Massachusetts parallel findings following ecological disasters. As the pandemic persists, uncertainty about its scope and economic impact may increase. However, our data are reassuring that an increase in suicide deaths in Massachusetts during the stay-at-home advisory period did not occur.","Jeremy Faust; Sejal B Shah; Chengan Du; Shu-Xia Li; Zhenqiu Lin; Harlan M Krumholz","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.20.20215343",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Finding the 'right' GP: a qualitative study of the experiences of people with long-COVID","BACKGROUND: An unknown proportion of people who had an apparently mild COVID-19 infection continue to suffer with persistent symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pains, headaches, cognitive impairment ('brain fog'), and fatigue. Post-acute COVID-19 ('long-COVID') seems to be a multisystem disease, sometimes occurring after a mild acute illness; people struggling with these persistent symptoms refer to themselves as 'long haulers'. AIM: To explore experiences of people with persisting symptoms following COVID-19 infection, and their views on primary care support received. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative methodology, with semi-structured interviews to explore perspectives of people with persisting symptoms following suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. Participants were recruited via social media between July-August 2020. METHOD: Interviews were conducted by telephone or video call, digitally recorded, and transcribed with consent. Thematic analysis was conducted applying constant comparison techniques. People with experience of persisting symptoms contributed to study design and data analysis. RESULTS: This article reports analysis of 24 interviews. The main themes include: the ' hard and heavy work ' of enduring and managing symptoms and accessing care; living with uncertainty, helplessness and fear, particularly over whether recovery is possible; the importance of finding the 'right' GP (understanding, empathy, and support needed); and recovery and rehabilitation: what would help? CONCLUSION: This study will raise awareness among primary care professionals, and commissioners, of long-COVID and the range of symptoms people are experiencing. Patients require their GP to believe their symptoms and to demonstrate empathy and understanding. Ongoing support by primary care professionals during recovery and rehabilitation is crucial.","Kingstone, Tom; Taylor, Anna K; O'Donnell, Catherine A; Atherton, Helen; Blane, David N; Chew-Graham, Carolyn A","https://dx.doi.org/10.3399/bjgpopen20X101143",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BJGP Open;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: BJGP Open;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Investigation of mental health among hospital workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: The rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has led to extraordinary measures taken worldwide, and has led to serious psychological disorders. Healthcare professionals face greater severity of stress burden, due both to their direct contact with patients with the virus and to the isolation dimension of this outbreak. OBJECTIVE: To examine psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders among healthcare professionals working in an emergency department and a COVID-19 clinic. DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study including healthcare professionals in the emergency department and other units serving patients with COVID-19, of a training and research hospital in Turkey. METHODS: 210 volunteers, including 105 healthcare professionals in the emergency department and 105 healthcare professionals working in other departments rendering services for COVID-19 patients, were included in this study. A sociodemographic data form and the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HAD), Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), World Health Organization Quality of Life scale (WHOQOL-BREF-TR) and Religious Orientation Scale were applied to the volunteers. RESULTS: The perceived stress levels and PSQI subscores were found to be significantly higher among the volunteers working in the emergency department than among those in other departments. The risk of development of anxiety among women was 16.6 times higher than among men. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare professionals on the frontline need systematic regular psychosocial support mechanisms. Anxiety due to fear of infecting family members can be prevented through precautions such as isolation. However, it should be remembered that loneliness and feelings of missing family members consequent to isolation may increase the risk of depression.","Araç, Songül; Dönmezdil, Süleyman","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S1516-31802020005022204",NA,"Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sao Paulo Med J;2020 Oct 09.; Publication details: Sao Paulo Med J;2020 Oct 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"ELSI-COVID-19 initiative: methodology of the telephone survey on coronavirus in the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging","The COVID-19 pandemic (caused by the SARS-CoV-2) is a public health emergency of international concern that particularly affects older people. Brazil is one of the countries most affected by the pandemic, ranking second with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths worldwide as of mid-June 2020. The ELSI-COVID-19 initiative is based on telephone interviews with participants of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), conducted on a nationally representative sample of the population aged 50 or older. This initiative aims to provide information on adherence to preventive measures (social distancing, wearing masks, and handwashing/hygiene); reasons for leaving the house, when that was the case; difficulties obtaining medications, medical diagnosis of COVID-19, and receipt of confirmatory results; use of health-care services (recent care-seeking, care-seeking location, care receipt, among other aspects); and mental health (sleep, depression, and loneliness). The first round of telephone interviews was conducted between May 26 and June 8, 2020. The second and third rounds are expected to occur within the coming months. This article presents this initiative methodology and some sociodemographic characteristics of the 6,149 participants in the survey first round, relative the Brazilian population within the same age group.","Lima-Costa, Maria Fernanda; Macinko, James; Andrade, Fabiola Bof de; Souza Júnior, Paulo Roberto Borges de; Vasconcellos, Maurício Teixeira Leite de; Oliveira, Cesar Messias de","http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020001506001; http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&nrm=iso&lng=pt&tlng=pt&pid=S0102-311X2020001506001",NA,"Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36Suppl 3(Suppl 3): e00183120, 2020.; Publication details: Cad Saude Publica;36Suppl 3(Suppl 3): e00183120, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Coronavirus infection and PARP expression dysregulate the NAD Metabolome: an actionable component of innate immunity","Poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) superfamily members covalently link either a single ADP-ribose (ADPR) or a chain of ADPR units to proteins using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) as the source of ADPR. While the well-known poly-ADP-ribosylating (PARylating) PARPs primarily function in the DNA damage response, many non-canonical mono-ADP-ribosylating (MARylating) PARPs are associated with cellular antiviral responses. We recently demonstrated robust upregulation of several PARPs following infection with Murine Hepatitis Virus (MHV), a model coronavirus. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection strikingly upregulates MARylating PARPs and induces the expression of genes encoding enzymes for salvage NAD synthesis from nicotinamide (NAM) and nicotinamide riboside (NR), while downregulating other NAD biosynthetic pathways. We show that overexpression of PARP10 is sufficient to depress cellular NAD and that the activities of the transcriptionally induced enzymes PARP7, PARP10, PARP12 and PARP14 are limited by cellular NAD and can be enhanced by pharmacological activation of NAD synthesis. We further demonstrate that infection with MHV induces a severe attack on host cell NAD+ and NADP+ Finally, we show that NAMPT activation, NAM and NR dramatically decrease the replication of an MHV virus that is sensitive to PARP activity. These data suggest that the antiviral activities of noncanonical PARP isozyme activities are limited by the availability of NAD, and that nutritional and pharmacological interventions to enhance NAD levels may boost innate immunity to coronaviruses.","Heer, Collin D; Sanderson, Daniel J; Voth, Lynden S; Alhammad, Yousef M O; Schmidt, Mark S; Trammell, Samuel A J; Perlman, Stanley; Cohen, Michael S; Fehr, Anthony R; Brenner, Charles","https://dx.doi.org/10.1074/jbc.RA120.015138",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Biol Chem;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Biol Chem;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Acute psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak among healthcare workers in China: a cross-sectional study","To study the acute psychological effects of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak among healthcare workers (HCWs) in China, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among HCWs during the early period of COVID-19 outbreak. The acute psychological effects including symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaire, and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and PTSD was estimated at 15.0%, 27.1%, and 9.8%, respectively. Having an intermediate technical title, working at the frontline, receiving insufficient training for protection, and lacking confidence in protection measures were significantly associated with increased risk for depression and anxiety. Being a nurse, having an intermediate technical title, working at the frontline, and lacking confidence in protection measures were risk factors for PTSD. Meanwhile, not worrying about infection was a protective factor for developing depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Psychological interventions should be implemented among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak to reduce acute psychological effects and prevent long-term psychological comorbidities. Meanwhile, HCWs should be well trained and well protected before their frontline exposure.","Wang, Ying; Ma, Simeng; Yang, Can; Cai, Zhongxiang; Hu, Shaohua; Zhang, Bin; Tang, Shiming; Bai, Hanping; Guo, Xin; Wu, Jiang; Du, Hui; Kang, Lijun; Tan, Huawei; Li, Ruiting; Yao, Lihua; Wang, Gaohua; Liu, Zhongchun","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-01031-w",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 348, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Transl Psychiatry;10(1): 348, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COVID-19 Pandemic and the Lived Experience of Surgical Residents, Fellows, and Early-Career Surgeons in the American College of Surgeons","BACKGROUND: To better understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected surgical trainees' and early-career surgeons' professional and personal experiences, a survey of the membership of the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Resident and Associate Society (RAS) and Young Fellows Association (YFA) was performed. STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous online survey was disseminated to members of RAS and YFA. Descriptive analyses were performed, and factors associated with depression and burnout were examined with univariate and multivariable stepwise logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the RAS/YFA membership of 21,385, there were 1,160 respondents. The majority (96%) of respondents reported the COVID-19 pandemic having a negative impact on their clinical experience, with 84% residents reporting >50% reduction in operative volume and inability to meet minimum case requirements. Respondents also reported negative impacts on personal wellness. Nearly one third reported inadequate access to personal protective equipment (PPE), and depression and burnout were pervasive (&#8805;21% of respondents reported yes to every screening symptom). On multivariable analysis, female gender (OR 1.54 for depression, OR 1.47 for burnout) and lack of wellness resources (OR 1.55 for depression, OR 1.44 for burnout) predicted depression and burnout. Access to adequate PPE was protective against burnout (OR 0.52). CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic upon the lives of resident and early-career surgeons. Actionable items from these data include mitigation of burnout and depression through increasing PPE access and provision of wellness programs, with a particular focus on high-risk groups.","Coleman, Julia R; Abdelsattar, Jad M; Glocker, Roan J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2020.09.026",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Coll Surg;2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: J Am Coll Surg;2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

METHODS: Zung's depression and anxiety assessment scales and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered by a telephone interview or a self-compilation directly on the online platform. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 239 participants (men = 124; women = 115) with a mean age of 54.4 years (SD = 12.1). Education was associated with significantly lower overall anxiety and depression scores while days of isolation and female gender were associated with the higher scores. A marked reduction of health services was observed in all patients. CONCLUSION: The lockdown registered a particular impact on people with dementia and their caregivers. Many people with dementia were deprived of care services and time of isolation had a significant negative effect on anxiety and depression in caregivers.","Carpinelli Mazzi, Michele; Iavarone, Alessandro; Musella, Caterina; De Luca, Marzia; de Vita, Dalila; Branciforte, Stefano; Coppola, Alessia; Scarpa, Rosa; Raimondo, Sabina; Sorrentino, Sara; Lualdi, Flavia; Postiglione, Alfredo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s41999-020-00413-z",NA,"Country: CH; SUÍÇA; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur Geriatr Med;2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Eur Geriatr Med;2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health of medical personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic","INTRODUCTION: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused significant changes in the everyday functioning of the general population, as well as medical workers. Medical personnel, especially those in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, could have increased levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The objective of this study was to explore the mental health status of medical personnel in Serbia during the pandemic by assessing stress levels, symptoms of anxiety, and depression. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted as an online-based survey, in the period from 8 April to 14 April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included 1678 participants, and the snowball sampling technique was used to reach healthcare professionals. The level of stress and symptoms of depression and anxiety were assessed among medical personnel in Serbia by the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), the Beck Depression Inventory IA (BDI-IA), and the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), respectively. RESULTS: A total of 1678 participants completed the survey, with a mean age of 40.38 ± 10.32 years, of which 1,315 (78.4%) were women, and 363 (21.6%) were men. Out of these, 684 (40.8%) participants were medical personnel, and 994 (59.2%) were people of other professions. Frontline medical personnel reported higher scores on all measurement tools than second-line medical personnel (e.g., mean PSS scores: 19.12 ± 5.66 versus 17.53 ± 5.71; p = .006; mean GAD-7 scores: 8.57 ± 6.26 versus 6.73 ± 5.76; p = .001; mean BDI-IA scores: 9.25 ± 8.26 versus 7.36 ± 7.28; p = .006). Binary logistic regression showed that the probability of developing more severe anxiety symptoms doubles in frontline medical personnel. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that frontline medical personnel is under an increased psychological burden during the COVID-19 pandemic, having higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than second-line medical personnel. Adequate measures should be taken to relieve this burden and preserve the mental health of frontline medical personnel.","Antonijevic, Jovana; Binic, Iva; Zikic, Olivera; Manojlovic, Snezana; Tosic-Golubovic, Suzana; Popovic, Nikola","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/brb3.1881",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Brain Behav;: e01881, 2020 Oct 17.; Publication details: Brain Behav;: e01881, 2020 Oct 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Medium-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on multiple vital organs, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health, post-hospital discharge","BackgroundThe medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on multiple organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood. MethodsFifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 comorbidity-matched controls were prospectively enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. FindingsAt 2-3 months from disease-onset, 64% of patients experienced persistent breathlessness and 55% complained of significant fatigue. On MRI, tissue signal abnormalities were seen in the lungs (60%), heart (26%), liver (10%) and kidneys (29%) of patients. COVID-19 patients also exhibited tissue changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domain relative to controls. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance (405{+/-}118m vs 517{+/-}106m in controls, p<0.0001) were significantly reduced in patients. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise tolerance correlated with serum markers of ongoing inflammation and severity of acute illness. Patients were more likely to report symptoms of moderate to severe anxiety (35% versus 10%, p=0.012) and depression (39% versus 17%, p=0.036) and a significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls. InterpretationA significant proportion of COVID-19 patients discharged from hospital experience ongoing symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, anxiety, depression and exercise limitation at 2-3 months from disease-onset. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common. In COVID-19 survivors, chronic inflammation may underlie multiorgan abnormalities and contribute to impaired quality of life.

"COVID-19-RELATED ARDS PHENOTYPES AND PROGRESSION BETWEEN THEM: A CASE REPORT","SESSION TITLE: Fellows' COVID-19 SESSION TYPE: Fellow Case Reports PRESENTED ON: October 18-21, 2020 INTRODUCTION: Since January 20th, 2020 when the first case of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in the United States [1], there have been several reports of the disease caused by the virus known as COVID19  In the recent literature there have been descriptions of two different phenotypes of the virus presentation among hospitalized patients and particularly those requiring mechanical ventilation  These phenotypes, known as “L type” and “H type”, report what appear to be two distinct presentations with drastically different management which a patient can transition between [2]  We present a case of a patient with confirmed COVID19 who progressed through both phenotypes during his treatment consistent with these theorized phenotypes  CASE PRESENTATION: A 40 year old male presented to the hospital with shortness of breath and cough  Medical and social history was unremarkable  Workup initially showed patchy bilateral infiltrates, negative procalcitonin, fever of 103, and sats of 93% on 4L  The patient’s respiratory status quickly degraded and he required mechanical ventilation  He tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via PCR  Initially the patient had subpleural ground glass opacities and low peep requirements before stress index became &gt;1  He developed dyssynchrony and required more peep causing higher pressure with worse compliance  Standard supportive care for ARDS was followed  After several days the peak and plateau pressures continued to be elevated  The patient was started on nitric oxide and flolan with paralytics  He returned to a high compliance state and was ultimately extubated and discharged  DISCUSSION: There are two phenotypes with COVID-19 ARDS  The first, L-type, has high compliance, low V/Q ratio, and low lung recruitability  It has been theorized that viral infection leads to interstitial edema with vasoplegia accounting for the severe hypoxemia  This leads to increased minute volume and a more negative intrathoracic pressure with little dyspnea  The increased negative intrathoracic pressure and high tidal volumes likely lead to edema due to inflammation and increased lung permeability  This leads to dependent atelectasis and increased work of breathing  It is unclear if this is from the virus itself versus and/or high-stress ventilation  The second, H-type, has decreased compliance and high recruitability  One of the crucial things to prevent progression from L to H type is controlling work of breathing  In community hospital settings this is hard to monitor  The patient's dyssynchrony caused a significantly negative intrathoracic pressure and resulted in a form of patient-self inflicted lung injury that caused the transition from L to H phenotype  Once this was controlled with paralytics, the patient returned to L-type and recovered  CONCLUSIONS: Control of the work of breathing in a patient with COVID-19 ARDS is critical in preventing progression between L and H phenotypes  Reference #1: 1  Holshue LH, DeBolt C, Lindquist S, et al  First Case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus in the United States  N Engl J Med  2020;382:929-936  Reference #2: 2  Gattinoni DC, Caironi P, Busana M, et al  COVID-19 pneumonia: different respiratory treatment for different phenotypes?

The depression, anxiety, and stress scale - Short Form, the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, the Eating Attitudes Test, and the quality of life questionnaire were used to assess var-iables. The covariance analysis (covariable - gender) was used to compare variables among the groups. The effect size was calculated by Cohen ""d"" (ESd). The HBE group presented a better quality of life compared to both PIDC (p = 0.002, ESd = 1.26) and PIBC (p = 0.008, ESd = 1.00) groups. Anxiety (p = 0.004, ESd = 0.96), depression (p = 0.02, ESd = 0.65) and stress (p = 0.02, ESd = 0.72) were significantly higher in the PIDC group when compared to HBE group. Self-reported sleep quality was better in the HBE group than in both other groups (p < 0.05). No group presented eating disorder symptoms; however, the HBE group has shown higher scores compared to both PIBC group (p = 0.01). In conclusion, adults who had exercised at home during the COVID-19 pandemic presented better quality of life, self-reported sleep quality, and reduced anxiety, depression, and stress levels than those physically inactive ones before and during the pandemic; Este  estudo  comparou  a  qualidade  de  vida,  qualidade  subjetiva  do  sono,  atitudes  alimentares  e  aspectos  psicológicos  em  adultos  (22,93  ±  2,58  anos),  fisicamente  inativos  ou  não,  antes  e  durante  a  pandemia  do  COVID-19.  Os  participantes  foram  divididos  em:  exercícios  domiciliares  durante  o  confinamento  (grupo  EDDC, n = 34), fisicamente inativos durante (grupo FIDC, n = 28) e antes do confinamento (grupo FIAC, n = 27). A escala de depressão, ansiedade e estresse ­ versão curta, índice de qualidade do sono de Pittsburgh, teste de atitudes alimentares e o questionário de qualidade de vida foram utilizados para avaliar variáveis. A análise de covariância (covariável ­ gênero) foi utilizada para comparar os grupos. O tamanho do efeito foi calculado por Cohen ""d "" (ESd). O grupo EDDC apresentou uma melhor qualidade de vida em comparação aos grupos FIDC (p = 0,002, ESd = 1,26) e FIAC (p = 0,008, ESd = 1,00). Ansiedade (p = 0,004, ESd = 0,96), depressão (p = 0,02, ESd = 0,65) e estresse (p = 0,02, ESd = 0,72) foram significativamente maiores no  grupo  FIDC  quando  comparados  ao  EDDC.  A  qualidade  do  sono  subjetiva  foi  melhor  no  EDDC  do  que nos outros grupos (p < 0,05). Nenhum grupo apresentou sintomas de transtorno alimentar; entretanto, o grupo EDDC mostrou escores maiores em comparação ao FIAC (p = 0,01). Em conclusão, adultos que se exercitaram em casa durante a pandemia do COVID-19 apresentaram melhor qualidade de vida, qualidade subjetiva de sono e níveis reduzidos de ansiedade, depressão e estresse do que aqueles fisicamente inativos","Solon Júnior, Luiz José Frota; Fortes, Leonardo de Sousa; Barbosa, Bruno Teixeira; Feitosa Júnior, José Valdir Alves; Ribeiro, Carlos Henrique Tomaz; Silva Neto, Luiz Vieira","https://rbafs.org.br/RBAFS/article/view/14336/11036; http://fi-admin.bvsalud.org/document/view/4esjm",NA,"Country: BR; BRASIL; BRAZIL; BRASIL; BRESIL; BRASILE; Database: LILACS; Publication details: Rev. bras. ativ. fís. saúde;25: 1-7, set. 2020.; Publication details: Rev. bras. ativ. fís. saúde;25: 1-7, set. 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Methods A structured questionnaire was used to conduct a questionnaire survey of the research subjects through an online platform. The public mental health status was assessed using the Symptom Checklist (SCL-90). Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze related influencing factors. Results The survey included 1 078 eligible questionnaires, of which 252 (23.38%) were positive on the SCL-90 scale. For each SCL-90 factor, the highest positive rate was anxiety (41.28%), followed by horror (35.16%), and depression (33.21%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that from Hubei (OR=1.64, P=0.014), male (OR=1.37, P=0.036), medical related occupations or professions (OR=1.57, P=0.008), and high concern over the epidemic (OR=2.19, P=0.013) and known people with suspected or confirmed cases (OR=2.75, P<0.001) were risk factors influencing public mental health. Conclusion The mental health problems of the population during the epidemic of COVID-19 were serious, especially in Hubei. Male groups, medical workers, and people with relatives and friends who have a case need to pay attention to their own mental health. The government should increase the publicity of mental health knowledge to effectively prevent the occurrence and development of mental illness in these people.","Feifei SONG; Xin WANG; Zhiying JU; Aixiang LIU; Junjie LIU; Tao WANG","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+health+status+and+related+influencing+factors+during+the+epidemic+of+coronavirus+disease+2019(COVID-19);+<U+516C><U+5171><U+536B><U+751F><U+4E0E><U+9884><U+9632><U+533B><U+5B66>",NA,"Country: CN; CHINA; CHINA; CHINA; REPUBLIC OF CHINA; Database: WPRIM; Publication details: Journal of Public Health and Preventive Medicine;(6): 23-27, 2020.; Publication details: Journal of Public Health and Preventive Medicine;(6): 23-27, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Poor appetite and overeating reported by adults in Australia during the coronavirus-19 disease pandemic: a population-based study","OBJECTIVE: As a result of the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, Australia adopted emergency measures on 22 March 2020. This study reports the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown on appetite and overeating in Australian adults during the first month of emergency measures. DESIGN: This study reports analysis of data from the population-based, self-completed survey. The main outcome measure was an item from the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 asking: 'Over the past 2 weeks, how often have you been bothered by poor appetite or overeating?'. Data on sociodemographic factors, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the impact of COVID-19 and lockdown were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations with poor appetite or overeating. SETTING: An anonymous online survey available from 3 April to 2 May 2020. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 13 829 Australian residents aged 18 years or over. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating in the past 2 weeks was 53·6 %, with 11·6 % (95 % CI 10·6, 12·6) of the cohort reporting poor appetite or overeating nearly every day. High levels of anxiety, concern about contracting COVID-19, being in lockdown with children and reporting a severe impact of the lockdown were associated with increased odds of poor appetite or overeating. CONCLUSIONS: Given the widespread prevalence of being bothered by poor appetite or overeating, universal public health interventions to address emotion-focused or situational eating during periods of lockdown may be appropriate.","Owen, A J; Tran, T; Hammarberg, K; Kirkman, M; Fisher, Jrw","https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1368980020003833",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-7, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Public Health Nutr;: 1-7, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Refusals after prehospital administration of naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective: To determine if COVID-19 was associated with a change in patient refusals after Emergency Medical Services (EMS) administration of naloxone.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study in which the incidence of refusals after naloxone administration in a single EMS system were evaluated. The number of refusals after naloxone administration were compared across the before-pandemic interval (01/01/20 to 02/15/20) and the during-pandemic interval (03/16/20 to 04/30/20). For comparison the incidence of all other patient refusals before and during COVID-19 as well as the incidences of naloxone administration before and during COVID-19 were also reported.Results: Prior to the widespread knowledge of the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 of 164 (14.6%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. During the pandemic, 55 of 153 (35.9%) patients who received naloxone via EMS refused transport. Subjects receiving naloxone during the COVID-19 pandemic were at greater risk of refusal of transport than those receiving naloxone prior to the pandemic (RR =2.45; 95% CI 1.6-3.76). Among those who did not receive naloxone, 2067 of 6956 (29.7%) patients were not transported prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2483 of 6016 (41.3%) were not transported during the pandemic. Subjects who did not receive naloxone with EMS were at greater risk of refusal of transport during the COVID-19 pandemic than prior to it (RR =1.39; 95% CI 1.32-1.46).Conclusion: In this single EMS system, more than a two-fold increase in the rate of refusal after non-fatal opioid overdose was observed following the COVID-19 outbreak.","Glenn, Melody J; Rice, Amber D; Primeau, Keith; Hollen, Adrienne; Jado, Isrealia; Hannan, Philipp; McDonough, Sharon; Arcaris, Brittany; Spaite, Daniel W; Gaither, Joshua B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2020.1834656",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Prehosp Emerg Care;: 1-15, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: Prehosp Emerg Care;: 1-15, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Synergy of pandemics-social isolation is associated with worsened Parkinson severity and quality of life","Social isolation and its deleterious effects on health increases with age in the general population. People with Parkinson's Disease (PWP) are no exception. Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality. Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness. There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19. The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing. Proactive use of virtual modalities for support groups and social prescribing should be explored.","Subramanian, Indu; Farahnik, Joshua; Mischley, Laurie K","https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41531-020-00128-9",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: NPJ Parkinsons Dis;6: 28, 2020.; Publication details: NPJ Parkinsons Dis;6: 28, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Estimating COVID-19 prevalence and infection control practices among US dentists","BACKGROUND: Understanding the risks associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission during oral health care delivery and assessing mitigation strategies for dental offices are critical to improving patient safety and access to oral health care. METHODS: The authors invited licensed US dentists practicing primarily in private practice or public health to participate in a web-based survey in June 2020. Dentists from every US state (n = 2,195) answered questions about COVID-19-associated symptoms, SARS-CoV-2 infection, mental and physical health conditions, and infection control procedures used in their primary dental practices. RESULTS: Most of the dentists (82.2%) were asymptomatic for 1 month before administration of the survey; 16.6% reported being tested for SARS-CoV-2; and 3.7%, 2.7%, and 0% tested positive via respiratory, blood, and salivary samples, respectively. Among those not tested, 0.3% received a probable COVID-19 diagnosis from a physician. In all, 20 of the 2,195 respondents had been infected with SARS-CoV-2; weighted according to age and location to approximate all US dentists, 0.9% (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.5) had confirmed or probable COVID-19. Dentists reported symptoms of depression (8.6%) and anxiety (19.5%). Enhanced infection control procedures were implemented in 99.7% of dentists' primary practices, most commonly disinfection, COVID-19 screening, social distancing, and wearing face masks. Most practicing dentists (72.8%) used personal protective equipment according to interim guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 prevalence and testing positivity rates were low among practicing US dentists. This indicates that the current infection control recommendations may be sufficient to prevent infection in dental settings. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists have enhanced their infection control practices in response to COVID-19 and may benefit from greater availability of personal protective equipment.

"Coping Skills Mobile App to Support the Emotional Well-Being of Young People During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to increase anxiety and distress in young people worldwide. It is important to prioritize mental health during crisis events to mitigate the negative and often long-term effects of the crises on young people, families, and society. Mental health and well-being apps represent a scalable approach for improving psychological outcomes in young people and have potential to improve the equity of service access. OBJECTIVE: The Whitu: 7 Ways in 7 Days well-being app was recently developed by our group to address the urgent need for innovative approaches to reach young New Zealanders who are struggling to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is twofold: to evaluate the acceptability of the prototype app and to examine the effectiveness of the refined app at improving mental and emotional well-being and reducing depression, anxiety, and stress in young people in New Zealand. METHODS: A two-phase mixed methods study will be undertaken to achieve these aims. During the first phase, 20 young people aged 16-30 years (including those of Maori and Pacific ethnicity) will participate in a qualitative study to help refine the prototype app. During the second phase, 90 young people aged 16-30 years will participate in a randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the efficacy of the refined Whitu app at 4 weeks and 3 months after baseline. Outcomes will be evaluated using validated web-based questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months. RESULTS: The study received ethics approval in May 2020, and recruitment for the focus groups commenced in June 2020. Recruitment for the RCT is expected to commence in October 2020. Participants for both study phases will be recruited via social media and web-based communities. Data collection for the RCT is expected to be completed by January 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by March 2021. Linear mixed modelling will be used to determine between-group differences in psychological outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to develop culturally appropriate, scalable mental health interventions to address the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we will develop and test an evidence-based well-being app that, if effective, can be made available to all young people in New Zealand and internationally.

"The Resurgence of Cyber Racism During the COVID-19 Pandemic and its Aftereffects: Analysis of Sentiments and Emotions in Tweets","BACKGROUND: With increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19 globally, China and the World Health Organization have been blamed by some for the spread of this disease. Consequently, instances of racism and hateful acts have been reported around the world. When US President Donald Trump used the term ""Chinese Virus,"" this issue gained momentum, and ethnic Asians are now being targeted. The online situation looks similar, with increases in hateful comments and posts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to analyze the increasing instances of cyber racism during the COVID-19 pandemic, by assessing emotions and sentiments associated with tweets on Twitter. METHODS: In total, 16,000 tweets from April 11-16, 2020, were analyzed to determine their associated sentiments and emotions. Statistical analysis was carried out using R. Twitter API and the sentimentr package were used to collect tweets and then evaluate their sentiments, respectively. This research analyzed the emotions and sentiments associated with terms like ""Chinese Virus,"" ""Wuhan Virus,"" and ""Chinese Corona Virus."" RESULTS: The results suggest that the majority of the analyzed tweets were of negative sentiment and carried emotions of fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. There was a high usage of slurs and profane words. In addition, terms like ""China Lied People Died,"" ""Wuhan Health Organization,"" ""Kung Flu,"" ""China Must Pay,"" and ""CCP is Terrorist"" were frequently used in these tweets. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides insight into the rise in cyber racism seen on Twitter. Based on the findings, it can be concluded that a substantial number of users are tweeting with mostly negative sentiments toward ethnic Asians, China, and the World Health Organization.","Dubey, Akash Dutt","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/19833",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(4): e19833, 2020 10 15.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(4): e19833, 2020 10 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental Health Practitioners' Immediate Practical Response During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Questionnaire Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with increased psychological distress, signaling the need for increased mental health services in the context of stay-at-home policies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to characterize how mental health practitioners have changed their practices during the pandemic. The authors hypothesize that mental health practitioners would increase tele-mental health services and that certain provider types would be better able to adapt to tele-mental health than others. METHODS: The study surveyed 903 practitioners, primarily psychologists/doctoral-level (Psych/DL) providers, social workers/master's-level (SW/ML) providers, and neuropsychologists employed in academic medical centers or private practices. Differences among providers were examined using Bonferroni-adjusted chi-square tests and one-way Bonferroni-adjusted analyses of covariance. RESULTS: The majority of the 903 mental health practitioners surveyed rapidly adjusted their practices, predominantly by shifting to tele-mental health appointments (n=729, 80.82%). Whereas 80.44% (n=625) were not using tele-mental health in December 2019, only 22.07% (n=188) were not by late March or early April 2020. Only 2.11% (n=19) reported no COVID-19-related practice adjustments. Two-thirds (596/888, 67.10%) reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns. Neuropsychologists were less likely and Psych/DL providers and SW/ML providers were more likely than expected to transition to tele-mental health (P<.001). Trainees saw fewer patients (P=.01) and worked remotely more than licensed practitioners (P=.03). Despite lower rates of information technology service access (P<.001), private practice providers reported less difficulty implementing tele-mental health than providers in other settings (P<.001). Overall, the majority (530/889, 59.62%) were interested in continuing to provide tele-mental health services in the future. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of mental health providers in this study made practice adjustments in response to COVID-19, predominantly by rapidly transitioning to tele-mental health services. Although the majority reported providing additional therapeutic services specifically to treat COVID-19-related concerns, only a small subset endorsed offering such services to medical providers. This has implications for future practical directions, as frontline workers may begin to seek mental health treatment related to the pandemic. Despite differences in tele-mental health uptake based on provider characteristics, the majority were interested in continuing to provide such services in the future. This may help to expand clinical services to those in need via tele-mental health beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Reilly, Shannon E; Zane, Katherine L; McCuddy, William T; Soulliard, Zachary A; Scarisbrick, David M; Miller, Liv E; Mahoney Iii, James J","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21237",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(9): e21237, 2020 Oct 01.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(9): e21237, 2020 Oct 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Integration of Online Treatment Into the ""New Normal"" in Mental Health Care in Post-COVID-19 Times: Exploratory Qualitative Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated an immediate and large-scale uptake of online treatment for mental health care. However, there is uncertainty about what the ""new normal"" in mental health care will be like in post-COVID-19 times. To what extent will the experiences gained during the pandemic influence a sustainable adoption and implementation of online mental health care treatment in the future? OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we aim to formulate expectations with regard to the sustainability of online mental health care after COVID-19. METHODS: In an interview study, 11 mental health care professionals were asked about their experiences and expectations for the future. Participants were recruited from a mental health care organization in the Netherlands. The interviews took place between April 7-30, 2020, at the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in the Netherlands. The data were analyzed using a thematic coding method. RESULTS: From the interviews, we learn that the new normal in mental health care will most likely consist of more blended treatments. Due to skill enhancement and (unexpected) positive experiences with online treatment, an increase in adoption is likely to take place. However, not all experiences promise a successful and sustainable upscaling of online treatment in the future. Mental health care professionals are learning that not all clients are able to benefit from this type of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Sustainable upscaling of online mental health care requires customized solutions, investments in technology, and flexibility of mental health care providers. Online treatment could work for those who are open to it, but many factors influence whether it will work in specific situations. There is work to be done before online treatment is inherently part of mental health care.","Bierbooms, Joyce J P A; van Haaren, Monique; IJsselsteijn, Wijnand A; de Kort, Yvonne A W; Feijt, Milou; Bongers, Inge M B","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21344",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e21344, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: JMIR Form Res;4(10): e21344, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Among University Students: Prospective Cohort Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with common mental health problems. However, evidence for the association between fear of COVID-19 and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine if fear of negative events affects Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in the context of a COVID-19-fear-invoking environment. METHODS: All participants were medical university students and voluntarily completed three surveys via smartphone or computer. Survey 1 was conducted on February 8, 2020, following a 2-week-long quarantine period without classes; survey 2 was conducted on March 25, 2020, when participants had been taking online courses for 2 weeks; and survey 3 was conducted on April 28, 2020, when no new cases had been reported for 2 weeks. The surveys comprised the Y-BOCS and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS); additional items included questions on demographics (age, gender, only child vs siblings, enrollment year, major), knowledge of COVID-19, and level of fear pertaining to COVID-19. RESULTS: In survey 1, 11.3% of participants (1519/13,478) scored &#8805;16 on the Y-BOCS (defined as possible OCD). In surveys 2 and 3, 3.6% (305/8162) and 3.5% (305/8511) of participants had scores indicative of possible OCD, respectively. The Y-BOCS score, anxiety level, quarantine level, and intensity of fear were significantly lower at surveys 2 and 3 than at survey 1 (P<.001 for all). Compared to those with a lower Y-BOCS score (<16), participants with possible OCD expressed greater intensity of fear and had higher SAS standard scores (P<.001). The regression linear analysis indicated that intensity of fear was positively correlated to the rate of possible OCD and the average total scores for the Y-BOCS in each survey (P<.001 for all). Multiple regressions showed that those with a higher intensity of fear, a higher anxiety level, of male gender, with sibling(s), and majoring in a nonmedicine discipline had a greater chance of having a higher Y-BOCS score in all surveys. These results were redemonstrated in the 5827 participants who completed both surveys 1 and 2 and in the 4006 participants who completed all three surveys. Furthermore, in matched participants, the Y-BOCS score was negatively correlated to changes in intensity of fear (r=0.74 for survey 2, P<.001; r=0.63 for survey 3, P=.006). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that fear of COVID-19 was associated with a greater Y-BOCS score, suggesting that an environment (COVID-19 pandemic) × psychology (fear and/or anxiety) interaction might be involved in OCD and that a fear of negative events might play a role in the etiology of OCD.","Ji, Guangjun; Wei, Wenjun; Yue, Kai-Chen; Li, Heng; Shi, Li-Jing; Ma, Jian-Dong; He, Chen-Yang; Zhou, Sheng-Sheng; Zhao, Zongya; Lou, Tao; Cheng, Jie; Yang, Shi-Chang; Hu, Xian-Zhang","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21915",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21915, 2020 09 30.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(9): e21915, 2020 09 30.; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Health Surveys; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Students/psychology; Students/statistics & numerical data; Universities; Adolescent; Adult; Anxiety/epidemiology; Anxiety/psychology; Fear; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder/psychology; Pandemics; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Early indicators and risk factors associated with mental health problems during COVID-19 quarantine: Is there a relationship with the number of confirmed cases and deaths?","BACKGROUND: On March 20 2020, the Argentine Ministry of Health enforced a mandatory quarantine throughout the country in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: The object of this study is to determine the initial impact on mental health of Argentine population, by measuring the prevalence of anxiety, depression, insomnia, and self-perceived stress and by determining the associated risk factors, and to analyze that impact in relation to the number of confirmed cases and deaths. METHOD: A cross-sectional survey was conducted through a digital questionnaire, which was completed by 1,985 respondents between March 29 and April 12. The prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress and insomnia was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7), the 9-Item Patients Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), respectively. RESULTS: The 62.4% of the surveyed population reported signs of psychological distress. It was found that being a woman, being 18 to 27 years old, living with family members or a partner, smoking, and having a poor sleep quality were the significant risk factors. CONCLUSION: Despite the low number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths at that time, a strong impact on mental health indicators was revealed. The authors of this study recommend the monitoring of the population at risk over time and early interventions in order to avoid long-lasting mental health problems.","Badellino, Héctor; Gobbo, María Emilia; Torres, Eduardo; Aschieri, María Emilia","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020966020",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020966020, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020966020, 2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes; A rapid literature review to explain COVID-19 behaviours","COVID-19 spread rapidly causing widescale loss of life and economic devastation. Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesize, and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010 to April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals, and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32, 049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorized them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesized effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Kim; Jackson, Debra; Durkin, Joanne; Gyamfi, Naomi; Bhullar, Navjot","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790",NA,"Country: AU; AUSTRÁLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication details: Int J Ment Health Nurs;2020 Aug 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Ethics, pandemic and environment; looking at the future of low middle income countries","COVID-19 which started in Wuhan, China and swiftly expanded geographically worldwide, including to Low to Middle Income Countries (LMICs). This in turn raised numerous ethical concerns in preparedness, knowledge sharing, intellectual property rights, environmental health together with the serious constraints regarding readiness of health care systems in LMICs to respond to this enormous public health crisis. From the restrictions on public freedom and burgeoning socio-economic impacts to the rationing of scarce medical resources, the spread of COVID-19 is an extraordinary ethical dilemma for resource constrained nations with less developed health and research systems. In the current crisis, scientific knowledge and technology has an important role to play in effective response. Emergency preparedness is a shared responsibility of all countries with a moral obligation to support each other. This review discusses the ethical concerns regarding the national capacities and response strategies in LMICs to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the deep link between the environment and the increasing risk of pandemics.","Tanveer, Faouzia; Khalil, Ali Talha; Ali, Muhammad; Shinwari, Zabta Khan","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01296-z",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Equity Health;19(1): 182, 2020 10 15.; Publication details: Int J Equity Health;19(1): 182, 2020 10 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Debate: Remote learning during COVID-19 for children with high functioning autism spectrum disorder","The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated preference of children with autism spectrum disorder of near average to above average intelligence (high functioning autism - HFA) for remote learning. While many children with HFA excel at the academic curriculum, the majority struggle with the so-called hidden curriculum, which includes such things as social rules and societal norms. Explicit teaching of the hidden curriculum is often lacking in mainstream education classes and can be a tremendous stumbling block for children with HFA. The result is often anxiety and depression which can be exacerbated or sometimes even caused by the intense demands for sociability and flexibility required in most mainstream educational settings. Remote learning, while not a legitimate option until now, has provided these children with an opportunity to flourish at home and improve not only their grades but also their mental health. While remote learning or hybrid models may continue to be appropriate for some children, understanding of the hidden curriculum is necessary beyond the school years. Both mental health and academic proficiency will flourish to the degree we are able to make the hidden curriculum more explicit to children with HFA.","Reicher, Debra","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/camh.12425",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Oct 15.; Publication details: Child Adolesc Ment Health;2020 Oct 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Baseline well-being, perceptions of critical incidents, and openness to debriefing in community hospital emergency department clinical staff before COVID-19, a cross-sectional study","BACKGROUND: Emergency department personnel routinely bear witness to traumatic experiences and critical incidents that can affect their own well-being. Peer support through debriefing has demonstrated positive impacts on clinicians' well-being following critical incidents. This study explored community hospital emergency department staff's perceptions of critical incidents, assessed openness to debriefing and measured baseline well-being. Our analysis provides a baseline of provider well-being immediately prior to the local onset of COVID-19. The potential need for additional resources to support frontline providers during the pandemic can be evaluated. METHOD: We conducted a cross-sectional study for 4-weeks prior to the first COVID-19 case in Connecticut using a survey offered to an interprofessional group of emergency department clinical staff. The main outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Professional Quality of Life (ProQOL) scale. Pearson's chi-square test was used to identify significant differences in perceptions of critical incidents and debriefings between professional categories. One-way ANOVA and Tukey's test were used to analyze significant differences in well-being between professional categories. RESULTS: Thirty-nine clinical personnel from St. Vincent's Emergency Department responded to the survey. Events frequently selected as critical incidents were caring for critically ill children (89.7%), mass casualty events (84.6%), and death of a patient (69.2%). Critical incidents were commonly reported (81.6%) as occurring once per week. Additionally, 76.2% of participants reported wanting to discuss a critical incident with their team. Across all respondents, 45.7% scored borderline or abnormal for anxiety, 55.9% scored moderate for burnout, and 55.8% scored moderate to high for secondary traumatic stress. CONCLUSIONS: At baseline, providers reported caring for critically ill children, mass casualty events, and death of a patient as critical incidents, which typically occurred once per week. Death of a patient occurs at increased frequency during the protracted mass casualty experience of COVID-19 and threatens provider well-being. Receptiveness to post-event debriefing is high but the method is still underutilized. With nearly half of staff scoring borderline or abnormal for anxiety, burnout, and secondary traumatic stress at baseline, peer support measures should be implemented to protect frontline providers' well-being during and after the pandemic.","Cantu, Laura; Thomas, Listy","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12873-020-00372-5",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Emerg Med;20(1): 82, 2020 10 15.; Publication details: BMC Emerg Med;20(1): 82, 2020 10 15.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Drug synergy of combinatory treatment with remdesivir and the repurposed drugs fluoxetine and itraconazole effectively impairs SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro","The SARS-COV-2 pandemic and the global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) urgently calls for efficient and safe antiviral treatment strategies. A straightforward approach to speed up drug development at lower costs is drug repurposing. Here we investigated the therapeutic potential of targeting the host- SARS-CoV-2 interface via repurposing of clinically licensed drugs and evaluated their use in combinatory treatments with virus- and host-directed drugs. We tested the antiviral potential of repurposing the antifungal itraconazole and the antidepressant fluoxetine on the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in the polarized Calu-3 cell culture model and evaluated the added benefit of a combinatory use of these host-directed drugs with remdesivir, an inhibitor of viral RNA polymerase. Drug treatments were well-tolerated and potent impaired viral replication was observed with all drug treatments. Importantly, both itraconazole-remdesivir and fluoxetine-remdesivir combinations inhibited the production of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles > 90% and displayed synergistic effects in commonly used reference models for drug interaction. Itraconazole-Remdesivir and Fluoxetine-Remdesivir combinations are promising therapeutic options to control SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe progression of COVID-19.","Ursula Rescher; Sebastian Schloer; Linda Brunotte; Angeles Mecate-Zambrano; Shuyu Zheng; Jing Tang; Stephan Ludwig","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.16.342410",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-BIORXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE LEVEL OF SITUATIONAL AND PERSONAL ANXIETY OF MEDICAL WORKERS AND OTHER POPULATION GROUPS IN A PANDEMIC OF A NEW CORONAVIRUS INFECTION - COVID-19","During a pandemic, threats and risks to people's mental health are growing  However, to date, there is insufficient scientific data on the characteristics of the emotional sphere and attitude to the changing living conditions of various population groups  The data on anxiety, depressive conditions in the context of a new coronavirus infection are especially relevant for providing timely psychological assistance to medical workers, both working directly with the infected and not directly interacting with them  The paper describes and presents the results of online monitoring of the manifestations of anxiety and persistent emotional states in medical workers who are not at the forefront with Covid-19 patients and other populations in the context of the coronavirus pandemic  102 people took part in the monitoring (the average age of the subjects was 38 91±11 07 (from 23 years to 70 years), 32 men, 70 women  According to the results of the survey of four groups: medical workers who do not directly interact with patients with Covid-19 (group I, n = 55 people), who work in other areas (group II, n = 47 people), it is determined that the highest level of stress is in the groups of medical workers and residents receiving higher professional medical education (the results are statistically significant, the significance level is p = 0,01)  At the time of the examination, these subjects expressed relatively stable individual experiences of the anxiety-depressive complex  They experience anxiety, are prone to fears, and experience psycho-emotional stress  The study allows us to attribute to the risk group not only medical workers directly working with patients, but also medical workers who do not directly interact with them, and also confirms the need for timely clinical and psychological

"Grief and nonviolence in a pandemic: Precarity, mental health and other ways of living","This paper proposes a reflection about the importance of the collective experience of grieving processes, that were interrupted by the emergency of the COVID 19 Pandemic  It is based on ideas brought by intercessors who tell us about the scarcity of rituals in contemporary culture from the perspective of traditional paradigms, such as Ailton Krenak and David Kopenawa, in alliance with the principles presented by Judith Butler's perspective of aggressive nonviolence  The authors develop the hypothesis that grieving, when collectively elaborated with the offer of a safe environment of empathic and sensitive listening, where the narratives of pain and loss are welcomed, can result in a process of trauma resolution  This way, it awakens the necessary potency for composing creative and solidary actions of common care  Methodologically, the cartography is used as a process to register the lines of force and affectability that are revealed by listening processes in groups which the authors work  © 2020","de Melo Rente, M.

"Teaching During a Pandemic: A Model for Trauma-Informed Education and Administration","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) realities have demanded that educators move swiftly to adopt new ways of teaching, advising, and mentoring  We suggest the centering of a trauma-informed approach to education and academic administration during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration?s (SAMHSA) guidance on trauma-informed approaches to care  In our model for trauma-informed education and administration (M-TIEA), SAMHSA?s four key organizational assumptions are foundational, including a realization about trauma and its wide-ranging effects;a recognition of the basic signs and symptoms of trauma;a response that involves fully integrating knowledge into programs, policies, and practices;and an active process for resisting retraumatization  Since educators during the pandemic must follow new restrictions regarding how they teach, we have expanded the practice of teaching in M-TIEA to include both academic administrators? decision making about teaching, and educators? planning and implementation of teaching  In M-TIEA, SAMHSA?s six guiding principles for a trauma-informed approach are infused into these two interrelated teaching processes, and include the following: safety;trustworthiness and transparency;peer support;collaboration and mutuality;empowerment, voice, and choice;and cultural, historical, and gender issues  M-TIEA?s organizational assumptions, processes, and principles are situated within an outer context that acknowledges the potential influences of four types of intersectional traumas and stressors that may occur at multiple socioecological levels: pandemic-related trauma and stressors;other forms of individual, group, community, or mass trauma and stressors;historical trauma;and current general life stressors  This acknowledges that all trauma-informed work is dynamic and may be influenced by contextual factors","Harper, Gary W.; Neubauer, Leah C.","https://doi.org/10.1177/2373379920965596",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pedagogy in Health Promotion;: 2373379920965596, 2020.; Publication details: Pedagogy in Health Promotion;: 2373379920965596, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Update of Takotsubo Syndrome in the Era of COVID-19","Summary Takotsubo cardiomyopathy or takotsubo syndrome (TTS) has become a well-known disease not only in Japan but also in the rest of the world  Early reports suggested that TTS is a self-limiting disease with better prognosis than acute coronary syndrome  However, recent data showed that TTS is not a benign disease as compared with acute coronary syndrome  In addition to the apical ballooning, several other types of wall motion abnormalities have been classified as variants of TTS  In particular, right ventricular involvement, or biventricular TTS, is not uncommon and is associated with poor in-hospital as well as long-term outcomes  With respect to the pathophysiology, modulation (desensitization) of the beta-adrenergic receptor is suspected as a possible mechanism for transiently depressed myocardial contraction  Although specific treatments to improve prognosis of TTS are still uncertain, observational data suggest favorable impact of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers  Finally, in the era of COVID-19, we should pay attention to a variety of cardiovascular conditions related to COVID-19  TTS is one of these conditions that can be triggered by both emotional and physical impact of the COVID-19 pandemic","Okura, Hiroyuki","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjcc.2020.10.004",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Cardiology;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Cardiology;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"VULNERABILITY OF THE POPULATION OF MOSCOW DISTRICTS TO NATURAL HAZARDS","The frequency of natural hazards, such as heat waves, epidemics, floods, hurricanes etc  tends to increase both in Russia and abroad  Under the climate change, population aging and accelerating mobi lity, increased urban density and environment degradation the residents of large cities are becoming more vulnerable to the consequences of such events  According to experts, more than 11 thousand people be came victims of 2010 extreme summer temperatures in Moscow  The effects of the coronavirus epidemic are y et to be assessed, and it is important to study the socio-economic differences of Moscow districts in t he context of crisis and expanding pandemic, considering the negative consequences for health and life of residents  The authors propose a natural hazard vulnerability index for Moscow districts  The index accounts for the proportion of the most susceptible part of the population, as well as the possibility of ada ptation of residents  Such social strata as pensioners, disabled persons, residents of poorer areas and migr ants are the most vulnerable, i e  incapable of self-protection or leaving a disaster area because of physica l or financial restrictions  It was found that since 2010 the vulnerability of population has increased i n 104 of 125 Moscow districts, as a result of increasing numbers of elderly and disabled people, and decreasi ng incomes in the depressed areas  Priority territories for implementing the policy of adaptation to ha zardous events are in Zelenograd (Matushkino, Savelki, Staroe Kryukovo, Kryukovo, Silino), in the southeast (Nekrasovka, Veshnyaki) and the northeast (Northern Izmailovo, Metrogorodok, Golyanovo) parts of the capital  The adaptability in central districts, subjected to gentrification, is increasing due to th e growing proportion of wealthy citizens  As a result of the 2020 crisis, associated with the pandemic and the fall in oil prices, a decrease in household incomes could further aggravate the vulnerability of residents of the majority of Moscow districts;the most negative consequences are expected in more vulnerable areas  The results allow m ore precise application of natural hazards monitoring, warning and adaptation tools  For example, the ab ove- mentioned vulnerable areas are in need of providing the timely ambulance access and raising awarenes s of the elderly locals and migrants  <U+0412> <U+0420><U+043E><U+0441><U+0441><U+0438><U+0438> <U+0438> <U+0437><U+0430>

"Psychological Resilience of Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic as a public health issue has spread to the rest of the world. Although the wellbeing and emotional resilience of healthcare professionals are key components of continuing healthcare services during the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have been observed in this period to experience serious psychological problems and to be at risk in terms of mental health. Therefore, this study aims to probe psychological resilience of healthcare workers. The findings of this study showed that in order to raise psychological resilience of healthcare professionals working during the COVID-19 pandemic their quality of sleep, positive emotions and life satisfaction need to be enhanced. Psychological resilience levels of healthcare workers in their later years were found to be higher. Doctors constitute the group with the lowest levels of psychological resilience among healthcare workers. The current study is considered to have contributed to the literature in this regard. Primary needs such as sleep which are determinants of quality of life, life satisfaction and psychological resilience should be met.","Bozdag, Faruk; Ergün, Naif","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0033294120965477",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Rep;: 33294120965477, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Psychol Rep;: 33294120965477, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Alcohol use in Australia during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic: Initial results from the COLLATE project","AIM: The effects of social isolation measures used to control the spread of COVID-19 are negatively impacting the mental health of many. One of the consequences of exposure to disasters/pandemics is an increase in alcohol use. The current study aimed to examine what predisposing (distal) and pandemic-related (proximal) factors were associated with increased drinking in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: On 1 April 2020, 5158 Australians completed a survey from the COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy (COLLATE) project, a nationwide study aimed at tracking key mental health concerns. Using logistic regression, distal (demographics and previous drinking behaviors) and proximal (employment, lifestyle factors, and mood) factors were assessed for their association with increased drinking since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Distal factors, including heavier drinking pre-pandemic, middle age, and average or higher income, and proximal factors, including job loss, eating more, changes to sleep as well as stress and depression, were all associated with increased drinking in the COVID-19 pandemic environment. Female sex and self-reported history of mental illness became nonsignificant after proximal measures were added to the model. Living alone, exercise, anxiety, and status as an essential or health-care worker were not associated with increased drinking. CONCLUSION: These results provide guidance as to who might be targeted to receive support based on predisposing demographic factors and pre-pandemic drinking behavior. Second, they indicate what behaviors/factors accompany increased alcohol use and provide targets for psychosocial and psychoeducational supports to address these proximal factors.","Neill, Erica; Meyer, Denny; Toh, Wei Lin; van Rheenen, Tamsyn Elizabeth; Phillipou, Andrea; Tan, Eric Josiah; Rossell, Susan Lee","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pcn.13099",NA,"Country: AU; AUSTRÁLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychiatry Clin Neurosci;2020 Jun 29.; Publication details: Psychiatry Clin Neurosci;2020 Jun 29.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Social Media Exposure and College Students' Mental Health During the Outbreak of COVID-19: The Mediating Role of Rumination and the Moderating Role of Mindfulness","In response to reports of people experiencing varying levels of anxiety and depression during the outbreak of COVID-19, researchers have argued that exposure to related information on social media is a salient contributing factor. Based on the integrated model of ruminative response style and the diathesis-stress model, it has been suggested that incorporating rumination and mindfulness may elucidate the potential mechanism underlying the aforementioned association. This study aimed to examine the mediating role of rumination and the moderating role of mindfulness in the association between social media exposure (SME) to COVID-19 information and psychological distress. The results from online questionnaire responses of 439 college students from two universities in Wuhan, Hubei Province, showed that rumination mediated the association between SME and psychological distress. Furthermore, mindfulness was revealed as a protective factor that buffered the adverse effect of SME on psychological distress through rumination. These findings advance a better understanding of the formation process of psychological symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide insights regarding effective interventions for adverse mental health consequences in college students.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Fu, Xinchen; Zhen, Rui; Sheng, Xiaotian","https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0387",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Cyberpsychol Behav Soc Netw;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"EMDR in Telemental Health Counseling for Healthcare Workers Caring for COVID-19 Patients: A Pilot Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic is putting a strain on health systems around the world. Healthcare workers, on the front lines of the epidemic, are facing major and potentially traumatic stressful events, overwhelming their ability to cope and their resources. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this article will be to show how the use of the URG-EMDR protocol in a telemental health setting has proven to be feasible and effective in the treatment of a group of healthcare professionals working in nursing homes or hospital services that were highly mobilized during the acute phase of COVID-19. METHOD: 17 participants, registered nurses (N = 7) and licensed practical nurses (N = 10), were remotely treated using the URG-EMDR protocol in a single session. The assessment focused on anxiety and depressive symptoms (HAD scale) and the level of perceived disturbance (SUD). An additional evaluation of the satisfaction with the remote psychotherapy intervention was conducted. RESULTS: As the URG-EMDR protocol has already proven itself during emergency interventions, it is interesting to note that its remote use in the treatment of healthcare providers caring for COVID-19 patients allows for an improvement in the emotional state and a decrease in perceived disturbance, in a single session. This result is maintained 1 week after the intervention, despite the continued professional activities of the participants and the continuity of the event. Moreover, the remote therapy setting was judged satisfactory by the patients, even if it required adjustments and certain recommendations for practice. DISCUSSION: The remote use of the URG-EMDR protocol opens up innovative perspectives for early interventions and the prevention of the development of psychological disorders in the long term following a situation of acute stress.","Tarquinio, Cyril; Brennstuhl, Marie-Jo; Rydberg, Jenny Ann; Bassan, Fanny; Peter, Lydia; Tarquinio, Camille Louise; Auxéméry, Yann; Rotonda, Christine; Tarquinio, Pascale","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01612840.2020.1818014",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Issues Ment Health Nurs;: 1-12, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Issues Ment Health Nurs;: 1-12, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The mediation role of sleep quality in the association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health","BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. METHODS: Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; &#8805;4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; &#8805;4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. RESULTS: The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%). CONCLUSION: The association of the incidence of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors with mental health indicators is partly mediated by worsening sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine.","Werneck, André O; Silva, Danilo R; Malta, Deborah Carvalho; Lima, Margareth G; Souza-Júnior, Paulo R B; Azevedo, Luiz O; Barros, Marilisa B A; Szwarcwald, Célia L","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.021",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Sleep Med;76: 10-15, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication details: Sleep Med;76: 10-15, 2020 Sep 25.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A Possible Application of High Dose Vitamin C in the Prevention and Therapy for Coronavirus Infections","Coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses increase oxidative stress in the body leading to cellular and tissue damage. To combat this, administration of high dose vitamin C (ascorbic acid or ascorbate), in addition to the standard conventional supportive treatments, has been shown in literature as a safe and effective therapy for severe cases of respiratory viral infections. Morbidity, mortality, infectiveness, and spread of infectious diseases are dependent on the host-pathogen relationship. Given the lack of effective and safe anti-viral drugs for coronaviruses, there should be more attention in supporting host immune defense, cytoprotection, and immunoregulation. The implementation of a high dose of vitamin C therapy could dramatically reduce the need for high doses of corticosteroids, antibacterial and anti-viral drugs that may be immunosuppressive, adrenal depressive, and toxic, complicating the disease course. In order to effectively fight the novel virus, medical professionals should explore readily available pharmaceutical and nutritional therapeutic agents with proven antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and immune-supportive properties. Supplemental Vitamin C may also provide additional benefits for the prevention of viral infections, shorten the course, and lessen the complication of the disease.","Hoang, Ba X; Shaw, D Graeme; Fang, William; Han, Bo","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jgar.2020.09.025",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Glob Antimicrob Resist;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Glob Antimicrob Resist;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental well-being and association of the four factors coping structure model: A perspective of people living in lockdown during COVID-19","BACKGROUND: The physical and mental health risks of COVID-19 become higher as people are asked to stay home for an indefinite period. The objective was to investigate the link between the four-factor structure model of coping and mental health among those living in lockdown. METHODS: The sample was comprised of 100 participants. The data was collected through purposive sampling. Mental health was measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and coping strategies from the Brief Cope Inventory. A personal information questionnaire was also used to gather information about the characteristics of participants, such as age, gender and education, in addition to questions related to other stressors. Linear regression was used to assess the association between variables. A P-value < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Overall, the results showed high levels of stress, anxiety and depression among participants. These findings revealed a significant association between active avoidance and religious/denial coping strategies and mental health problems. However, problem-focused and positive coping strategies were found to be insignificant for all three mental health problems. Other social and personal factors, such as being away from family (90%), having problems sleeping (86%), worrying about the future (85%), experiencing anger (83%), lacking emotional support (79%) and having fear of receiving bad news (72%), were reported often by participants. CONCLUSION: Participants showed concern for COVID-19 that was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These findings have important implications for public health emergency preparedness planning. Moreover, psychological preparedness in the community is essential.","Agha, Sajida","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemep.2020.100605",NA,"Country: FR; FRANÇA; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Ethics Med Public Health;: 100605, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: Ethics Med Public Health;: 100605, 2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Remote Learning During COVID-19: Examining School Practices, Service Continuation, and Difficulties for Adolescents With and Without Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder","PURPOSE: This study examined remote learning practices and difficulties during initial stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic in adolescents with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Participants were 238 adolescents (132 males; 118 with ADHD) aged 15.64-17.99 years and their parents. Adolescents and parents completed questionnaires in May/June 2020 when in-person schools were closed in the U.S. RESULTS: Twenty-two percent of families incurred financial costs to support remote learning, and only 59% of school-based services received before COVID-19 continued during COVID-19 remote learning. Adolescents with ADHD had fewer routines and more remote learning difficulties than adolescents without ADHD. Parents of adolescents with ADHD had less confidence in managing remote learning and more difficulties in supporting home learning and home-school communication. Thirty-one percent of parents of adolescents with ADHD with an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or receiving academic accommodations (504 Plan) reported remote learning to be very challenging, compared with 18% of parents of adolescents with ADHD without an IEP/504 Plan, and only 4% of parents of adolescents with neither ADHD nor an IEP/504 Plan. Fewer adolescent routines, higher negative affect, and more difficulty concentrating because of COVID-19 were each associated with greater adolescent remote learning difficulties only in adolescents with ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides initial findings of the nature and impact of remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is imperative for schools and communities to provide the necessary supports to adolescents, particularly those with mental health and/or learning difficulties, and to their parents.","Becker, Stephen P; Breaux, Rosanna; Cusick, Caroline N; Dvorsky, Melissa R; Marsh, Nicholas P; Sciberras, Emma; Langberg, Joshua M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.09.002",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Adolesc Health;2020 Oct 14.; Publication details: J Adolesc Health;2020 Oct 14.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Effect of the Coronavirus (Covid-19) Pandemic on Health-Related Quality of Life in Children","Introduction: The study was conducted to examine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on health-related quality of life in children. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with 597 children aged 7-13 and their parents using the online data collection tool via social media. Socio-demographic form and Generic Health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children (Kid-KINDL) were used to collect the data. SPSS 23.0 program, descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis variance analysis were used to evaluate the data. Results: During the pandemic, 41.5% of the parents stated that their child gained weight, tendency to sleep of 34.2% and tendency to use the Internet of 69.3% increased. The average self-reported quality of life score of the children was found to be 73.91±8.44. The self-esteem sub-dimension score of the children whose tendency to sleep increased during the pandemic (p<0.05); and the physical well-being (p<0.001), emotional well-being (p<0.001), self-esteem (p<0.001), family (p<0.01), school (p<0.05) sub-dimensions and total (p<0.05) score averages of the children whose tendency to use the Internet were found to be lower. The emotional well-being, family and friends sub-dimensions as well as total average scores of the children of the parents who feel fear/anxiety about coronavirus becoming a pandemic and who stated that lockdown negatively affected their mental health were found to be lower (p<0.05). Conclusion: Although self-reported quality of life scores of children were generally good, parents reported that their children gained weight, tendency to sleep and internet use increased during the pandemic.","AdibellI, Derya; SÜmen, Adem","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105595",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;: 105595, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;: 105595, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Parenting Activities and the Transition to Home-based Education During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study reports on parent-child dynamics following COVID-19 related school closures, based on cross-sectional analyses of a survey that utilized a convenience sampling approach. Data were collected approximately five weeks after the World Health Organization declared that the Coronavirus was a pandemic. Participants (N = 405) were adults recruited throughout the U.S. This study examines data from parents (69% mothers and 31% fathers) with at least one child 0-12 years of age. The majority were White (71%) and 41% had at least a bachelor's degree. 78% of parents said they were educating their child at home due to COVID-19. Most (77.1%) reported use of online tools for at-home education, including educational apps, social media, and school-provided electronic resources. More than one-third (34.7%) of parents said their child's behavior had changed since the pandemic, including being sad, depressed, and lonely. Most parents were spending more time involved in daily caregiving of their children since COVID-19. Two out of every five parents met the PHQ-8 criteria for major depression or severe major depression (40.0%) and the GAD-7 criteria for moderate or severe anxiety (39.9%). Multivariate analyses indicated that, compared to non-depressed parents, parents who met criteria for probable major or severe depression (B = -.16, 95% CI = [-.29, -.02], p = .021) and parenting stress (B = -.37, 95% CI = [-.47, -.27], p < .001) were negatively associated with parents' perceived preparation to educate at home. Compared to parents with minimal or mild anxiety, parents with moderate or severe anxiety reported higher child anxiety scores (B = .17, 95% CI = [.06, .28], p = .002). Parenting stress was also positively associated with higher child anxiety scores (B = .40, 95% CI = [.32, .48], p < .001). Content analyses of open-ended questions indicated that school closures were a significant disruption, followed by lack of physical activity, and social isolation. Overall, study results suggested that parents' mental health may be an important factor linked to at-home education and child wellbeing during the pandemic.","Lee, Shawna J; Ward, Kaitlin P; Chang, Olivia D; Downing, Kasey M","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105585",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;: 105585, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;: 105585, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Rapid-cycle community assessment of health-related social needs of children and families during COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: To identify unmet health and social resource needs during a county-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home order and phased re-opening in Western Pennsylvania. METHODS: With public health, social service, and community partners connected through an ongoing academic-community collaborative, we developed and fielded a weekly repeated cross-sectional electronic survey assessing usage of and unmet need for health and social service resources. Using ten weeks of surveys (April 3-June 11, 2020) by Allegheny County residents, we examined variation in responses by week and by sociodemographic characteristics using chi-square tests. We shared written reports weekly and discussed emerging trends with community partners. RESULTS: Participants ranged from 229-1,001 per week. Unmet need for at least one health or health-related social need resource varied by week, ranging from 55% (95% confidence interval (CI) 50-59%) of participants in week 2 to 43% (95% CI 37-49%) of participants in week 9 (p=0.006). Increased use of at least one resource ranged from 53% (95% CI 47-58%) of participants in week 3 to 36% (95% CI 31-42%) in week 9 (p<0.001). Unmet need for food and financial assistance peaked early during the stay-at-home order, while unmet need for mental health care rose later. Unmet need for food assistance varied significantly by race and ethnicity and by household pre-pandemic income. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of families with children reported unmet health or social service needs during the first month of a county-wide COVID-19 stay-at-home order. Unmet needs varied with race, ethnicity, and income and with duration of the stay-at-home order.","Ray, Kristin N; Ettinger, Anna K; Dwarakanath, Namita; Mistry, Sejal V; Bey, Jamil; Chaves-Gnecco, Diego; Alston, Kaila A; Ripper, Lisa; Lavage, Daniel R; Landsittel, Douglas P; Miller, Elizabeth","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.acap.2020.10.004",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Acad Pediatr;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Acad Pediatr;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Italian Web Users: A Quantitative Analysis of Regional Hygiene Interest and Emotional Response","Background: Between the end of February and the beginning of June 2020, Italy was certainly one of the worst affected countries in the world by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic  During this period, Web interest in the novel coronavirus underwent a drastic surge  Objective: The aim of this study was to quantitatively analyze the impact of COVID-19 on Web searches related to hygiene-preventive measures and emotional-psychological aspects as well as to estimate the effectiveness and limits of online information during an epidemic  We looked for significant correlations between COVID-19 relative search volumes and cases per region to understand the interest of the average Italian Web user during international, national, and regional COVID-19 situations  By doing so, it will be possible to deduce the mental and physical health of the population  Methods: We used the Google Trends tool, which returns normalized values called relative search volumes (RSV), ranging from 0 to 100 according to the Web popularity of a group of queries  By comparing the RSVs in periods before and after the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Italy, we derived the impact of COVID-19 on the activity of Italian netizens towards novel coronavirus itself, specifically regarding hygiene, prevention, and psychological well-being  Furthermore, we calculated Pearson's correlations  between all these queries and COVID-19 cases for each region  We chose a p-value (p) threshold alpha= 1  Results: The general Web interest in COVID-19 in Italy waned, as did the correlation with the official number of cases per region (p&lt; 1 only until March 14)  Web interest was similarly distributed across the regions (average search volume [ASV]=92, standard deviation [SD]=6)  We found that all trends depend significantly on the number of COVID-19 cases at the national but not international or regional levels  Between February 20 and June 10, Web interest related to hygiene and prevention increased by 116% and 901%, respectively, compared to those from January 1 to February 19, 2020 (95%CIs: [115 3, 116 3], [850 3, 952 2])  Significant correlations between regional cumulative Web searches and COVID-19 cases were found between February 26 and March 7 (rho(test) =  43, 95%CI: [ 42, 44], p= 07)  During the COVID-19 pandemic until June 10, 2020, national Web searches of the generic terms ""fear"" and ""anxiety"" grew by 8% and 21%, respectively (95%CIs: [8 0, 8 2], [20 4, 20 6]), compared to those of the period of January 1, 2018 December 29, 2019  We found cyclically significant correlations between negative emotions related to the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 official data  Conclusions: Italian netizens showed a marked interest in the COVID-19 pandemic only when this became a direct national problem  Web searches have rarely been correlated with the number of cases per region;we conclude that the danger was perceived similarly in all regions  The period of maximum effectiveness of online information in relation to this type of situation is limited to three to four days from a specific key event  We suggest that all government agencies focus their Web disclosure efforts over that time  We found cyclical correlations with Web searches related to negative feelings such as anxiety, depression, fear, and stress  Therefore, to identify mental and physical health problems among the population, it suffices to observe slight variations in the trend of related Web queries","Rovetta, Alessandro; Castaldo, Lucia","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10719",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Cureus;12(9), 2020.; Publication details: Cureus;12(9), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Potential Zoonotic Origins of SARS-CoV-2 and Insights for Preventing Future Pandemics Through One Health Approach LID - e8932","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging infectious disease that has resulted in a global pandemic and is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)  Zoonotic diseases are infections that are transmitted from animals to humans  COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in bats and transmitted to humans through a possible intermediate host  Based on published research so far, pangolins are considered the most likely intermediate hosts  Further studies are needed on different wild animal species, including pangolins that are sold at the same wet market or similar wet markets before concluding pangolins as definitive intermediate hosts  SARS-CoV-2 is capable of reverse zoonosis as well  Additional research is needed to understand the pathogenicity of the virus, especially in companion animals, modes of transmission, incubation period, contagious period, and zoonotic potential  Interdisciplinary one health approach handles these mosaic issues of emerging threats by integrating professionals from multiple disciplines like human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, and social sciences  Given that the future outbreak of zoonotic diseases is inevitable, importance must be given for swift identification of the pathogen, source, and transmission methods  Countries should invest in identifying the hot spots for the origin of zoonotic diseases, enhance diagnostic capabilities, and rapid containment measures at local, regional, and national levels  The threat posed by emerging infectious diseases in modern-days also needs combined efforts internationally where a single discipline or nation cannot handle the burden alone  FAU - Konda, Muralikrishna","Konda, M.; Dodda, B.; Konala, V.

"Meaning in Life and Self-Control Buffer Stress in Times of COVID-19: Moderating and Mediating Effects With Regard to Mental Distress","Background: As evidenced by several studies, mental distress increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic  In this period, citizens were asked to exercise a high degree of self-control with regard to personal and social health behavior  At the same time, we witnessed an increase of prosocial acts and shared creative expressions, which are known to serve as sources of meaning  Meaning in life and self-control are acknowledged psychological resources  Especially in times of crisis, meaning in life has been shown to be a crucial factor for resilience and coping  However, threatening and stressful situations can also jeopardize existential security and trigger crises of meaning  The present study aimed to document levels of acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress in Germany and Austria during the lockdown and in the weeks thereafter  In order to identify potential risk factors related to demographics and living conditions, their associations with COVID-19 stress were analyzed exploratively  The primary objective of the study, however, was to investigate the buffering effect of two psychological resources—meaningfulness and self-control—with regard to the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress  Finally, a potential aggravation of mental distress due to the occurrence of crises of meaning was examined  Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted online during lockdown (survey group 1) and the subsequent weeks characterized by eased restrictions (survey group 2)  A total of N = 1,538 German-speaking participants completed a questionnaire battery including a novel measure of acute COVID-19 stress, meaningfulness and crisis of meaning (SoMe), self-control (SCS-KD), and a screening of general mental distress, measured by core symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ-4)  In a first step, associations between living conditions, demographics, and COVID-19 stress were explored  Second, a moderation and a mediation model were tested  Meaningfulness, a measure of presence of meaning in life, as well as self-control were proposed to serve as buffers in a time of crisis, thus moderating the relation between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress (double moderation)  Crisis of meaning, operationalizing an experienced lack of meaning in life, was proposed to mediate the relationship between acute COVID-19 stress and general mental distress, with an assumed moderation of the association between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning by survey group (lockdown versus eased restrictions after lockdown), and a hypothesized moderation of the link between crisis of meaning and general mental distress by self-control (dual moderated mediation)  Results: COVID-19 stress was slightly right-skewed  Scores were higher during lockdown than in the weeks thereafter  The rate of clinically significant general mental distress was high, exceeding prevalence rates from both the general population and clinical samples of the time before the pandemic  In the weeks following the lockdown (group 2), general mental distress and crisis of meaning were significantly higher than during lockdown (group 1), whereas meaningfulness and self-control were significantly lower  Demographically, age had the strongest association with COVID-19 stress, with older participants perceiving less acute stress (r = - 21)  People who were partnered or married suffered less from COVID-19 stress (<U+03B7>2 = 01)  Living alone (<U+03B7>2 = 006), living in a room versus a flat or house (<U+03B7>2 = 008), and being unemployed due to the pandemic (<U+03B7>2 = 008) were related to higher experience of COVID-19 stress  COVID-19 stress and general mental distress were strongly related (r = 53)  Both meaningfulness and self-control were negatively associated with general mental distress (r = - 40 and - 36, respectively)  They also moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When meaningfulness was high, high COVID-19 stress was related to substantially lower PHQ-4 scores than when meaningfulness was low  The s me held for self-control: High scores of self-control were associated with lower PHQ-4 scores especially when COVID-19 stress was high  Crisis of meaning mediated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and PHQ-4  There was a higher likelihood of crises of meaning occurring when COVID-19 stress was high;crisis of meaning, in turn, was associated with general mental distress  Survey group moderated the first path of this mediation, i e , the relationship between COVID-19 stress and crisis of meaning: High scores of COVID-19 stress were associated more strongly with crisis of meaning in the second survey group (after the lockdown)  Self-control moderated the second path, i e , the relationship between crisis of meaning and PHQ-4: When a crisis of meaning was present, self-control could buffer its effect on general mental distress  Conclusions: Also in the present study among German-speaking participants, general mental distress was high  Scores were higher after than during the lockdown, indicating an ongoing destabilization for a significant part of the population  People who saw a meaning in their lives and who were capable of self-control reported substantially less mental distress  Meaningfulness and self-control also served as buffers between COVID-19 stress and general mental distress: When COVID-19 stress was high, the presence of meaningfulness and self-control accounted for lower general mental distress  Moreover, people who suffered strongly from COVID-19 stress were more likely to develop a crisis of meaning which, in turn, was associated with higher general mental distress  This suggests that ongoing anxiety and depression might (also) be based on existential struggles  Again here, self-control buffered the impact of crisis of meaning on general mental health  We conclude from these findings that public health policies can support citizens in coping with large-scale crises by enabling experiences of meaningfulness, e g , through transparent and reliable modes of communicating goals and necessary intermediate steps  Moreover, health professionals are well advised to invite individuals to confront existential questions and struggles, and to encourage them to exercise self-control  The latter can be boosted by keeping higher-order goals salient—which again is inherently linked to an understanding of their meaning","Schnell, T.; Krampe, H.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.582352",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication details: Frontiers in Psychiatry;11, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COVID-19 and Parent-Child Psychological Well-being","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has changed American society in ways that are difficult to capture in a timely manner  With this study, we take advantage of daily survey data collected before and after the crisis started to investigate the hypothesis that the crisis has worsened parents' and children's psychological well-being  We also examine the extent of crisis-related hardships and evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of hardships will be associated with parent and child psychological well-being  METHODS: Daily survey data were collected between February 20 and April 27, 2020, from hourly service workers with a young child (aged 2-7) in a large US city (N = 8222 person-days from 645 individuals)  A subsample completed a one-time survey about the effects of the crisis fielded between March 23 and April 26 (subsample n = 561)  RESULTS: Ordered probit models revealed that the frequency of parent-reported daily negative mood increased significantly since the start of the crisis  Many families have experienced hardships during the crisis, including job loss, income loss, caregiving burden, and illness  Both parents' and children's well-being in the postcrisis period was strongly associated with the number of crisis-related hardships that the family experienced  CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with our hypotheses, in families that have experienced multiple hardships related to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, both parents' and children's mental health is worse  As the crisis continues to unfold, pediatricians should screen for mental health, with particular attention to children whose families are especially vulnerable to economic and disease aspects of the crisis  [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR] Copyright of Pediatrics is the property of American Academy of Pediatrics and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission  However, users may print, download, or email articles for individual use  This abstract may be abridged  No warranty is given about the accuracy of the copy  Users should refer to the original published version of the material for the full abstract  (Copyright applies to all Abstracts )","Gassman-Pines, Anna; Oltmans Ananat, Elizabeth; Fitz-Henley Ii, John","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2020-007294",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Pediatrics;146(4):1-9, 2020.; Publication details: Pediatrics;146(4):1-9, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Prevalence of post-traumatic symptomatology and anxiety among residential nursing and care home workers following the first COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy","The current COVID-19 pandemic has been officially linked to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across the globe in just a few months  It is particularly lethal for the elderly in general, as well as for populations residing in long-term stay facilities  By this time, those working and caring for high-risk populations have been exposed to very intense and sudden levels of physical and psychological strain  The situation has taken a particularly tragic turn in residential nursing and care homes (NCH), which were hit hard by the pandemic  In residential NCH, neither residents nor workers tend to have immediate access to the same expertise, medication and equipment as in hospitals, which exacerbates an already tense situation  Among the mental health conditions related to exposure to potentially traumatic events, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety are the most prevalent and scientifically recognized  In this survey-based epidemiological study, we test the prevalence of anxiety and post-traumatic symptomatology in residential nursing and care home workers-a group of individuals that has been largely neglected but who nonetheless plays a very important and sensitive role in our society  We do this by focusing on the North of Italy, the most affected region during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Italy  Using a single-stage cluster design, our study returns an estimate for the prevalence of moderate-to-severe anxiety and/or post-traumatic symptomatology of 43% (s e  = 3 09;95% CI [37-49]), with an 18% (s e  = 1 83;95% CI [14-22]) prevalence of comorbidity among workers of Northern Italian NCH between 15 June and 25 July 2020 (i e  12-52 days after the end of national lockdown)  Women and workers who had recently been in contact with COVID-19-positive patients/colleagues are more likely to report moderate-to-severe symptoms, with odds ratios of 2 2 and 1 7, respectively","Riello, M.; Purgato, M.; Bove, C.; MacTaggart, D.; Rusconi, E.","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200880",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: R Soc Open Sci;7(9):200880, 2020.; Publication details: R Soc Open Sci;7(9):200880, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A COVID-19 descriptive study of life after lockdown in Wuhan, China","On 8 April 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic  After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work  Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal  The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life-structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted  We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between 3 and 7 April 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18 and 22 April 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6 and 10 May 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25 and 29 May 2020 (Time 4)  This four-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents' psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted  The Stage 1 manuscript associated with this submission received in-principle acceptance (IPA) on 2 June 2020  Following IPA, the accepted Stage 1 version of the manuscript was preregistered on the OSF at https://osf io/g2t3b  This preregistration was performed prior to data analysis  Generally, our study found that: (i) a majority of people still continue to value self-isolation after lockdown was lifted;(ii) by the end of lockdown, people perceived gradual return to normality and restored structure of everyday life;(iii) the psychological well-being slightly improved after lockdown was lifted;(iv) people who used problem solving and help-seeking as coping strategies during lockdown had better well-being and mental health by the end of the lockdown;(v) those who experienced more disruptions in daily life during lockdown would display more indicators of psychological ill-being by the end of the lockdown","Zhou, T.; Nguyen, T.

"Physicians' Attitudes Towards Treating Patients in the Context of COVID-19 Pandemic in Pakistan","Background and objectives Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been the cause of a worldwide outbreak of respiratory illness, which has been declared as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The outbreak has posed a huge challenge to countries around the world and has resulted in a global lockdown. The pandemic has especially overburdened the healthcare sector, resulting in a shortage of personnel and equipment. Along with many other manifestations, it has resulted in stress and anxiety for the physicians as well. Furthermore, many healthcare workers have been reluctant in treating COVID-19 patients. This study aimed to explore the concerns of physicians in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the reasons for their reluctance to treat the patients. Methodology This descriptive cross-sectional study included 235 physicians from seven hospitals of Pakistan who were actively working amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from March 1, 2020, to May 30, 2020, using a structured online questionnaire. Participants were approached via non-probability convenient sampling. Two hundred and eight respondents were included in the data analysis. SPSS Statistics version 23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for data entry and analysis. Results A striking 83.7% (n=174) of the respondents expressed their reluctance to treat patients with COVID-19. Concerns they raised included one or more of the following four reasons; lack of proper personal protective equipment (PPE), fear of self-infection, excessive workload, and fear of transmitting the infection to their family members. Of note, 92% (n=161) of the respondents reported a lack of PPE while 74.1% (n=129) reported fear of transmitting the infection to their family members as reasons for their reluctance. The vast majority of the participants reported the need for psychological training to treat the patients' anxiety (95.2%, n=198). Many participants were afraid that their own anxiety might be affecting the quality of care patients were receiving (67.3%, n=140). Hence, most of the participants reported that psychological counseling should be provided (93.3%, n=194). Participants with family members older than 60 years were found to be reluctant to treat patients due to the risk of transmitting the infection to them (69.7%, n=145, p=0.001). Therefore, a major proportion of the participants (96.2%, n=200) felt that the hospitals should provide a place for them to rest and temporarily isolate themselves to avoid coming into contact with their family members. Conclusions We conclude that a major proportion of physicians is reluctant to treat their patients due to multiple factors. The grave situation of the pandemic has taken a toll on their mental health, which could be affecting the quality of care that the patients receive. Their concerns should be addressed to not only provide them with support and improve their working environment but also to ensure that they are fully equipped to provide state-of-the-art care to the patients in these grave times.","Ayub, Maheen; Arshad, Daneyal; Maqbool, Naheed; Zahid, Mahnoor; Malik, Rabia S; Rizvi, Zuhair Ali; Arshad, Usman; Khan, Saleem Ullah","https://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.10331",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Cureus;12(9): e10331, 2020 Sep 09.; Publication details: Cureus;12(9): e10331, 2020 Sep 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Associations between COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief with COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors: A cross-sectional online study","BACKGROUND: Online misinformation proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified from the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the association of misinformation receipt with socio-demographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief and psychological distress, and the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018. RESULTS: 67.78% respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (1.79, 1.27-2.51) sources of information. Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (1.47, 1.09-2.00), and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (7.33, 5.17-10.38). Misinformation belief was associated with poorer COVID-19 knowledge (High: 0.62, 0.45-0.84), and fewer preventive behaviors (&#8805; 7 behaviors: 0.54, 0.39-0.74). CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. Given the potential of undermining global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter proliferation of misinformation.","Lee, Jung Jae; Kang, Kyung Ah; Wang, Man Ping; Zhao, Shengzhi; Wong, Janet Yuen Ha; O'Connor, Siobhan; Yang, Sook Ching; Shin, Sun Hwa","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/22205",NA,"Country: CA; CANADÁ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Dynamics of psychological responses to COVID-19 in India: A longitudinal study","The novel COVID-19 pandemic has created chaos around the globe. To curb its spread, the Government of India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24th, 2020 for 21 days, which was extended further for a longer time. This long period of lockdown disrupted the routine of all citizens, affecting their psychological well-being. While recent studies showed the psychological burden of Indians during the pandemic, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals adjusted for sociodemographic covariates showed that anxiety (ß = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress (ß = 0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms (ß = 0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Our findings suggested that while the lockdown may help in effectively addressing this pandemic, the state and society at large need to be sensitive to the mental health impacts of a long-drawn-out lockdown. Such effects likely have long-term sequelae. The disproportionate impact on women needs immediate attention. Moreover, it behooves society to address the root causes driving the unequal distribution of psychological distress during such crises.","Gopal, Anvita; Sharma, Anupam Joya; Subramanyam, Malavika Ambale","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240650",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;15(10): e0240650, 2020.; Publication details: PLoS One;15(10): e0240650, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health among youth with physical health challenges","AIM: To examine mental health in conjunction with physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic among youth with physical health conditions compared to those without. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 622 youth aged 14 to 28 was conducted. Analyses were conducted to understand the changes in mental and physical health among youth in four groups: (a) participants with a friend or family member diagnosed with COVID-19, (b) participants with symptoms associated with COVID-19, (c) participants with atopic conditions (asthma and allergies), and (d) participants with other preexisting physical health conditions. RESULTS: Many participants with physical health concerns met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder, which was significantly higher than the rate found among participants without physical health conditions. Significantly greater declines in self-reported mental health were observed during the COVID-19 period compared to 3 months earlier among youth reporting physical health concerns compared to those without physical health concerns. Substance use does not appear to have been affected. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health concerns are highly prevalent among youth with physical health concerns, and also appear to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical health concerns appear to constitute risk factors for heightened mental health responses to the pandemic situation. System planners striving to adapt mental health services to meet social/physical distancing recommendations are urged to consider youth with physical health conditions and ensure that adequate integrated mental health and physical health supports are available to them.","Hawke, Lisa D; Monga, Suneeta; Korczak, Daphne; Hayes, Em; Relihan, Jacqueline; Darnay, Karleigh; Cleverley, Kristin; Lunsky, Yona; Szatmari, Peter; Henderson, Joanna","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eip.13052",NA,"Country: AU; AUSTRÁLIA; AUSTRALIA; AUSTRALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Early Interv Psychiatry;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Early Interv Psychiatry;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Implications of COVID19-induced nation-wide lockdown on children's behavior in Punjab, India","BACKGROUND: Lockdown is one of the prevalent tools which are used to control the spread of COVID 19 virus in India. Under the circumstances created during lockdown period, children are deprived from the social interaction and companionship, because of which they are susceptible to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in this study, efforts were to understand the impacts of lockdown on the mental status of the children of India and their specific causes. STUDY DESIGN: It is a questionnaire based study METHODS: A web based questionnaire was prepared and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India viz., Ludhiana, ShabizadaAjit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews were statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. RESULTS: Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively. 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment. Children (~76.3%) persistently urge to go outdoors and play with their friends, therefore, they could lag in social development. Further, observations from Pearson's correlation revealed that during lockdown children's mental health is significantly related to the area of their house, number of children in the family, qualification of their mother and socio-economic status of their family. CONCLUSIONS: This study made it evident that the mental health of the children residing in Punjab, India was compromised during the lockdown period induced by COVID 19 pandemic. Findings of this study may also trigger the international authorities to frame the guidelines of lockdown in the interest of mental health of their native children.","Sama, BhupinderKaur; Kaur, Palakpreet; Thind, Parteek Singh; Verma, ManpreetKaur; Kaur, Mandeep; Singh, Dapinder Deep","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cch.12816",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Care Health Dev;2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: Child Care Health Dev;2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

AIM: To determine the psychological status and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSD) among general population (except confirmed and suspected cases, and close contacts) and their association with the coping strategy types during the COVID-19 outbreak. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the community through snowball sampling with anonymous online questionnaires, using 28-item General Health Questionnaire, 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised and 28-item Brief Coping Inventory to measure their psychiatric disorders, PTSD level and coping strategies. RESULTS: Of the total 1109 participants, 42.65% and 67.09% self-reported psychiatric disorders and high PTSD level, respectively.

"Priorities for addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college student mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has already produced profound impacts on college students, with unprecedented directives for student relocation from their college campuses and dormitories mid-semester and coursework that took place through virtual learning. The current disruptions and anticipated potential long-term changes call for immediate prioritization regarding next steps for addressing college mental health and well-being. This viewpoint article highlights two urgent priorities for addressing current college mental health needs: the development of strategies for ensuring mental health service access, and intentional outreach to college students with special circumstances. The current crisis also represents an opportunity for campus administrators, mental health professionals, researchers, and policymakers to leverage innovative models of care as well as identity-related student assets, strengths, and resilience-promoting factors to support students' eventual return to campus and to respond more effectively to future massive disruptions.","Liu, Cindy H; Pinder-Amaker, Stephanie; Hahm, Hyeouk Chris; Chen, Justin A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1803882",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Am Coll Health;: 1-3, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication details: J Am Coll Health;: 1-3, 2020 Oct 13.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Economic hardship and mental health complaints during COVID-19","The COVID-19 economic crash is idiosyncratic because of its virtual standstill of economic activity. We therefore ask how individual labor market experiences are related to the development of mental health complaints in the spring of 2020. As clinical data collection was compromised during the lockdowns, standardized surveys of the European labor force provide an opportunity to observe mental health complaints as the crisis unfolded. Data are representative of active members of the labor force of six European nations that contained varying levels of COVID-19 burdens in terms of mortality and lockdown measures. We document a steep occupational prestige level gradient on the probability of facing economic hardship during the lockdowns-looming job loss, income loss, and workload decline-which evidently exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Analyses indicate a striking positive relationship between instantaneous economic hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown and expressing feelings of depression and health anxiety. Importantly, the magnitude of the association between such hardships and indicators of mental health deterioration is highly dependent on workers' occupational standing, revealing a second layer of exacerbating inequality.","Witteveen, Dirk; Velthorst, Eva","https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009609117",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Recommendations for the care of patients with bipolar disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","In recent months, there has been a rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), being now regarded as a global pandemic. In this context, the governments of different countries have established strict containment measures, and subsequent deconfinement measures, with consequential alterations in the rhythms and living habits of the population, including patients with bipolar disorder (BD), who are in an extremely vulnerable situation. The present paper aims to propose a number of recommendations, based on scientific evidence, for mental health professionals who may be in charge of BD patients during this health crisis in the coming months. Among these recommendations, careful monitoring of pharmacological treatment, reinforcing medication adherence, and surveillance of drug-drug interaction risk in cases where the patient is being treated for COVID-19 are of utmost importance.","Hernández-Gómez, Alba; Andrade-González, Nelson; Lahera, Guillermo; Vieta, Eduard","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.105",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Affect Disord;279: 117-121, 2020 Sep 28.; Publication details: J Affect Disord;279: 117-121, 2020 Sep 28.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Treatment of mental disorders in COVID-19 survivors","PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to explore the possible benefits of traditional Chinese medicine on the pathogenesis of psychological and mental health of COVID-19 survivors. METHODS: A literature search was conducted to confirm the effects of COVID-19 on psychological and mental health of survivors. In addition to this, on the basis of signs and symptoms, TCM were used on treat mental disorder as per suggested clinical and animal experimental data plus relevant records in classical Chinese medicine books written by Zhang Zhongiing during Han Dynasty. A series of treatment plans were prescribed for COVID-19 survivors with psychological and mental disorders. RESULTS: According to previous extensive studies focusing on effects on mental health of survivors, high incidence was observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) survivors. During investigations of mental health of COVID-19 patients and survivors, it is observed that they also had symptoms of mental disorders and immune dysfunction. Furthermore, it was also proposed that depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were most common mental disorders requiring special attention after the recovery from COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 were analyzed, and the TCM syndrome of the depression, anxiety and PTSD after recovered from COVID19 was interpreted as internal heat and Yin deficiency. These three mental disorders pertains the category of ""Lily disease"", ""hysteria"" and ""deficient dysphoria"" in TCM. CONCLUSION: Lily Bulb, Rhizoma Anemarrhena Decoction and Ganmai Dazao Decoction were used to treat depression. Suanzaoren Decoction, Huanglian Ejiao Decoction and Zhizi Chi Decoction were suggested for anxiety. Moreover, Lily Bulb, Rehmannia Decoction and Guilu Erxian Decoction were the formula for PTSD.","Ma, Ke; Wang, Xin; Feng, Shiyao; Xia, Xueshan; Zhang, Hongxiu; Rahaman, Abdul; Dong, Zhenfei; Lu, Yanting; Li, Xiuyang; Zhou, Xiaoyu; Zhao, Haijun; Wang, Yuan; Wang, Shijun; Baloch, Zulqarnain","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110810",NA,"Country: FR; FRANÇA; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Biomed Pharmacother;132: 110810, 2020 Sep 30.; Publication details: Biomed Pharmacother;132: 110810, 2020 Sep 30.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Management of psychiatric conditions and delirium during the COVID-19 pandemic across continents: The lessons thus far","Background: With the uncertainties of COVID-19, people infected by coronavirus present with diverse psychiatric presentations. Some centers have had to manage their patients with existing protocols, others have had to come up with innovations. We aim to report the challenges and good practices recorded in the management of psychiatric conditions and delirium coexisting with COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 era across continents. Material and Methods: Early Career Psychiatrists (ECPs) from across five continents were approached to provide their perspective on the management of psychiatric conditions in patients with COVID-19 and during the current pandemic. Results: We collected information about the experiences from ten countries. Commonalities were similar psychiatric presentations and poor preparedness across countries. Differences were varying innovations and adjustments made in the management of psychiatric conditions coexisting with COVID-19. Good practices which can be adopted by other countries are novel approaches such as telepsychiatry, proactive consultation-liaison units and enhanced community services targeted at circumventing challenges faced yet providing mental health services. Conclusions: This publication highlights the need for global preparedness in the mental health sector during outbreaks of infectious diseases. With our results we can conclude that there is the need for concerted efforts targeted at global and locally sensitive adaptation of existing protocols and the development of new guidelines for the management of psychiatric conditions for the present pandemic and subsequent occurrences.","Ojeahere, Margaret Isioma; de Filippis, Renato; Ransing, Ramdas; Karaliuniene, Ruta; Ullah, Irfan; Bytyçi, Drita Gashi; Abbass, Zargham; Kilic, Ozge; Nahidi, Mahsa; Hayatudeen, Nafisatu; Nagendrappa, Sachin; Shoib, Sheikh; Jatchavala, Chonnakarn; Larnaout, Amine; Maiti, Tanay; Ogunnubi, Oluseun Peter; El Hayek, Samer; Bizri, Maya; Schuh Teixeira, Andre Luiz; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Da Costa, Mariana Pinto","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2020.100147",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Brain Behav Immun Health;: 100147, 2020 Sep 19.; Publication details: Brain Behav Immun Health;: 100147, 2020 Sep 19.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on medical staff and the general public","To assess the psychological effects of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on medical staff and the general public. During the outbreak of COVID-19, an internet-based questionnaire included The Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the impact of the pandemic situation on the mental health of medical staff and general population in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Among the 1493 questionnaires completed, 827 (55.39%) of these were men, and 422 (28.27%) of these were medical personnel. The results suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected individuals significantly, the degree of which is related to age, sex, occupation and mental illness. There was a significant difference in PSS-10 and IES-R scores between the medical staff and the general population. The medical staff showed higher PSS-10 scores (16.813 ± 4.87) and IES-R scores (22.40 ± 12.12) compared to members of the general population PSS-10 (14.80 ± 5.60) and IES-R scores (17.89 ± 13.08). However, there was no statistically significant difference between the SDS scores of medical staff (44.52 ± 12.36) and the general public (43.08 ± 11.42). In terms of the need for psychological assistance, 50.97% of interviewees responded that they needed psychological counseling, of which medical staff accounted for 65.87% and non-medical staff accounted for 45.10%. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, great attention should be paid to the mental health of the population, especially medical staff, and measures such as psychological intervention should be actively carried out for reducing the psychosocial effects.","Chen, Biao; Li, Qing-Xian; Zhang, Heng; Zhu, Jia-Yong; Yang, Xu; Wu, Yu-Hang; Xiong, Jie; Li, Fu; Wang, Hua; Chen, Zhi-Tao","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12144-020-01109-0",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Curr Psychol;: 1-9, 2020 Oct 07.; Publication details: Curr Psychol;: 1-9, 2020 Oct 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Gibt es ein Post-COVID-Syndrom?; [Is there a post-COVID syndrome?]","For critically ill COVID-19 patients surviving the acute phase of the disease could possibly only mean having overcome the first stage of a long and challenging path. Physical, cognitive and psychological consequences seem to be realistic; however, do residual symptoms in patients who have returned to microbiological normalization constitute a post-COVID syndrome and which symptoms are principally possible in this context and are able to cause such a syndrome? It is no novelty that critically ill patients often still sustain functional limitations over a long period after discharge from hospital, in many cases even over many years. In most cases of COVID-19 it is too early for the diagnosis of a post-COVID syndrome. For this the symptoms would have to have lasted over a period of at least 6 months; therefore, only a post-infection fatigue can currently be spoken of. On top of this, even if patients recover physically they could be at particular risk of suffering from long-term mental health problems or perceive a reduced quality of life. Such findings exist not only after ARDS as many intensive care unit patients sustain long-term disorders, which is also known as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). To sum up, there is sufficient evidence for the possible existence of a post-COVID syndrome or for the justification to correspondingly designate these possible sequelae with persisting symptoms in this way. In any case, all efforts that enable a complete functional recovery and a return to a life after corona are justified.","Lamprecht, Bernd","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10405-020-00347-0",NA,"Country: DE; ALEMANHA; GERMANY; ALEMANIA; DEUSTCHLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Pneumologe (Berl);: 1-4, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication details: Pneumologe (Berl);: 1-4, 2020 Oct 08.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Risk for probable post-partum depression among women during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of the current study was to assess the risk for post-partum depression among women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the risk among women delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic. A cohort study was performed among women delivering singletons at term which were recruited in the maternity wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. Recruitment was done during the COVID-19 strict isolation period (March 18 and April 29, 2020). Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the results were compared to women delivering at the same medical center before the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to control for potential confounders. A total of 223 women who delivered during the COVID-19 strict isolation period were recruited. Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic had lower risk of having a high (> 10) or very high (&#8805; 13) EPDS score as compared with women delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic (16.7% vs 31.3%, p = 0.002, and 6.8% vs 15.2%, p = 0.014, for EPDS &#8805; 10 and EPDS &#8805; 13, respectively). These results remained similar in the multivariable logistic regression models, for both EPDS score &#8805; 10 and EPDS score &#8805; 13, while controlling for maternal age, ethnicity, marital status, and adverse pregnancy outcomes (adjusted OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.23-0.70, p = 0.001 and adjusted OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.15-0.74, p = 0.007 for EPDS score > 10 and > 13, respectively). In our population, delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with lower risk of post-partum depression.","Pariente, Gali; Wissotzky Broder, Orit; Sheiner, Eyal; Lanxner Battat, Talya; Mazor, Elad; Yaniv Salem, Shimrit; Kosef, Tamar; Wainstock, Tamar","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00737-020-01075-3",NA,"Country: AT; ÁUSTRIA; AUSTRIA; AUSTRIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Arch Womens Ment Health;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Arch Womens Ment Health;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Athens, Greece","BackgroundThe epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality. MethodsStudy population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis. ResultsThe mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age [â<U+0089>¥]65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. ConclusionOur finding of a beneficial effect of allergies and influenza vaccination against COVID-19 infection merits further investigation, as it may shed light in the mechanisms underlying disease progression and severity. Most importantly, it may assist in the implementation of efficient protective measures and public healthcare policies.","Dimitrios Giannoglou; Evangelia Meimeti; Xenia Provatopoulou; Kostantinos Stathopoulos; Kriton-Ioannis Roukas; Petros Galanis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211193",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on People with Hypertension","ObjectivesIt is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed. DesignThis retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions. MethodsBaseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured. ResultsAt baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%). ConclusionsAnxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.","Carissa Bonner; Erin Cvejic; Julie Ayre; Jennifer Isautier; Christopher Semsarian; Brooke Nickel; Carys Batcup; Kristen Pickles; Rachael Dodd; Samuel Cornell; Tessa Copp; Kirsten J McCaffery","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722",NA,"Database: PREPRINT-MEDRXIV; Publication type: preprint","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

An Empirical Investigation on the Association Between Introversion and the Psychological Impact of COVID19-Related Circumstantial Changes","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic has effected the implementation of social distancing and lockdown measures across the globe, and the psychological impact of associated life changes is experienced more severely by some individuals than others  Anecdotal evidence points to a common belief among the general public that introverts are faring better than their extraverted counterparts to this end  However, the claim lacks empirical research, and seems counterintuitive when the broader literature on the association between introversion and mental health is considered  The current study investigated whether the psychological impact of COVID19-related circumstantial changes was moderated by introversion, based on outcome measures across psychosocial, cognitive, and affective domains  The role of several demographic factors in determining COVID19-related mental health symptoms was also examined  One hundred and fourteen individuals (64 USA residents) completed measures of introversion, and reported on the extent to which they experienced loneliness, anxiety, depression and cognitive impairments as a function of COVID19-related circumstantial changes  Results showed that introversion predicted more severe loneliness, anxiety, and depression experienced as a function of COVID19-related circumstantial changes, but not cognitive impairments  Among the range of demographic factors examined (age, gender, living condition, recent unemployment), living with others (vs  living alone) predicted more severe COVID19-related mental health symptoms  However, these effects were only observed on outcome measures pertaining to anxiety and cognitive impairments, but not loneliness and depression  Current findings have implications for both consumers and disseminators of information on popular internet hubs  Current findings also highlight the possibility that living with others (close human affiliation) may have protective and detrimental effects on different domains of mental health during the COVID19 pandemic","Wei, M.","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.561609",NA,"Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Front Psychol;11:561609, 2020.; Publication details: Front Psychol;11:561609, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Coronavirus disease-19 in environmental fields: a bibliometric and visualization mapping analysis","A coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus has appeared in China by the end of 2019 and later recognized as a global pandemic. This pandemic has evolved as a global public health menace. It has affected every aspect of human life. In line with these concerns, governments and the scientific community react promptly to the outbreak of this pandemic. These efforts are devoted to develop vaccine and curative medicines. Further efforts are dedicated to assessing the impacts of the pandemic in relation to socioeconomic, psychological, and environmental dimensions. In this regard, it is important to follow up developments and research activities on this global issue. The present work intended to tracking the current hotspots and research trends on COVID-19 in environmental fields. Bibliometric analysis and visualization mapping were utilized with the objective of revealing and evaluating the developments in knowledge on COVID-2019 and its impacts based on a collection of environmental sources. A sum of 729 documents were collected from Scopus database limiting to environmental sources only. Of all these publications, 563 (77.2%) were articles, 56 (7.7%) were reviews, and 110 (15.0%) were others. China has the highest share of publications (163; 22.4%). It is followed by the USA (139; 19.15), and Italy (110; 15.1%). Most publications on COVID-19 were in prestigious journals. The most productive institution at global level was Chinese Academy of Sciences, China (24 documents; 3.3%). The most prevalent topics are in relation to impacts of the pandemic on air quality, mental health, psychological, and economic aspects. The development of these topics is based on cross-sectional studies, evidence-based tools, remote sensing, satellite mapping, geographic information systems, market analysis and sampling. The progress of environmental research on COVID-19 will guide the development of global environmental strategies to control future global environmental risks.","Zyoud, Shaher H; Zyoud, Ahed H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-020-01004-5",NA,"Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Environ Dev Sustain;: 1-29, 2020 Oct 06.; Publication details: Environ Dev Sustain;: 1-29, 2020 Oct 06.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Helping Couples Connect during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial of an Awareness, Courage, and Love Intervention","BACKGROUND: A second pandemic of mental health problems due to COVID-19 is predicted, suggesting a demand for interventions to mitigate its impacts. This study evaluated the effectiveness of an online psychological intervention based on the Awareness, Courage, and Love (ACL) model from Functional Analytic Psychotherapy to promote closeness between couples during the pandemic. METHOD: Thirty-one couples were randomised into either the intervention or control group for a 2-hour online group session. The intervention was designed to increase closeness between couples, whereas control group members watched a movie. In both groups, participants responded to two instruments that assessed the couple's relationship. Generalised linear mixed modeling was used to compare the change scores over time between the groups, with random effects used to control for the correlation within a couple and the correlation within the individual. RESULTS: The intervention group's closeness increased by 23 per cent while the control group's closeness increased only 2 per cent. A week later, a significant difference between the two groups emerged on closeness. CONCLUSION: Online ACL protocols requiring minimal training offer a promising intervention to quickly buffer against stress for large numbers of individuals during pandemic times.","Tsai, Mavis; Hardebeck, Emerson; Ramos, Fabiana Pinheiro; Turlove, Hannah; Nordal-Jonsson, Kaisa; Vongdala, Akoly; Zhang, Wen; Kohlenberg, Robert J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12241",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Appl Psychol Health Well Being;2020 Oct 11.; Publication details: Appl Psychol Health Well Being;2020 Oct 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 Pandemic's Effects on Disease and Psychological Outcomes of People With Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Portugal: A Preliminary Research","AIMS: No empirical research on the psychological impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on people living with IBD, a population known to typically present high levels of anxiety and depression and to be potentially vulnerable to COVID-19, has yet been conducted. This study aimed to explore the links between contextual variables related to the COVID-19 pandemic and disease and psychological outcomes. METHODS: The sample included 124 Portuguese patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis (85.48% women) who completed self-reported measures in an online survey during April 2020. RESULTS: Fear of contracting COVID-19 and medication adherence were both high and unrelated. About half of the sample presented moderate (37.10%) to severe (14.50%) anxiety. Normal and mild anxiety levels were at 29.80% and 18.50%, respectively. Regarding depressive symptoms, 51.60% of the sample presented normal levels, 27.40% mild severity, 16.10% moderate, and 4.8% severe. No differences were found between Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. Regression analyses showed that anxiety explained IBD symptom perception (ß = 0.29; P = 0.022); fear of contracting COVID-19 (ß = 0.35; P < 0.001) and IBD symptom perception (ß = -0.22; P = 0.009) explained depressive symptoms; and fear of contracting COVID-19 (ß = 0.41; P < 0.001), IBD symptom perception (ß = 0.26, P < 0.001), and being in isolation (ß = -0.16, P = 0.041) explained anxiety. Type of medication was not linked to these outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to be affecting adherence to medication but seems to present relevant effects on psychological well-being. Inflammatory bowel disease health care professionals should be attentive of patients' psychological response to this pandemic and of its possible consequences on disease expression. This study additionally provided a psychometrically sound measure of fear of contracting COVID-19.","Trindade, Inês A; Ferreira, Nuno B","https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izaa261",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Inflamm Bowel Dis;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Inflamm Bowel Dis;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Severely increased generalized anxiety, but not COVID-19-related fear in individuals with mental illnesses: A population based cross-sectional study in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic affected individuals, governments, and health care centers all around the globe. Social isolation obligation, restricted working shifts, and curfews posed unprecedented challenges for the population. Social isolation, boredom, and financial problems have been shown to stress peoples' mental health in previous comparable pandemics and even in regular situations. Individuals with a mental illness may particularly be at risk due to an already instable mental health status. While research mainly focused on the pandemic's impact on somatic health care and risk group patients, psychological obstacles caused by legal restrictions and their impact on already mentally affected individuals have been discussed, but so far only scarcely been investigated in a large sample. For this study, 12,028 people completed an online-survey during that time in Germany, when the COVID-19 outbreak gained momentum with a surge in cases and death rates as well as a lockdown of the public life. Generalized anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-2), distress (distress thermometer) and COVID-19-specific items, especially COVID-19-related fear, were assessed in healthy individuals, patients suffering from mental illnesses, and in patients with chronic somatic diseases, known to be at risk for an unfavorable course of COVID-19. Results show that the COVID-19-pandemic significantly worsens psychometric scores throughout the population - individuals with already heightened levels, like people with mental illnesses now reach concerning levels. Surprisingly, even though generalized anxiety, depressive symptoms, and perceived distress are elevated in individuals with mental illness, these individuals seem to be less affected by explicit COVID-19-related fear, than the general population or individuals with chronic somatic diseases. This study thus objectively quantifies the psychological impact of COVID-19 in a large sample and provides evidence for not only the public, but also critically affected individuals with a mental illness.","Skoda, Eva-Maria; Bäuerle, Alexander; Schweda, Adam; Dörrie, Nora; Musche, Venja; Hetkamp, Madeleine; Kohler, Hannah; Teufel, Martin; Weismüller, Benjamin","https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0020764020960773",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020960773, 2020 Oct 10.; Publication details: Int J Soc Psychiatry;: 20764020960773, 2020 Oct 10.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Depression and Anxiety During the COVID-19 Pandemic in an Urban, Low-Income Public University Sample","Mental health disparities in the aftermath of national disasters and the protective role of socioeconomic status are both well documented. We assessed the prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among underresourced public university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Between April 8, 2020, and May 2, 2020, adult students (N = 1,821) across the CUNY system completed an online survey examining COVID-19-related stressors and mental health and sociodemographic factors. Using multivariable logistical regression to assess the association between COVID-19-related stressors and depression and anxiety symptoms, we found a high prevalence and severity of depression and anxiety symptoms. We also observed that more exposure to COVID-19-related stressors was associated with increased depressive (27.0%, 41.4%, and 63.1% for low-, medium-, and high-level stressors, respectively) and anxiety symptoms (19.3%, 34.6%, 52.2%). In addition, the degree of exposure to COVID-19-related stressors served as an important predictor of depression and anxiety symptoms. Compared to high levels of stressors, the odds of depression were 0.2, 95% CI [0.2, 0.3] for low- and 0.4, 95% CI [0.3, 0.5] for medium-level stressors; for anxiety, the odds were 0.2, 95% CI [0.2, 0.3] for low and 0.05, 95% CI [0.4, 0.6] for medium stressors. Finally, household savings of less than $5,000 increased the risk of anxiety but not depression symptoms, OR = 1.3, 95% CI [1.0,1.6]. Together, these findings tell a devastating story of psychological distress among students from lower socioeconomic groups living in the COVID-19 epicenter of the U.S. pandemic.","Rudenstine, Sasha; McNeal, Kat; Schulder, Talia; Ettman, Catherine K; Hernandez, Michelle; Gvozdieva, Kseniia; Galea, Sandro","https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jts.22600",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Trauma Stress;2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: J Trauma Stress;2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 worry, mental health indicators, and preparedness for future care needs across the adult lifespan","OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a source of worry for many, but older adults have been identified as more vulnerable to serious cases and may therefore feel more concerned about the virus. We assessed whether COVID-19 worry was related to indicators of mental health and preparedness for future care, in an adult lifespan sample. METHOD: An online study (n = 485; age 18-82, M = 49.31, SD = 15.39) included measures of COVID-19 worry, depression, general anxiety, health anxiety, hostile and benevolent ageism, preparedness for future care, and demographic information. RESULTS: Age and living alone were positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry, as were health anxiety, general anxiety, benevolent ageism, and preparedness for future care needs via gathering information. A significant interaction indicated that among individuals reporting lower health anxiety, greater preference for gathering information was positively associated with greater COVID-19 worry; however, for individuals having high health anxiety, gathering information about future care was not related to COVID-19 worry, as their COVID-19 worry levels were moderately high. CONCLUSION: Older age was associated with greater COVID-19 worry, perhaps in response to the much publicized greater risk for negative outcomes in this population. In spite of this specific concern, indicators of older adults' continued mental health emerged. Preparedness for future care is also highlighted, as well as clinical implications.","Maxfield, Molly; Pituch, Keenan A","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2020.1828272",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Aging Ment Health;: 1-8, 2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Aging Ment Health;: 1-8, 2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Structural Basis of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV Antibody Interactions","The 2019 coronavirus pandemic remains a major public health concern. Neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) represent a cutting-edge antiviral strategy. We focus here on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, and discuss current progress in antibody research against rampant SARS-CoV-2 infections. We provide a perspective on the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2-derived nAbs, comparing these with existing SARS-CoV-derived antibodies. We offer insight into how these antibodies cross-react and cross-neutralize by analyzing available structures of spike (S) glycoprotein-antibody complexes. We also propose ways of adopting antibody-based strategies - such as cocktail antibody therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 - to overcome the possible resistance of currently identified mutants and mitigate possible antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) pathologies. This review provides a platform for the progression of antibody and vaccine design against SARS-CoV-2, and possibly against future coronavirus pandemics.","Gavor, Edem; Choong, Yeu Khai; Er, Shi Yin; Sivaraman, Hariharan; Sivaraman, J","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.it.2020.09.004",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Trends Immunol;2020 Sep 17.; Publication details: Trends Immunol;2020 Sep 17.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic","With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the greatest global challenge in a generation. The full extent of the mental health impact is, as yet, unknown, but is anticipated to be severe and enduring. In this Special Issue dedicated to mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic, we aim to lay the foundation for an improved understanding of how COVID-19 is affecting mental health services both in Ireland and globally. This Special Issue highlights how the mental health effects of COVID-19 stretch to almost every element of society.

"COVID-19 pandemic lockdown-induced altered sleep/wake circadian rhythm, health complaints and stress among traffic police personnel in India","COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus-2, capable of high human transmission. To protect against the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Health Organization proposed intervening guidance that included movement restrictions, isolation, restriction of national and international travel or movement, and full or partial closure of organizations and institutions. Police personnel play a vital role in safeguarding the spread of COVID-19; thus, potentially causing severe stress due to increased consignment and direct exposure to infection during duty. The study aimed to determine the effect of the added stress of the COVID-19 pandemic and population lockdown on the sleep/wake 24 h rhythm of traffic police. A concise online questionnaire survey was conducted among the traffic police personnel of India. Collected data were analyzed statistically. Disorientation of working schedule, fear of being vulnerable to disease, pressure of maintaining law, and orders during lockdown increased stress level. The survey identified discontinuation of sleep, shift of mid-sleep time, increase in depression, plus stress and anxiety among traffic police personnel that affected their chronobiological milieu. Proper awareness of adequate health and safety measures, use of personnel protection equipment, regular conversation with family members, and meditation can help reduce stress during this pandemic situation.","Dey, Arindam; Majumdar, Piya; Saha, Atanu; Sahu, Subhashis","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07420528.2020.1831524",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Chronobiol Int;: 1-9, 2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Chronobiol Int;: 1-9, 2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 pandemic and mental distress in Multiple Sclerosis: implications for clinical management","BACKGROUND: in multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favour the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. METHODS: we explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to information collected via web-survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress. RESULTS: 845 subjects (497 MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. MS patients showed higher scores than controls for depression (p=0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The SEM explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (ß=0.509 and ß=0.836, p<0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (ß=0.386 and ß=0.297, p<0.001); avoidance, social support and watching TV contributed to passive attitude (ß=0.301, ß=0.243 and ß=0.212, p<0.001). As per the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (ß=0.855, p<0.001) while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (ß=0.729 and ß=-0.456, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: as practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool to face COVID-19 related mental distress.","Costabile, Teresa; Carotenuto, Antonio; Lavorgna, Luigi; Borriello, Giovanna; Moiola, Lucia; Inglese, Matilde; Petruzzo, Martina; Trojsi, Francesca; Ianniello, Antonio; Nozzolillo, Agostino; Cellerino, Maria; Boffa, Giacomo; Rosa, Laura; Servillo, Giuseppe; Moccia, Marcello; Bonavita, Simona; Filippi, Massimo; Lanzillo, Roberta; Brescia Morra, Vincenzo; Petracca, Maria","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ene.14580",NA,"Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Eur J Neurol;2020 Oct 11.; Publication details: Eur J Neurol;2020 Oct 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"What Is the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Quality of Life and Other Patient-reported Outcomes? An Analysis of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and its associated lockdowns in many parts of the world, have changed our daily lives and may have a psychological impact on around the globe. However, it is unknown how this influences the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) of patients involved in ongoing clinical research and medical care. For both the current and potential future lockdowns, it is important to determine if PROMs collected during such a period can be interpreted with confidence. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Is there a difference in quality of life between patients in the COVID-19 period group (March 23, 2020 to May 4, 2020) and patients in a reference period group (from the same period in 2018 or 2019)? (2) Is there a difference in pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception between patients in the COVID-19 period group and patients in the reference period group? METHODS: This study was part of a large cohort study with routine outcome measures of patients with hand and wrist conditions. To answer our research questions, we analyzed two samples because not all PROMs were sent to participants at the same time points after treatment. The first sample consisted of all participants who completed PROMs on quality of life (QoL), pain, and hand function at their final follow-up time point, which was either 3, 6, or 12 months post-treatment. The second sample consisted of participants who completed PROMs 3 months post-treatment on anxiety, depression, and illness perception. Each sample consisted of two groups: a COVID-19 period group and a reference period group. We included 1613 participants in the first sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 616; reference period group: n = 997) and 535 participants in the second sample (COVID-19 period group: n = 313; reference period group: n = 222). The primary outcome was QoL, expressed in the EuroQol 5-Dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) index score. Secondary outcomes were the other domains on the EQ-5D, as well as pain, hand function, anxiety, depression, and illness perception. RESULTS: We found no between-group differences in the EQ-5D index score (standardized mean difference 0.035; p = 0.98). Furthermore, there were no between-group differences in PROM scores for hand function, anxiety, or depression. There were, however, a few small differences in subdomain items regarding pain and illness perception, but we believe in aggregate that these are unlikely to make a clinically important difference in our main finding. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdown had no influence on QoL and had little influence on secondary outcomes in participants who were part of the Hand-Wrist Study Cohort. This finding implies that PROMs data collected during this period can be used with confidence in clinical research. Our findings indicate that when a pandemic like this occurs again, we can continue to use PROMs for analysis in clinical research or routine outcome measures.

"Self-isolation: A significant contributor to cannabis use during the COVID-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Emerging research suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in self-reported isolation and loneliness in a large proportion of the population. This is particularly concerning given that isolation and loneliness are associated with increased cannabis use, as well as using cannabis to cope with negative affect. Objective: We investigated whether self-isolation due to COVID-19 and using cannabis to cope with depression were unique and/or interactive predictors of cannabis use during the pandemic, after controlling for pre-pandemic levels of cannabis use. Method: A sample of 70 emerging adults (mean age = 23.03; 34.3% male) who used both alcohol and cannabis pre-pandemic completed measures of cannabis use (i.e., quantity x frequency) and a novel COVID-19 questionnaire between March 23 and June 15, 2020. Pre-pandemic cannabis use levels had been collected four months earlier. Results: Linear regressions indicated self-isolation and coping with depression motives for cannabis use during the pandemic were significant predictors of pandemic cannabis use levels after accounting for pre-pandemic use levels. There was no interaction between coping with depression motives and self-isolation on cannabis use during the pandemic. Conclusions: Those who engaged in self-isolation were found to use 20% more cannabis during the pandemic than those who did not. Our results suggest that self-isolation is a unique risk factor for escalating cannabis use levels during the pandemic. Thus, self-isolation may inadvertently lead to adverse public health consequences in the form of increased cannabis use.","Bartel, S J; Sherry, S B; Stewart, S H","https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08897077.2020.1823550",NA,"Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Subst Abus;: 1-4, 2020 Oct 12.; Publication details: Subst Abus;: 1-4, 2020 Oct 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Eating disorder pathology and compulsive exercise during the COVID-19 public health emergency: Examining risk associated with COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty","COVID-19 has led to disruptions in daily living and increased uncertainty about physical, financial, social, and psychological consequences, which may contribute to anxiety, eating disorder (ED) pathology, and compulsive exercise. Individual factors, such as intolerance of uncertainty, may impact risk for ED pathology and CE in response to COVID-19 anxiety. The current study examined associations between COVID-19 anxiety, trait intolerance of uncertainty, and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty and ED pathology and compulsive exercise. Undergraduate participants (Nâ€‰= 295) completed a series of online questionnaires between March and April of 2020. COVID-19 anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty were associated with ED pathology, but not compulsive exercise. Additionally, both trait and COVID-19 intolerance of uncertainty moderated associations between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and ED pathology. COVID-19 anxiety was more strongly related to compulsive exercise and ED pathology for individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. COVID-19 anxiety may increase risk for ED pathology and may be specifically important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise among individuals with lower intolerance of uncertainty. These results contribute to a growing body of research aimed at understanding the mental health consequences of the COVID-19 and suggest that individual factors (e.g., anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty) are important in determining risk for ED pathology and compulsive exercise in the context of the pandemic.","Scharmer, Martinez, Gorrell, Reilly, Donahue, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23395","20201024","COVID-19; anxiety; compulsive exercise; eating disorder; intolerance of uncertainty","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Hospital staff well-being during the first wave of COVID-19: Staff perspectives","The purpose of this research is to determine the impact of working during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of staff at one 600-bed acute hospital in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. This exploratory study is part of a larger mixed methods survey project, reporting the qualitative data from an on-line survey of clinical staff working at one acute hospital between April 16th and May 13th, 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses to five free-text questions were analysed using inductive content analysis. 321 medical, nursing, allied health and non-clinical staff responded to the survey. Respondents reported anxiety, fear and uncertainty related to the pandemic, from the perspectives of work, home, family and community. They reported feeling confused by inconsistent messages received from government, hospital executive, managers and media. Seven themes were identified: (i) worrying about patient care, (ii) changed working conditions, (iii) working in the changed hospital environment, (iv) impact of the pandemic, (v) personal isolation and uncertainty, (vi) leadership and management and (vii) additional support needed for staff. Despite the pandemic being comparatively well-controlled in Australia, all disciplines reported a high degree of anticipatory anxiety. Staff working in healthcare require both managerial and psychological support to minimise anxiety and promote well-being and resilience in order to deal with the health crisis. Regular unambiguous communication directing the way forward is crucial.","Digby, Winton-Brown, Finlayson, Dobson, Bucknall","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12804","20201024","COVID-19; acute care; hospital staff; mental health; well-being","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Electrocardiographic findings at presentation and clinical outcome in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection","The main severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome. Recent studies, however, reported that cardiac injury, as assessed by troponin levels, is associated with a worse outcome in these patients. No study hitherto assessed whether the simple standard electrocardiogram (ECG) may be helpful for risk stratification in these patients. We studied 324 consecutive patients admitted to our Emergency Department with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standard 12-lead ECG recorded on admission was assessed for cardiac rhythm and rate, atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction, abnormal Q/QS wave, ST segment and T wave changes, corrected QT interval, and tachyarrhythmias. At a mean follow-up of 31 Â± 11 days, 44 deaths occurred (13.6%). Most ECG variables were significantly associated with mortality, including atrial fibrillation (P = 0.002), increasing heart rate (P = 0.002), presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB; P &lt; 0.001), QRS duration (P &lt;0 .001), a QRS duration of â‰¥110 ms (P &lt; 0.001), ST segment depression (P &lt; 0.001), abnormal Q/QS wave (P = 0.034), premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; P = 0.051), and presence of any ECG abnormality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.40-8.76; P &lt; 0.001]. At multivariable analysis, QRS duration (P = 0.002), QRS duration â‰¥110 ms (P = 0.03), LBBB (P = 0.014) and presence of any ECG abnormality (P = 0.04) maintained a significant independent association with mortality.

"Higher Executive Control Network Coherence Buffers Against Puberty-Related Increases in Internalizing Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Early pubertal maturation has been posited to be a biopsychosocial risk factor for the onset of internalizing psychopathology in adolescence; further, early-maturing youths exhibit heightened reactivity to stressful events. School closures and enforced social distancing, as well as health and financial uncertainties, during the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to adversely affect mental health in youths, particularly adolescents who are already at risk for experiencing emotional difficulties. The executive control network (ECN) supports cognitive processes required to successfully navigate novel challenges and regulate emotions in stressful contexts. We examined whether functional coherence of the ECN, measured using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 5 years before the pandemic (T1), is a neurobiological marker of resilience to increases in the severity of internalizing symptoms during COVID-19 in adolescents who were in more advanced stages of puberty at T1 relative to their same-age peers (NÂ = 85, 49 female). On average, participants reported an increase in symptoms from the 3 months before pandemic to the 2 most recent weeks during the pandemic. We found that early-maturing youths exhibited greater increases in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic if their ECN coherence was low; in contrast, relative pubertal stage was not associated with changes in internalizing symptoms in adolescents with higher ECN coherence at T1. These findings highlight the role of the functional architecture of the brain that supports executive functioning in protecting against risk factors that may exacerbate symptoms of internalizing psychopathology during periods of stress and uncertainty.","Chahal, Kirshenbaum, Miller, Ho, Gotlib","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpsc.2020.08.010","20201024","Adolescence; COVID-19; Executive control network; Internalizing; Puberty; Stress","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Commentary on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on opioid use disorder treatment among Indigenous communities in the United States and Canada","This commentary focuses on how some Indigenous communities in the United States (U.S.) and Canada are addressing the opioid epidemic within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, from the perspective of the co-authors as researchers, clinicians, and pharmacists working within or among Indigenous communities in three eastern Canadian provinces and two western U.S. states. The pandemic has likely exacerbated opioid use problems among Indigenous communities, especially for individuals with acute distress or comorbid mental illness, or who are in need of withdrawal management or residential services. In response to the pandemic, we discuss first how greater prescription flexibility has facilitated and even increased access to medications for opioid use disorder. Second, we describe how Indigenous-serving clinics have expanded telemedicine services, albeit not without some challenges. Third, we note challenges with restricted participation in traditional Indigenous healing practices that can be helpful for addiction recovery. Fourth, we mention providers' worries about the pandemic's impact on their patients' mental health and safety. We argue that certain treatment transformations may be helpful even after the pandemic is over, through enhancing access to community-grounded treatment, decreasing stigma, and promoting patient self-efficacy.","Wendt, Marsan, Parker, Lizzy, Roper, Mushquash, Venner, Lam, Swansburg, Worth, Sorlagas, Quach, Manoukian, Bernett, Radin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108165","20201024","COVID-19; Indigenous Peoples; Medication for opioid use disorder; Opioid use disorder; Opioid-agonist treatment; Telemedicine","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"High Levels of Stress Due to the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic among Parents of Children with and without Chronic Conditions across the USA","The 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic led to community-wide measures affecting parents and children such as school/daycare closures, job losses, and interruptions in medical care for children with chronic diseases. This is the first study to describe the level of stress and mental health of parents of either healthy children or children with chronic conditions, during the 2020 pandemic. A representative sample of US parents was recruited from 10-17 April 2020. Parents completed online questionnaires about the past 7 days, including the Perceived Stress Scale, Resilient Coping Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale, Kansas Marital Satisfaction Scale, Parental Stress Scale, PROMIS Anxiety and Depression scales and various other pandemic-related stress questions Results: Levels of stressors (e.g., job loss, school closures, etc.) were high during this time (e.g., 79% of children attended home/online school) and parents reported being moderately to highly stressed. Rates of clinical anxiety (44.6%) and depression (42.2%) were high. Parents of children with chronic conditions reported higher levels of stress and worse mental health, but did not differ from other parents in dealing with stress or interruptions in work, child schooling, and marital satisfaction. The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced unprecedented levels of stress for parents, especially those of children with chronic conditions.

"Association between Physical Activity and Mood States of Children and Adolescents in Social Isolation during the COVID-19 Epidemic","The COVID-19 epidemic adversely affects the lifestyle of people. This study aimed to examine the impacts of social isolation on physical activity (PA) levels and mood states of children and adolescents and to explore the correlation between them during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 9979 children and adolescents (11.63 Â± 1.23 years old) from Yan'an, China volunteered to participate in this study and completed online questionnaires. PA and mood states were measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and Profile of Mood States (POMS), respectively. The results showed that the mean of students' moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 23.19 min per day. The total mood disturbance in the moderate and high-level PA groups were significantly lower than those in the low-level PA group (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Additionally, boys and girls had significant differences in PA levels (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01), and the PA levels of students in different grades were also significantly different (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Meanwhile, boys' mood states were worse than girls'. The Grade 4 in primary schools had the worst mood states while Grade 5 had the best mood states. The results suggested that the MVPA of students has dropped badly, compared with the results of previous studies investigated in normal times. In addition, the PA level had a significantly positive impact on the mood states of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sex and grades were factors which affected the PA levels and mood states. This study can help policymakers and healthcare professionals understand PA and mood states of Chinese children and adolescents during the epidemic. We should pay attention to the changes in PA levels and mood states of children and adolescents.","Zhang, Zhu, Kang, Qiu, Lu, Sun","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17207666","20201024","COVID-19; mental health; physical activity; social isolation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Validation of the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires for Chronic Medical Conditions: A Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Cohort study","Fear associated with medical vulnerability should be considered when assessing mental health among individuals with chronic medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions. Fifteen initial items were generated based on suggestions from 121 people with the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). Patients in a COVID-19 SSc cohort completed items between April 9 and 27, 2020. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and item analysis were used to select items for inclusion. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate internal consistency reliability and convergent validity. Factor structure was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in follow-up data collection two weeks later. 787 participants completed baseline measures; 563 of them completed the follow-up assessment. Ten of 15 initial items were included in the final questionnaire. EFA suggested that a single dimension explained the data reasonably well. There were no indications of floor or ceiling effects. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91.

"The psychological impact of the coronavirus disease pandemic on hospital workers in Daegu, South Korea","This study aimed to assess the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by healthcare workers and other personnel during the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. The sample consisted of 2554 hospital workers (i.e., physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, and auxiliary staff members) who were working in Yeungnam University Hospital in Daegu, South Korea. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was administered to the hospital workers twice over a 2Â week interval. A high-risk group, identified on the basic of first total IES-R, was assessed further with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) and the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGIS) scale and was offered periodic psychiatric consultations on a telephone. The participating nurses and auxiliary staff members had significantly higher IES-R scores (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01) than the physicians. During the second evaluation, the IES-R scores of the high-risk participants had decreased by 13.67Â Â±Â 16.15 points (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01), and their CGI-S scores had decreased by 1.00Â Â±Â 0.74 points (pÂ &lt;Â 0.01). The psychological symptoms of the high-risk group who received telephone-based psychiatric consultation showed improvement after 2Â weeks. The present findings suggest that hospital workers experience high levels of emotional stress during a pandemic. In particular, the present findings underscore the need to provide more information and support to nurses and other administrative workers. There is a need for greater awareness about the importance of mental health care among hospital workers, and rapid and ongoing psychiatric interventions should be provided to workers during the pandemic period.","Jo, Koo, Seo, Yun, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2020.152213","20201025","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease; Hospital worker; Mental health; Psychiatric consultation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Accessibility and allocation of public parks and gardens in England and Wales: A COVID-19 social distancing perspective","Visiting parks and gardens supports physical and mental health. We quantified access to public parks and gardens in urban areas of England and Wales, and the potential for park crowdedness during periods of high use. We combined data from the Office for National Statistics and Ordnance Survey to quantify (i) the number of parks within 500 and 1,000 metres of urban postcodes (i.e., availability), (ii) the distance of postcodes to the nearest park (i.e., accessibility), and (iii) per-capita space in each park for people living within 1,000m. We examined variability by city and share of flats. Around 25.4 million people (~87%) can access public parks or gardens within a ten-minute walk, while 3.8 million residents (~13%) live farther away; of these 21% are children and 13% are elderly. Areas with a higher share of flats on average are closer to a park but people living in these areas visit parks that are potentially overcrowded during periods of high use. Such disparity in urban areas of England and Wales becomes particularly evident during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown when local parks, the only available out-of-home space option, hinder social distancing requirements. Cities aiming to facilitate social distancing while keeping public green spaces safe might require implementing measures such as dedicated park times for different age groups or entry allocation systems that, combined with smartphone apps or drones, can monitor and manage the total number of people using the park.","Shoari, Ezzati, Baumgartner, Malacarne, Fecht","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241102","20201023",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Suicide and the Elderly During the COVID-19 Pandemic: An Overview of Different Suicide Theories","To expand knowledge during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with regard to suicide prevention among the elderly population by providing recommendations for interview strategies using 3 suicide theories. Two hypothetical geriatric suicide cases (1 low lethality and 1 high lethality) are presented and categorized according to 3 suicide theories: interpersonal theory of suicide, three-step theory of suicide, and hopelessness theory of depression. In crisis intervention, the clinician's interview must match the intrinsic belief of the suicide attempter to enable engagement and rapport. Use of different aspects of the 3 suicide theories can be useful but are dependent on the emergent nature of the attempt. The need for identification and treatment of those with mental health issues, especially among the elderly population, and collaborative multidiscipline management teams is increasing during the current global pandemic. Specific interview strategies are needed when engaging with elderly suicidal patients.

"The Use of Storytelling With Grief Reactions in Children During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Children are living through the COVID-19 pandemic and the traumatic changes the virus has had on the structure and schedule of their daily existence. They are struggling to cope with the loss of the normalcy of their lives and the resulting sense of grief. As the loneliness and isolation required by social distancing can worsen grief, it is important to increase communication with children and include strategies to reduce stress and increase resilience. Storytelling is the oldest form of teaching and has multiple benefits, including identifying emotional states, developing a vocabulary to allow self-advocacy, encouraging the use of strategy, and promoting a sense of hope. In addition, models of positive psychological attitude can diminish anxiety and divert attention to a more productive and positive outlook. Stories are powerful tools and convey thoughts, ideas, and values while encouraging purposeful discussion. For children, hearing stories is a rich avenue to gain insight, resources, and approaches to cope with these unprecedented times. It would be helpful to explore the long-term effects on children of COVID-19-related confinement and loss.

"Mental Health Predictors After the COVID-19 Outbreak in Korean Adults","The current study was conducted to investigate mental health levels in Korean adults during the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and determine their predictors. The study was conducted online, and 334 adults from 14 locations in Korea participated. Data collection was conducted from May 19 to May 24, 2020, using a questionnaire consisting of general and COVID-19-related characteristics, perceived physical health, individual and community resilience, and mental health. For data analysis, descriptive statistics, t test, one-way analysis of variance, and hierarchical regression were used. In cases where women were more vulnerable to mental health problems and gender was controlled, regression analysis showed that individual resilience (Î² = -0.212, p &lt; 0.001), perceived physical health (Î² = -0.160, p = 0.004), and community resilience (Î² = -0.119, p = 0.031) had an effect on mental health. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, communities should screen groups vulnerable to mental health problems and develop an integrated mental health program that incorporates predictors of mental health difficulties.

"Factors Associated With Mental Health Disorders Among University Students in France Confined During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and quarantine measures have raised concerns regarding their psychological effects on populations. Among the general population, university students appear to be particularly susceptible to experiencing mental health problems. To measure the prevalence of self-reported mental health symptoms, to identify associated factors, and to assess care seeking among university students who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in France. This survey study collected data from April 17 to May 4, 2020, from 69â€¯054 students living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. All French universities were asked to send an email to their students asking them to complete an online questionnaire. The targeted population was approximately 1â€¯600â€¯000 students. Living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. The rates of self-reported suicidal thoughts, severe distress, stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the 20-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State subscale), and the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. Covariates were sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators (ie, loss of income or poor quality housing), health-related data, information on the social environment, and media consumption. Data pertaining to care seeking were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. A total of 69â€¯054 students completed the survey (response rate, 4.3%). The median (interquartile range) age was 20 (18-22) years. The sample was mainly composed of women (50â€¯251 [72.8%]) and first-year students (32â€¯424 [47.0%]). The prevalence of suicidal thoughts, severe distress, high level of perceived stress, severe depression, and high level of anxiety were 11.4% (7891 students), 22.4% (15â€¯463 students), 24.7% (17â€¯093 students), 16.1% (11â€¯133 students), and 27.5% (18â€¯970 students), respectively, with 29â€¯564 students (42.8%) reporting at least 1 outcome, among whom 3675 (12.4%) reported seeing a health professional. Among risk factors identified, reporting at least 1 mental health outcome was associated with female gender (odds ratio [OR], 2.10; 95% CI, 2.02-2.19; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001) or nonbinary gender (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 2.99-4.27; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), precariousness (loss of income: OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.22-1.33; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001; low-quality housing: OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 2.06-2.57; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), history of psychiatric follow-up (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 3.09-3.48; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), symptoms compatible with COVID-19 (OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.49-1.61; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), social isolation (weak sense of integration: OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 3.35-3.92; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001; low quality of social relations: OR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.49-2.75; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001), and low quality of the information received (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.49-1.64; Pâ€‰&lt;â€‰.001).

Thus, in this study, we discovered novel pyrazole analogs as a potent nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Ä¸B) inhibitor. The compounds were assessed for NF-Ä¸B transcriptional inhibitory activity in RAW264.7 cells after stimulation with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), revealing Compound 6c as the most potent analog among the tested series. The effect of Compound 6c was further investigated on the levels of interleukin-1Î², tumor necrosis factor-Î±, and interleukin-6 in LPS-stimulated RAW267.4 cells by enzyme immunoassay, where it causes a significant reduction in the level of these cytokines. In Western blot analysis, Compound 6c also causes the inhibition of inhibitor kappa B-Î±Â and NF-ÎºB.

"Epidemiology of mental health problems in COVID-19: a review","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic affecting health and wellbeing globally. In addition to the physical health, economic, and social implications, the psychological impacts of this pandemic are increasingly being reported in the scientific literature. This narrative review reflected on scholarly articles on the epidemiology of mental health problems in COVID-19. The current literature suggests that people affected by COVID-19 may have a high burden of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety disorders, stress, panic attack, irrational anger, impulsivity, somatization disorder, sleep disorders, emotional disturbance, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and suicidal behavior. Moreover, several factors associated with mental health problems in COVID-19 are found, which include age, gender, marital status, education, occupation, income, place of living, close contact with people with COVID-19, comorbid physical and mental health problems, exposure to COVID-19 related news and social media, coping styles, stigma, psychosocial support, health communication, confidence in health services, personal protective measures, risk of contracting COVID-19, and perceived likelihood of survival. Furthermore, the epidemiological distribution of mental health problems and associated factors were heterogeneous among the general public, COVID-19 patients, and healthcare providers. The current evidence suggests that a psychiatric epidemic is cooccurring with the COVID-19 pandemic, which necessitates the attention of the global health community. Future epidemiological studies should emphasize on psychopathological variations and temporality of mental health problems in different populations. Nonetheless, multipronged interventions should be developed and adopted to address the existing psychosocial challenges and promote mental health amid the COVID-19 pandemic.","Hossain, Tasnim, Sultana, Faizah, Mazumder, Zou, McKyer, Ahmed, Ma","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.24457.1","20201024","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Epidemiology; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Review","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Identifying the Associated Risk Factors of Sleep Disturbance During the COVID-19 Lockdown in Bangladesh: A Web-Based Survey","Bangladesh, a developing country with a lower-middle-income and one of the world's most densely populated areas, has been severely affected by COVID-19. This global epidemic is not only affecting the physical health of the patients but also causing severe psychological effects among those who have not yet been infected. Sleep disturbance is one of the key symptoms of major depression and one of the proven risk factors for suicide. The objective of this study is to identify the risk factors associated with sleep disturbance which has developed as a general impact of COVID-19 and new normal life during the lockdown (a measure to control the spread of COVID-19) in Bangladesh. Demographic characteristics, COVID-19, and lockdown related information have been collected from 1,128 individuals by conducting a web-based survey. Respondent's perspective regarding sleep disturbance during COVID-19 lockdown is considered as the outcome of interest which is dichotomous. Descriptive statistics methods have been applied to explore the distribution of respondent's demographic characteristics. Pearson's chi-square tests have been performed to relate the sleep disturbance status of the respondents to their demographic, personal, and COVID-19 related information. Furthermore, a multivariable logistic regression model has been adopted to identify the significant association of sleep disturbance with the demographic, COVID-19, and lockdown related information of respondents during the COVID-19 lockdown in Bangladesh. The prevalence of sleep disturbance during the COVID-19 lockdown is found to be higher among participants aged 31-40 years. Gender disparity has also been observed in favor of male participants, whereas no significant regional heterogeneity has been found. Working from home or doing online classes during the lockdown has been found as a potential predictive factor of sleep disturbance. Losing a job has been considered as an adverse economic effect of COVID-19, which also induces sleep disturbance. Perception regarding the risk of getting infected and anxiety triggered the chance of developing sleep disturbance. The sleeping schedule is also found as a risk factor for sleep disturbance. Evidence-based policies are required to combat psychological challenges that have arisen due to COVID-19, primarily targeting the groups who are largely suffering from sleep disturbance.","Ara, Rahman, Hossain, Ahmed","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.580268","20201024","AOR; AUC; COVID-19; anxiety; home confinement; lock down; sleep disturbance","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

We recruited 1404 healthy adults following the Bangladesh government's lockdown announcement. A questionnaire comprising the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale was used to define mental health. The overall mean score for well-being was 42.4, indicating that 51.9% of adults suffered from poor mental health. And within that 48% of males and 57% of females were depressed. The mean scores for government workers, unemployed workers, and business employees were 45.1, 39.6, and 39.5, respectively. Confounding adjustments in multivariable linear regression models revealed that married women, unemployed and business communities, and individuals returning to villages were heavily depressed. Stay-at-home orders had significant repercussions on mental health and created a gender disparity in depression among adults. Suggestions include promoting mental health for women, unemployed, and business individuals. Married women need to be taken into special consideration as their mental well-being is worse. Older people (50Â years of age and over) reported a high day-to-day variation in their mental health. These results should be factored in when discussing the mental health of adults and communities to cope with quarantine.","Ali, Ahsan, Khan, Khan, Hossain","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13104-020-05345-2","20201025","Bangladesh; Covid-19 pandemic; Depression; Lockdown; Mental well-being; Social distance","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

In addition to proactive measures addressing physical survival needs and health protection, China has launched a mental health support system to cope with the widespread psychological stress during the pandemic and its aftermath. In this debate, the authors attempted to depict and reflect upon the overall framework of China's mental health support, with particular reference to the psychological intervention in response to COVID-19 over the last few months. Although a lot of effort has been made to meet the mental health needs, the accessibility, acceptability and effectiveness of the support system still have much room for improvement. Therefore, it is very important to re-think the predicament and challenge on ways of enhancing public mental health emergency responses in China.

"Medical student support for vulnerable patients during COVID-19 - a convergent mixed-methods study","The coronavirus pandemic has exerted significant impacts on primary care, causing rapid digital transformation, exacerbating social isolation, and disrupting medical student and General Practice [GP] trainee education. Here we report on a medical student telephone initiative set-up by a final year GP trainee (the equivalent of a family medicine resident), which aimed to support patients at high risk and vulnerable to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [Covid-19]. In addition, it was hoped the project would mitigate a digital divide, enable proactive anticipatory planning, and provide an active learning environment to compensate for the pandemic's impact on medical education. Thirty-three medical students conducted daily telephone conversations with high risk and vulnerable patients as specified by the initial NHSE published lists. They confirmed public health messages, offered details for voluntary support groups, established need for medication delivery, explored levels of digital connectivity, and prompted discussions around end-of-life choices. Students had access to online reflective resources and daily remote debriefing sessions with the GP trainee. A convergent mixed-methods evaluation was subsequently undertaken, using quantitative process and descriptive data and individual qualitative interviews were conducted according to a maximal variation sampling strategy with students, General Practitioners [GPs], and the GP trainee. Inductive thematic analysis was then applied with cross-validation, respondent validation, and rich evidential illustration aiding integrity. Ninety-seven 'high risk' and 781 'vulnerable' calls were made. Individuals were generally aware of public heath information, but some struggled to interpret and apply it within their own lives. Therefore respondents felt students provided additional practical and psychological benefits, particularly with regard to strengthening the links with the community voluntary groups. The project was widely liked by students who reported high levels of skill development and widened awareness, particularly valuing the active learning environment and reflective feedback sessions. This study demonstrates utilization of medical students as wider assets within the primary health care team, with an initiative that enables support for vulnerable patients whilst promoting active medical education. Ongoing integration of students within 'normal' primary health care roles, such as chronic disease or mental health reviews, could provide similar opportunities for supported active and reflective learning.","Hughes, Beard, Bowman, Chan, Gadsby, Hughes, Humphries, Johnston, King, Knock, Malhi, Mickute, Okpalugo, Oliver, Perera, Pickles, Pollock, Pullen, Samuels, Sexton, Shutler, Smith, Tanner, Ladds","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-020-02305-z","20201025","COVID-19; Education; General practice; Medical students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Smart technology for physical activity and health assessment during COVID-19 lockdown","The worldwide lockdown in response to COVID-19 pandemics has often led to physical inactivity and social distancing. When combined, these factors may affect quality and life and increase the risk of different diseases. Therefore, assessment of physical activity levels should be encouraged to monitor and identify those at a higher risk of inactivity. Smart technology is a promising tool to assess physical activity and health, and may be particularly useful during a period of general lockdown. An online survey was developed and shared among the Italian general population to collect data about physical activity and daily routine changes between January 2020 and the lockdown period from 23rd to 29th of March. Participants were asked to provide data such as daily step count (Steps) or heart rate (HR) measured and collected by their smart technology devices. Four hundred participants were included in the final analysis. During the lockdown, the number of steps dropped from 8,284Â±4,390 to 3,294Â±3,994 steps (p&lt; 0.001), while mean peak HR decreased from 61.3Â±18.2% to 55.9Â±17.3% (p&lt; 0.001).

"Introduction to the special issue on the HEALing Communities Study","The severity of the overdose epidemic underscores the urgent need for innovative and high impact interventions that promote the rapid penetration and scale up of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in communities profoundly affected by fatal opioid overdose. This special issue shares scientific advancements in implementation research design and evaluation of a novel data-driven community-based intervention. The HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a four-year study that is designed to examine the effectiveness of the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention. The CTH intervention supports the dissemination of EBPs in 67 communities across four high-burdened states-Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The diversity in these communities in terms of rural-urban status, race-ethnicity and other social determinants of health facilitates generalizability of results to other communities across the US. The nine papers in this special issue describe critical elements that constitute the HCS framework and design. This includes the implementation of EBPs that have a substantial impact on fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach, communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma against people with OUD and MOUD interventions, and the process of community engagement. This includes how to form community coalitions and gain their commitment, and steps taken to mobilize coalitions to pursue EBP implementation and ensure EBPs are adapted for community needs.

"Disparities in outpatient visits for mental health and/or substance use disorders during the COVID surge and partial reopening in Massachusetts","To examine changes in outpatient visits for mental health and/or substance use disorders (MH/SUD) in an integrated healthcare organization during the initial Massachusetts COVID-19 surge and partial state reopening. Observational study of outpatient MH/SUD visits January 1st-June 30th, 2018-2020 by: 1) visit diagnosis group, 2) provider type, 3) patient race/ethnicity, 4) insurance, and 5) visit method (telemedicine vs. in-person). Each year, January-June 52,907-73,184 patients were seen for a MH/SUD visit. While non-MH/SUD visits declined during the surge relative to 2020 pre-pandemic (-38.2%), MH/SUD visits increased (9.1%)-concentrated in primary care (35.3%) and non-Hispanic Whites (10.5%). During the surge, MH visit volume increased 11.7% while SUD decreased 12.7%. During partial reopening, while MH visits returned to 2020 pre-pandemic levels, SUD visits declined 31.1%; MH/SUD visits decreased by Hispanics (-33.0%) and non-Hispanic Blacks (-24.6%), and among Medicaid (-19.4%) and Medicare enrollees (-20.9%). Telemedicine accounted for ~5% of MH/SUD visits pre-pandemic and 83.3%-83.5% since the surge. MH/SUD visit volume increased during the COVID surge and was supported by rapidly-scaled telemedicine. Despite this, widening diagnostic and racial/ethnic disparities in MH/SUD visit volume during the surge and reopening suggest additional barriers for these vulnerable populations, and warrant continued monitoring and research.","Yang, Landrum, Zhou, Busch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.genhosppsych.2020.09.004","20201024","COVID-19; Disparities; Health care systems; Mental health; Substance use disorders","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and perceived strain among caregivers tending children with special needs","While COVID-19 outbreak has had adverse psychological effects in children with special needs, the mental state and burden on their caregivers during this pandemic has yet to be reported. The objectives of this study were to describe the mental health status and the change in perceived strain among caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics, use and perspective on tele-rehabilitation, homecare therapy, caregiver's strain and mental health. The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 %, 20.5 % and 36.4 % respectively. A significant difference in caregiver strain (pâ€¯&lt;â€¯ 0.001, effect size = 0.93) was observed during the outbreak compared to levels pre-outbreak (pre-outbreak strain was measured retrospectively). Caregivers not using tele-rehabilitation along with a perception of it being a poor medium for rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental health whereas a negative perception on homecare therapy were strongly associated with higher psychological symptoms and strain. This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We identified several factors associated with poor mental health and perceived strain that can be used to help safeguard caregivers.","Dhiman, Sahu, Reed, Ganesh, Goyal, Jain","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103790","20201024","COVID-19; Caregiver strain; Children with special needs; Mental health; Telerehabilitation","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathway and in silico approaches for vaccine design against COVID-19","COVID-19 has forsaken the world because of extremely high infection rates and high mortality rates. At present we have neither medicine nor vaccine to prevent this pandemic. Lockdowns, curfews, isolations, quarantines, and social distancing are the only ways to mitigate their infection. This is badly affecting the mental health of people. Hence, there is an urgent need to address this issue. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel Betacorona virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) which has emerged in the city of Wuhan in China and declared a pandemic by WHO since it affected almost all the countries the world, infected 24,182,030 people and caused 825,798 death as per data are compiled from John Hopkins University (JHU). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive (+) sense RNA of âˆ¼30â€‰kb nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence similarity (âˆ¼79%) with SARS-CoV. Envelope and nucleocapsids are two evolutionary conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 having a sequence identity of about 96% and 89.6%, respectively as compared to SARS-CoV. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Transmission of this virus in the human occurs through the respiratory tract and decreases the respiration efficiency of lungs. Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with an incubation period of 2-14 days. The virus first infects the lower airway and bind with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of alveolar epithelial cells. Due to the unavailability of drugs or vaccines, it is very urgent to design potential vaccines or drugs for COVID-19. Reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic play an important role in designing potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The suitable vaccine selects for SARS-CoV-2 based on binding energy between the target protein and the designed vaccine. The stability and activity of the designed vaccine can be estimated by using molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. This review mainly focused on the brief up to date information about COVID-19, molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathways involved during COVID-19 infection. It also covers potential vaccine design against COVID-19 by using various computational approaches. SARS-CoV-2 enters brain tissue through the different pathway and harm human's brain and causes severe neurological disruption.","Singh, Rai, Singh, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jchemneu.2020.101874","20201024","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasion; molecular characterization; pathogen-host interaction; vaccine development","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Impact of COVID on College Student Mental Health and Wellness","To test the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID) pandemic on the emotions, behavior, and wellness behaviors of first-year college students. 675 first-year university students completed a full assessment of behavioral and emotional functioning at the beginning of the spring semester 2020. Of these, 576 completed the same assessment at the end of the spring semester, 600 completed at least one item from a COVID-related survey following the onset of COVID pandemic, and 485 completed nightly surveys of mood and wellness behaviors on a regular basis before and after the onset of the COVID crisis. Externalizing problems (M=-0.19, 95% CI=-0.06-0.33, p=0.004) and attention problems (M=-0.60, 95% CI=-0.40-0.80, p&lt;0.001) increased following onset of COVID, but not internalizing symptoms (M=0.18, 95% CI=-0.1-0.38, p=0.06). Students who were enrolled in a campus wellness program were less affected by COVID in terms of internalizing symptoms (Î²= 0.40, SE=0.21, p=0.055) and attention problems (Î²= 0.59, SE=0.21, p=0.005) than those not in the wellness program. Nightly surveys of both mood (Î²= -0.10, SE=0.03, p=0.003) and daily wellness behaviors (Î²= -0.06, SE=0.03, p=0.036), but not stress (Î²= 0.02, SE=0.03, p=0.58), were negatively affected by the COVID crisis. The overall magnitude of these COVID-related changes were modest, but persistent across the rest of the semester, and different from patterns observed in a prior year. COVID and associated educational/governmental mitigation strategies had a modest but persistent impact on mood and wellness behaviors of first-year University students. Colleges should prepare to address the continued mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Copeland, McGinnis, Bai, Adams, Nardone, Devadanam, Rettew, Hudziak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.08.466","20201022","COVID; adolescence; college behavior change; substance use; wellness; young adulthood","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological impact of mass quarantine on population during pandemics-The COVID-19 Lock-Down (COLD) study","Quarantine often is an unpleasant experience. The aim of this study is to explore the degree of psychological distress in terms of-Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict 21 days mandatory lockdown. We hypothesize that quantification of psychological impact of current situation will help us to modify the policies and implementation strategies. This assessment might also help in future to keep targeted services in place, to cope up with the psychological distress of the quarantined population. A cross sectional survey design was adopted to assess the psychological state of general population in India, during the COVID-19 mandatory lockdown period, with the help of a validated questionnaire. The reported prevalence of depression was around 30.5%, which was the highest among the variables of psychological health. Anxiety was reported by 22.4%, followed by stress which was seen in 10.8% of respondents. In the third week the incidence of depression (37.8% versus 23.4%; p&lt;0.001), anxiety (26.6% versus 18.2%; p&lt;0.001) and stress (12.2% versus 9.3%; p&lt;0.045) was reported to be significantly higher as compared to second week. Our results suggest a progressively detrimental impact of lockdown on various aspects of psychological health. We noticed around eight to ten fold increase in the prevalence of depression (30.5%) and anxiety (22.4%) during lockdown, as compared to baseline statistics in Indian population (3Â·1-3Â·6% for depressive disorders and 3Â·0-3Â·5% for anxiety disorders).","Pandey, Bansal, Goyal, Garg, Sethi, Pothiyill, Sreelakshmi, Sayyad, Sethi","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240501","20201022",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Socioeconomic status and well-being during COVID-19: A resource-based examination","The authors assess levels and within-person changes in psychological well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction) from before to during the COVID-19 pandemic for individuals in the United States, in general and by socioeconomic status (SES). The data is from 2 surveys of 1,143 adults from RAND Corporation's nationally representative American Life Panel, the first administered between April-June, 2019 and the second during the initial peak of the pandemic in the United States in April, 2020. Depressive symptoms during the pandemic were higher than population norms before the pandemic. Depressive symptoms increased from before to during COVID-19 and life satisfaction decreased. Individuals with higher education experienced a greater increase in depressive symptoms and a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 in comparison to those with lower education. Supplemental analysis illustrates that income had a curvilinear relationship with changes in well-being, such that individuals at the highest levels of income experienced a greater decrease in life satisfaction from before to during COVID-19 than individuals with lower levels of income. We draw on conservation of resources theory and the theory of fundamental social causes to examine four key mechanisms (perceived financial resources, perceived control, interpersonal resources, and COVID-19-related knowledge/news consumption) underlying the relationship between SES and well-being during COVID-19. These resources explained changes in well-being for the sample as a whole but did not provide insight into why individuals of higher education experienced a greater decline in well-being from before to during COVID-19.

"Mental health and counseling intervention for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) during the COVID-19 pandemic: perspectives from Italy","Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an inherited disorder of fibrovascular tissue, transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. This rare disease can involve one or more organs and clinical manifestations interest several medical specialties. A review of recent literature and our clinical experience shows that COVID-19 pandemic greatly influences the autonomy and psychic sphere of patients with HHT, causing them further distress. Often patients affected by HHT experience a sense of loneliness due to the rarity of this pathology and COVID-19 pandemic adds a burden for them and their caregivers who have to face emotional experiences that interfere with personal, social and working functioning. Multidisciplinary approach and web-mediated counseling intervention could offer a valid and personalized support for patients affected by HHT and their caregivers during quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic.","Marano, Gaetani, Gasbarrini, Janiri, Sani, Mazza","https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202010_23246","20201023",NA,"PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Putatively lethal ingestion of isopropyl alcohol-related case: interpretation of post mortem isopropyl alcohol and acetone concentrations remains challenging","Isopropyl alcohol, or propan-2-ol (IPA), is found in numerous chemicals including alcohol-based hand rubs whose use has been recently widely extended to the general population since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. This widespread of IPA use could potentially, but not necessarily, be responsible for an increase in IPA poisoning cases (e.g., in alcoholics and/or for suicide attempt, even more in a lockdown situation). Forensic identification of IPA-related fatalities remains challenging as IPA post mortem detection can also result from antemortem or post mortem production, or post mortem contamination. In order to illustrate this issue, we report the case of a 33-year-old man found dead with a bottle of pure IPA liquid close to him. Toxicological positive results only consisted in IPA (464, 260, 465 and 991Â mg/L) and acetone (1560, 2340, 3040 and 1360Â mg/L) in blood, vitreous humour, urine and bile, respectively (determinations using headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detection). These IPA absolute concentrations and IPA-to-acetone ratios appear inferior to those usually reported in the literature (higher than 1000Â mg/L and 1.1, respectively) in IPA poisoning cases. In conclusion, this death can be cautiously regarded as an IPA ingestion-related fatality in the hypothesis of a survival time which have promoted IPA metabolism to acetone: this hypothesis is supported by the putative limited IPA-ingested dose. This report emphasizes the fact that post mortem IPA and acetone concentration interpretation involves to take account of (i) results in multiple biological specimens, (ii) complete case history, and (iii) a search of possible IPA presence at the scene of death.","Dumollard, Wiart, Hakim, Demarly, Morbidelli, Allorge, Gaulier","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00414-020-02444-4","20201024","Acetone; Fatality; Forensic; Isopropanol; Toxicology","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Prevalence of mental health problems and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers in specialized COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China: A cross-sectional survey","China has been severely affected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since December 2019. Military healthcare workers in China have experienced many pressures when combating COVID-19. This study aimed to investigate the current psychological status and associated risk factors among military healthcare workers. We collected data from 194 military healthcare workers from three inpatient wards in two specialized COVID-19 hospitals using a web-based cross-sectional survey. The survey covered demographic information, the patient health questionnaire-9, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, and the patient health questionnaire-15. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to explore potential risk factors for mental health problems. The overall prevalence rates of depressive, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 37.6%, 32.5%, and 50%, respectively. Rates of severe depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms were 5.2%, 3.6%, and 15.5%, respectively. In 22.7% of cases, comorbidities existed between depression, generalized anxiety, and somatization. A junior-grade professional title was associated with depression, older age was associated with generalized anxiety and somatization, and short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were associated with all three symptoms. The prevalence of depression, generalized anxiety, and somatic symptoms among military healthcare workers in specialized COVID-19 hospitals is high during the current COVID-19 outbreak. A junior-grade professional title, older age, short sleep duration, and poor sleep quality significantly affect military healthcare workers' mental health. Continuous surveillance and monitoring of the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak should be routine to promote mental health among military healthcare workers.","Pan, Xiao, Ren, Xu, Zhang, Yang, Liu, Hao, Zhao, Bai","https://doi.org/10.1111/appy.12427","20201022","coronavirus disease 2019; depressive symptoms; generalized anxiety; mental health; somatic symptoms","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Increased Resilience Weakens the Relationship between Perceived Stress and Anxiety on Sleep Quality: A Moderated Mediation Analysis of Higher Education Students from 7 Countries","High levels of perceived stress and anxiety among university students are a global concern and are known to negatively influence sleep. However, few studies have explored how stress response styles, like psychological resilience and rumination, might alter these relationships. Using validated tools, perceived stress, anxiety, stress response styles, and sleep behaviors of undergraduate and graduate students from seven countries during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic were characterized in order to examine the relationships between these factors using mediation and moderation analyses. Students enrolled in universities in China, Ireland, Malaysia, Taiwan, South Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States were recruited in May 2020. A total of 2254 students completed this cross-sectional study. Perceived stress and anxiety were negatively associated with sleep quality through the mediation of rumination. Increased psychological resilience weakened the relationships between perceived stress and anxiety on sleep quality. The majority of students reported that COVID-19 negatively influenced their mental health and sleep quality but not sleep duration. Based on these results, university students would likely benefit from sleep education and mental health promotion programs that include trainings to increase psychological resilience and reduce rumination, particularly during times of increased stress.","Du, Zan, Cho, Fenton, Hsiao, Hsiao, Keaver, Lai, Lee, Ludy, Shen, Swee, Thrivikraman, Tseng, Tseng, Tucker","https://doi.org/10.3390/clockssleep2030025","20201023","COVID-19; anxiety; psychological resilience; rumination; sleep; stress; university students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on the mental health status of undergraduate medical students in a COVID-19 treating medical college: a prospective longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic is found to affect the mental health of the population. Undergraduate medical students are especially prone to mental health disorders and hence could be more vulnerable to the impact of the pandemic. A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on 217 undergraduate medical students in a medical college at Chennai, India. Depression, anxiety, and stress levels were recorded using Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 Items (DASS21) before and during the COVID-19 outbreak in India in December 2019 and June 2020, respectively. In the follow-up survey, in addition to DASS21, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess sleep quality and a self-administered questionnaire to assess the impact of COVID-19 related stressors were used. The self-administered questionnaire assessed the status of COVID-19 testing, interactions with COVID-19 patients, self-perceived levels of concerns and worries related to academics (COVID-19-AA (academic apprehensions)) and those pertaining to the self and family/friends (COVID-19-GA (general apprehensions)). Cross-sectional and longitudinal comparison of overall scores of depression, anxiety, and stress and scores stratified by gender, year of study, place of residence and monthly family income were performed. Predictors for depression, anxiety, and stress during COVID-19 were investigated using adjusted binary logistic regression analysis and results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI). A <i>P</i> value &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The average scores of depression, anxiety, and stress during the baseline survey were 7.55 Â± 7.86, 4.6 Â± 6.19 and 7.31 Â± 7.34 with the prevalence (95% Cl) of 33.2% [27-39.9%], 21.2% [16-27.2%] and 20.7% [15.5-26.7%]; in follow-up survey, the mean scores were 8.16 Â± 8.9, 6.11 Â± 7.13 and 9.31 Â± 8.18 with the prevalence being 35.5% [29.1-42.2%], 33.2% [27-39.9%] and 24.9% [19.3-31.2%] for depression, anxiety, and stress respectively. There was a significant increase in both the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), with depression remaining unchanged during COVID-19, irrespective of gender, year of study, place of residence and family's monthly income. Poor sleep quality, higher levels of baseline depression, anxiety, and stress, higher COVID-19-GA, COVID-19 patients in family/friends and direct interactions with COVID-19 patients were found to be significant predictors of negative mental health in undergraduate medical students. COVID-19-AA was not significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. The COVID-19 pandemic appears to negatively affect the mental health of the undergraduate medical students with the prevalence and levels of anxiety and stress being increased, and depression symptoms remaining unaltered. Addressing and mitigating the negative effect of COVID-19 on the mental health of this population is crucial.","Saraswathi, Saikarthik, Senthil Kumar, Madhan Srinivasan, Ardhanaari, Gunapriya","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.10164","20201023","Anxiety; COVID-19; DASS21; Depression; Longitudinal study; Mental health; PSQI; Sleep quality; Stress; Undergraduate medical students","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Stress, Anxiety, and Change in Alcohol Use During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings Among Adult Twin Pairs","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has impacted the lives of people worldwide since being declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Social restrictions aimed at flattening the curve may be associated with an increase in stress and anxiety, which may increase the use of alcohol as a coping mechanism. The objective of this study was to examine if stress and anxiety were associated with changes in alcohol use in a sample of adult twins. Twins allowed us to control for genetic and shared environmental factors that would confound the alcohol - mental health relationship. Twins (N = 3,971; 909 same-sex pairs) from the Washington State Twin Registry (WSTR) completed an online survey examining several health-related behaviors and outcomes and their self-reported changes due to COVID-19. About 14% of the respondents reported an increase in alcohol use. We found an association between both stress and anxiety and increased alcohol use, where twins with higher levels of stress and anxiety were more likely to report an increase in alcohol consumption. The associations were small and confounded by between-family factors and demographic characteristics. However, there was no significant difference in stress or anxiety levels between non-drinkers and those who reported no change in alcohol use.

"Psychosocial Aspects of COVID-19 in the Context of Palliative Care - A Quick Review","In a resource-poor country like India, where the health-care systems are difficult to access, overburdened, and unaffordable to many, the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can be devastating. The increased burden of serious health-related suffering can impact the well-being of health-care workers, patients, and their families alike. The elderly, the frail, the vulnerable, and those with multiple comorbidities are disproportionately affected. Palliative care, with its comprehensive and inclusive approach, has much to offer in terms of alleviating the suffering, particularly those caused by the distressing physical and psycho-socio-spiritual symptoms, the complex medical decision-making, end-of-life care issues, and grief and bereavement, and needs to be integrated into the pathway of care provision in COVID-19. Psychosocial issues contribute to and amplify suffering and are often underestimated and undertreated and not accessible to many. Empowering frontline professionals in the core concepts of psychosocial support and palliative care thus becomes an absolute necessity. This quick review was done by a group of palliative care physicians and mental health experts from India to develop recommendations for physical and psychosocial care in the context of COVID-19. This review was done as part of that process and highlights the role and challenges of the psychosocial domain of palliative care in the context of COVID-19 situation in India.","Rao, Spruijt, Sunder, Daniel, Chittazhathu, Nair, Leng, Sunil Kumar, Raghavan, Manuel, Rijju, Vijay, Prabhu, Parameswaran, Venkateswaran","https://doi.org/10.4103/IJPC.IJPC_183_20","20201023","Communication skills; coronavirus disease 2019; end-of-life care; palliative care; psychosocial care; spiritual care","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Concerns and Coping Strategies of Persons Under Institutional Quarantine During SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The World Health Organization has declared severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic. The interventions employed by various health authorities in combating the infection may help in eliminating the threat; however, they have long-term cognitive and mental health effects on the population. The primary objective was to assess the prevalent concerns and coping strategies and perspectives in persons suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infection under institutional quarantine in India during the period from April 2020 to May 2020. Its a cross-sectional observational study conducted in the National Cancer Institute, Jhajjar, India. After ethical clearance, convenience sampling was done. Relevant demographic details were obtained. Health-care professionally administered questionnaire to assess psychological concerns and coping mechanisms. All statistics are deemed to be descriptive only. The most common physical concern was fever seen in 37% of respondents, followed by cough in 31% and sore throat in 29%. In terms of emotional concerns, 55.3% of respondents were worried and 43% were anxious and 33% were sad. About 80.6% of participants selected support from family and friends helped them cope during the institutional quarantine. 57% maintained a daily routine, 70% selected praying, and 45% used music as a coping strategy. Only 2% felt that they were unable to cope. It highlights that the psychological impact of illness on affected individuals should not be overlooked as it may have the potential to cause major psychiatric morbidity. It also provides a crucial assessment of their coping mechanisms.","Singh, Kumar, Rathore, Vig, Vallath, Mohan, Bhatnagar","https://doi.org/10.4103/IJPC.IJPC_176_20","20201023","Coping; SARS-CoV-2; emotional; psychological; quarantine; symptom","PubMed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychiatric symptomatology associated with depression, anxiety, distress, and insomnia in health professionals working in patients affected by COVID-19: A systematic review with meta-analysis","Background Health professionals are key personnel to containing infectious diseases like COVID-19. In the face of long work shifts (that reach 16 h per day on average), the risk of getting infected by a high-infectious disease and the lack of enough biological protection measures, mental suffering among health professionals suddenly became evident. Method We carried out an updated meta-analysis to investigate the psychiatric impacts on health professionals in the face of the physical and psychological conditions to which they are subjected due to the high demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Papers were researched in four databases from December 2019 to April 2020. In total, eight papers were included in the study. Results Health professionals working to fight COVID-19 are being more severely affected by psychiatric disorders associated with depression, anxiety, distress and insomnia, stress, and indirect traumatization than other occupational groups. No significant differences were observed in the publication bias. Conclusion There is a strong association between health professionals and COVID-19 in terms of psychiatric repercussions. Our meta-analysis showed that health professionals have a higher level of indirect traumatization, in which the level of damage exceeds psychological and emotional tolerance and indirectly results in psychological abnormalities.

"Viral, host and environmental factors that favor anthropozoonotic spillover of coronaviruses: An opinionated review, focusing on SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2","Environmental factors play a key role in the zoonotic transmission of emerging pathogenic viruses as mankind is constantly disturbing wildlife's ecosystems usually by cutting down forests to build human settlements or by catching wild animals for food, which deprives the viruses of their natural hosts and gives them opportunity to infect humans. In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002–2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.141483","20210101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Anxiety and depression symptoms of medical staff under COVID-19 epidemic in China","Background It is well known that unexpected pandemic has led to an increase in mental health problems among a variety of populations. Methods In this study, an online non-probability sample survey was used to anonymously investigate the anxiety and depression symptoms among medical staff under the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire included Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Factors associated with anxiety and depression symptoms were estimated by logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 1090 medical staff were investigated in this study. The estimated self-reported rates of anxiety symptoms, depression symptoms and both of the two were 13.3%, 18.4% and 23.9% respectively. Factors associated with self-reported anxiety symptoms include married status (OR=2.3, 95%CI: 1.2, 4.4), not living alone (OR=0.4, 95%CI: 0.2, 0.7), never confiding their troubles to others (OR=2.2, 95%CI: 1.4, 3.5) and higher stress (OR=14.4, 95%CI: 7.8, 26.4). Factors associated with self-reported depression symptoms include not living alone (OR=0.4, 95%CI: 0.3, 0.7), sometimes/often getting care from neighbours (OR=0.6, 95%CI: 0.4, 0.9), never confiding their troubles to others (OR=2.0, 95%CI: 1.3, 3.0) and higher stress (OR=9.7, 95%CI: 6.2, 15.2). Limitations The study was a non-probability sample survey. Besides, scales used in this study can only identify mental health states.

"Depression reported by US adults in 2017–2018 and March and April 2020","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated social distancing and lockdown restrictions are expected to have substantial and enduring mental health effects. In this study, we aimed to assess depression levels before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Methods We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) brief screening instrument to detect probable depression in two nationally representative surveys of US adults. Pre-pandemic levels of depression were assessed in a sample of 5,075 adults from the 2017–2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Depression was assessed in March (N = 6,819) and April 2020 (N = 5,428) in the Understanding America Study, a representative sample of the US population. Results The percentage of US adults with depression increased significantly from 8.7% (95% CI[7.6%–9.8%]) in 2017–2018 to 10.6% (95% CI[9.6%–11.6%) in March 2020 and 14.4% (95% CI[13.1%–15.7%]) in April 2020. Statistically significant increases in depression levels were observed for all population subgroups examined with the exception of those aged 65+ years and Black participants. Young adults (aged 18–34) experienced a marked increase in depression of 13.4 percentage points (95% CI [9.5%–17.2%]) that was larger than any other age group. Additional analyses of depression trends in NHANES from 2007/2008–2017/2018 showed that the substantial increase in depression in April 2020 was unlikely to be due to typical year-to-year variation. Conclusions Our findings suggest that depression levels have risen substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and reinforce recent findings indicating that young adults may be particularly vulnerable to the mental health effects of the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.065","20210101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 and mental health in Brazil: Psychiatric symptoms in the general population","Public health interventions at general population level are imperative in order to decrease the spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but they may contribute to widespread emotional distress and increased risk for psychiatric illnesses. We report on the results of an investigation into the occurrence and determinants of psychiatric symptoms among the Brazilian general population (N = 1996). We assessed sociodemographic variables and general mental health (DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure), depression (PROMIS depression v.8a), anxiety (PROMIS anxiety v.8a), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale-IES-R scale) using an online web-based survey. Anxiety (81.9%), depression (68%), anger (64.5%), somatic symptoms (62.6%) and sleep problems (55.3%) were the most common psychiatric symptoms. Younger age, female gender, low income, lower level of education, longer period of social distancing, and self-reported history of previous psychiatric illness were strongly associated with higher severity of symptoms. Our results support the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of the Brazilian population. The high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms observed in our sample indicates that the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered a public health problem in Brazil.

"What motivates Chinese consumers to avoid information about the COVID-19 pandemic?: The perspective of the stimulus-organism-response model","This study investigated consumers’ information-avoidance behavior in the context of a public health emergency—the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Guided by the stimulus-organism-response paradigm, it proposes a model for exploring the effects of external stimuli (perceived threat and perceived information overload) related to COVID-19 on consumers’ internal states (sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance) and their subsequent behavioral intentions to avoid health information and engage in preventive behaviors. With a survey sample (N = 721), we empirically examined the proposed model and tested the hypotheses. The results indicate that sadness, anxiety, and cognitive dissonance, which were a result of perceived threat and perceived information overload, had heterogeneous effects on information avoidance. Anxiety and cognitive dissonance increased information avoidance intention, while sadness decreased information avoidance intention. Moreover, information avoidance predicted a reluctance on the part of consumers to engage in preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings not only contribute to the information behavior literature and extend the concept of information avoidance to a public health emergency context, but also yield practical insights for global pandemic control.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ipm.2020.102407","20210101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Mental health toll from the coronavirus: Social media usage reveals Wuhan residents’ depression and secondary trauma in the COVID-19 outbreak","This study investigates the possible association between social media usage and the mental health toll from the coronavirus at the peak of Wuhan's COVID-19 outbreak. Informed by the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication Model and Health Belief Model, it proposes a conceptual model to study how people in Wuhan – the first epicenter of the global COVID-19 pandemic – used social media and its effects on users' mental health conditions and health behavior change. The results show that social media usage was related to both depression and secondary trauma, which also predicted health behavior change. But no relation was detected between health behavior change and mental health conditions. As the virus struck, social media usage was rewarding to Wuhan people who gained informational, emotional, and peer support from the health information shared on social media. An excessive use of social media, however, led to mental health issues.

"Depressed, anxious, and stressed: What have healthcare workers on the frontlines in Egypt and Saudi Arabia experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Introduction As the Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) was declared by the world health organization a pandemic in March 2020, thousands of healthcare workers (HCWs) worldwide were on the frontlines fighting against the pandemic. Herein, we selected two Middle East countries; Egypt and Saudi Arabia to investigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on HCWs. Methods In this cross-sectional study, a Google survey was used to access HCWs in many hospitals in Egypt and Saudi Arabia between the 14th and 24th of April 2020. The survey assessed HCWs regarding their sociodemographic and occupational features, sleeping hours, and psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Results This study included 426 HCWs (48.4% physicians, 24.2% nurses, and 27.4% other HCWs). Of them, 69% had depression, 58.9% had anxiety, 55.9% had stress, and 37.3% had inadequate sleeping (<6 hours/day). Female sex, age =30 years, working in Egypt, attending emergency and night shifts, watching/reading COVID-19 news =2 hours/day, and not getting emotional support from family, society, and hospital were associated with a high likelihood of depression, anxiety, stress, and inadequate sleeping.

"Gender as a moderator between Present-Hedonistic time perspective and depressive symptoms or stress during COVID-19 lock-down","Although numerous studies have addressed the impact of the COVID-19 lock-downs on psychological distress, scarce data is available relating to the role of Present-Hedonistic (PH) time perspective and gender differences in the development of depressive symptoms and stress during the period of strict social distancing. We hypothesized that gender would moderate the relationship between PH and depressiveness or stress levels, such that PH would negatively correlate with psychological distress in women but correlate positively in men. The present study was online and questionnaire-based. N = 230 participants aged 15–73 from the general population took part in the study. The results of moderation analysis allowed for full acceptance of the hypothesis for depression as a factor, but for stress the hypothesis was only partially confirmed, since the relationship between PH time perspective and stress was not significant for men (although it was positive, as expected). The findings are pioneering in terms of including PH time perspective in predicting psychological distress during the COVID-19 lock-down and have potentially significant implications for practicing clinicians, who could include the development of more adaptive time perspectives and balance them in their therapeutic work with people experiencing lock-down-related distress.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110395","20210101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Magnetic particle targeting for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers","Over the past decade, the growing interest in targeted lung cancer therapy has guided researchers toward the cutting edge of controlled drug delivery, particularly magnetic particle targeting. Targeting of tissues by magnetic particles has tackled several limitations of traditional drug delivery methods for both cancer detection (e.g., using magnetic resonance imaging) and therapy. Delivery of magnetic particles offers the key advantage of high efficiency in the local deposition of drugs in the target tissue with the least harmful effect on other healthy tissues. This review first overviews clinical aspects of lung morphology and pathogenesis as well as clinical features of lung cancer. It is followed by reviewing the advances in using magnetic particles for diagnosis and therapy of lung cancers: (i) a combination of magnetic particle targeting with MRI imaging for diagnosis and screening of lung cancers, (ii) magnetic drug targeting (MDT) through either intravenous injection and pulmonary delivery for lung cancer therapy, and (iii) computational simulations that models new and effective approaches for magnetic particle drug delivery to the lung, all supporting improved lung cancer treatment. The review further discusses future opportunities to improve the clinical performance of MDT for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and highlights clinical therapy application of the MDT as a new horizon to cure with minimal side effects a wide variety of lung diseases and possibly other acute respiratory syndromes (COVID-19, MERS, and SARS).",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2020.09.017","20201210",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The early impact of COVID-19 on mental health and community physical health services and their patients’ mortality in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK","Background COVID-19 has affected social interaction and healthcare worldwide. Methods We examined changes in presentations and referrals to the primary provider of mental health and community health services in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, UK (population ~0·86 million), plus service activity and deaths. We conducted interrupted time series analyses with respect to the time of UK “lockdown”, which was shortly before the peak of COVID-19 infections in this area. We examined changes in standardized mortality ratio for those with and without severe mental illness (SMI). Results Referrals and presentations to nearly all mental and physical health services dropped at lockdown, with evidence for changes in both supply (service provision) and demand (help-seeking). This was followed by an increase in demand for some services. This pattern was seen for all major forms of presentation to liaison psychiatry services, except for eating disorders, for which there was no evidence of change. Inpatient numbers fell, but new detentions under the Mental Health Act were unchanged. Many services shifted from face-to-face to remote contacts. Excess mortality was primarily in the over-70s. There was a much greater increase in mortality for patients with SMI, which was not explained by ethnicity. Conclusions COVID-19 has been associated with a system-wide drop in the use of mental health services, with some subsequent return in activity. “Supply” changes may have reduced access to mental health services for some. “Demand” changes may reflect a genuine reduction of need or a lack of help-seeking with pent-up demand.

"Suicidal behaviors and ideation during emerging viral disease outbreaks before the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic rapid review","The current COVID-19 pandemic is the most severe pandemic of the 21st century, on track to having a rising death toll. Beyond causing respiratory distress, COVID-19 may also cause mortality by way of suicide. The pathways by which emerging viral disease outbreaks (EVDOs) and suicide are related are complex and not entirely understood. We aimed to systematically review the evidence on the association between EVDOs and suicidal behaviors and/or ideation. An electronic search was conducted using five databases: Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus in April 2020. A rapid systematic review was carried out, which involved separately and independently extracting quantitative data of selected articles. The electronic search yielded 2480 articles, of which 9 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the data were collected in Hong Kong (n = 3) and the USA (n = 3). Four studies reported a slight but significant increase in deaths by suicide during EVDOs. The increase in deaths by suicide was mainly reported during the peak epidemic and in older adults. Psychosocial factors such as the fear of being infected by the virus or social isolation related to quarantine measures were the most prominent factors associated with deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Overall, we found scarce and weak evidence for an increased risk of deaths by suicide during EVDOs. Our results inform the need to orient public health policies toward suicide prevention strategies targeting the psychosocial effects of EVDOs.

"Psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines","Background The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies’ mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. Methods A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. Results The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors’ abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Limitations An English online survey was used. Conclusion During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review","Background As a major virus outbreak in the 21st century, the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to unprecedented hazards to mental health globally. While psychological support is being provided to patients and healthcare workers, the general public's mental health requires significant attention as well. This systematic review aims to synthesize extant literature that reports on the effects of COVID-19 on psychological outcomes of the general population and its associated risk factors. Methods A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus from inception to 17 May 2020 following the PRISMA guidelines. A manual search on Google Scholar was performed to identify additional relevant studies. Articles were selected based on the predetermined eligibility criteria. Results: Relatively high rates of symptoms of anxiety (6.33% to 50.9%), depression (14.6% to 48.3%), post-traumatic stress disorder (7% to 53.8%), psychological distress (34.43% to 38%), and stress (8.1% to 81.9%) are reported in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Spain, Italy, Iran, the US, Turkey, Nepal, and Denmark. Risk factors associated with distress measures include female gender, younger age group (=40 years), presence of chronic/psychiatric illnesses, unemployment, student status, and frequent exposure to social media/news concerning COVID-19. Limitations A significant degree of heterogeneity was noted across studies.

"Revising our attitudes towards agonist medications and their diversion in a time of pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28 days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsat.2020.108139","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and psychological distress symptoms in patients with affective disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to stress worldwide, especially in vulnerable people like those suffering from mental illness. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by a cohort of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD) after a seven-week period of lockdown measures, and to analyze serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels as a potential predictor of distress severity. Methods. Fifty-nine remitted MDD and fifty-three euthymic BD patients were enrolled. An online dedicated survey was administered to obtain lockdown-related information and to evaluate COVID-19 related distress by using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Patients’ medical records were reviewed to collect sociodemographic and clinical data, including serum 25(OH)D levels dosed in the three months preceding the outbreak. A multivariate general linear model was adopted to test the effect of factors of interest on psychological distress. Results. In our sample (n = 112), 29 subjects (25.9 %) reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 35 (31.2 %) and 48 (42.9 %) displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood of psychological distress, respectively. Low serum 25(OH)D levels (p = 0.005) and MDD diagnosis (p = 0.001) specifically predicted the severity of psychological distress. Living alone during the lockdown, a longer duration of illness, and smoking habits were more frequently detected in subjects with COVID-19 related distress. Conclusions. Low serum 25(OH)D levels and MDD diagnosis predicted an increased vulnerability to the stressful impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. Our results suggest that vitamin D may represent a biological factor mediating the psychological response to stress in individuals with affective disorders and provide further insight into tailoring intervention strategies.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2020.104869","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID 19 pandemic: Mental health challenges of internal migrant workers of India","COVID- 19, a biomedical disease has serious physical and tremendous mental health implications as the rapidly spreading pandemic. One of the most vulnerable, but neglected, an occupational community of internal migrant workers is prone for development of psychological ill-effects due to double whammy impact of COVID-19 crisis and concomitant adverse occupational scenario. Permutations and combinations of the factors viz susceptibility for new viral infections, potential to act as vectors of transmission of infection, high prevalence of pre-existing physical health morbidities such as occupational pneumoconiosis, tuberculosis, HIV infections, pre-existing psychological morbidities, adverse psychosocial factors like absence of family support and caretaker during the crisis, their limitations to follow the rules and regulations of personal safety during the COVID 19 crisis, social exclusion, and inability to timely access the psychiatric services; all give rise to the peri-traumatic psychological distress to internal migrant workers. Superadded, is the blow of financial constraints due to loss of work, absence or suspension of occupational safety and health-related basic laws with associated occupational hazards, which make this occupational group highly vulnerable for the development of psychological illnesses. We attempt to draw the attention of mental health professionals, general medical practitioners and occupational health policymakers to the various, interrelated and interdependent predisposing and causative factors for the development of psychological ill-effects amongst internal migrant workers with the interventions needed to address it, from an occupational health perspective angle.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102254","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Alcohol use and mental health status during the first months of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","Background We aimed to estimate the population prevalence of people with changes in their usual patterns of alcohol use during the early stages of the novel coronavirus pandemic of 2020 (COVID-19) pandemic in Australia; assess the association between mental health status and changes in alcohol use during the pandemic; and examine if the associations were modified by gender and age. Methods This study was an anonymously-completed online self-report survey. Changes in alcohol use were assessed using a single fixed-choice study-specific question. Mental health was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale. Results A total of 13,829 people contributed complete data and were included in the analysis. Overall, about one in five adults reported that they had been drinking more alcohol since the COVID-19 pandemic began than they used to. People were more likely to be drinking alcohol more than they used to if they had more severe symptoms of depression or anxiety. The associations between depressive and anxiety symptoms and increased alcohol use since the COVID-19 pandemic began were consistent between females and males. Limitations Online surveys are less accessible to some groups of people. The data are self-report and not diagnostic. Cross-sectional data can identify associations, not causal relationships. The study was limited to participants from Australia.

"Anxiety and depression symptoms, and lack of emotional support among the general population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic A prospective national study on prevalence and risk factors","Background The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and emotional support among the general population are unclear. We therefore assessed if the prevalence of high Anxiety and Depression Symptoms (ADS) levels and lack of Emotional Support (ES) increased, and if risk factors of ADS and ES changed. Methods Data was extracted from surveys conducted with the Dutch longitudinal population-based LISS panel (N = 3,983). ADS and ES were assessed in March 2019 and 2020. Risk factors for ADS and ES were extracted from surveys in November 2018 and 2019. These were: ADS, gender, education, domestic situation, employment, age, ethnicity, lung and heart problems, and diabetes. Results The prevalence of high ADS levels and lack of ES did not increase compared to the pre-outbreak prevalence. ADS, non-native ethnic background, (partial) work disabilities and lung problems were predictive of both ADS and lack of ES in March 2019 and 2020. Job seekers, students and those who take care of housekeeping were more at risk for ADS in March 2020, but not in 2019. While 35–49 years old respondents were less at risk for ADS in March 2019, they were more at risk in 2020. Parents with child(ren) at home and those who take care of housekeeping more often lacked ES in March 2020, but not in 2019. Limitations No other mental health problems were assessed. Conclusions No increase in the prevalence of ADS and lack of ES was found.

"The effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training for improving sleep quality among nursing staff during the COVID-19 outbreak: a before and after study","Objectives Recent studies have demonstrated that first-line nurses involved in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) crisis may experience sleep disturbances. As breathing relaxation techniques can improve sleep quality, anxiety, and depression, the current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of diaphragmatic breathing relaxation training (DBRT) for improving sleep quality among nurses in Wuhan, China during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods This study used a quasi-experimental (before and after) intervention strategy, with 151 first-line nurses from four wards in Leishenshan hospital. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) to evaluate the effectiveness of DBRT before and after the intervention. Data were examined using the Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, and paired t-test. Results A total of 140 nurses completed the DBRT sessions. First-line nurses achieved significant reductions in global sleep quality (p < 0.01), subjective sleep quality (p < 0.001), sleep latency (p < 0.01), sleep duration (p < 0.001), sleep disturbances (p < 0.001), habitual sleep efficiency (p = 0.015), daytime dysfunction (p = 0.001), and anxiety (p = 0.001). There were no significant reductions in the use of sleeping medication (p = 0.134) and depression (p = 0.359).

"Standing up for health – improving mental wellbeing during COVID-19 isolation by reducing sedentary behaviour","The global COVID-19 outbreak and its management are disrupting ways of life and increasing the risk of poor mental and physical health for many. The restrictions on movement have made some forms of physical activity harder to achieve and increased the chances of more sedentary behaviour. Independent of exercise taken, sedentary behaviour can have a negative impact upon mental health, especially by lowering mood. We suggest evidence-based ways of reducing sedentary behaviour with commentary on how they may be adapted for life at home. These include: ways to use external cues, moving more frequently, maximising movement whilst waiting, reallocating time, workstation alternatives, restructuring the physical environment and recruiting help from others. At a time in which our mental and physical health needs are more critical than ever, the relationship between sedentary behaviour and low mood is of particular importance.

"Impact of viral epidemic outbreaks on mental health of healthcare workers: a rapid systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: This study aimed at examining the impact of providing healthcare during health emergencies caused by viral epidemic outbreaks on healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health; to identify factors associated with worse impact, and; to assess the available evidence base regarding interventions to reduce such impact. Method: Rapid systematic review. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO (inception to August 2020). We pooled data using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems, and used GRADE to ascertain the certainty of evidence. Results: We included 117 studies. The pooled prevalence was higher for acute stress disorder (40% (95%CI 39 to 41%)), followed by anxiety (30%, (30 to 31%)), burnout (28% (26 to 31%)), depression (24% (24 to 25%)), and post-traumatic stress disorder (13% (13 to 14%)). We identified factors associated with the likelihood of developing those problems, including sociodemographic (younger age and female gender), social (lack of social support, stigmatization), and occupational (working in a high-risk environment, specific occupational roles, and lower levels of specialised training and job experience) factors. Four studies reported interventions for frontline HCW: two educational interventions increased confidence in pandemic self-efficacy and in interpersonal problems solving (very low certainty), whereas one multifaceted intervention improved anxiety, depression, and sleep quality (very low certainty). Limitations: We only searched three databases, and the initial screening was undertaken by a single reviewer. Conclusion: Given the very limited evidence regarding the impact of interventions to tackle mental health problems in HCWs, the risk factors identified represent important targets for future interventions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.034","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Anxiety disorders, climate change, and the challenges ahead: Introduction to the special issue","Climate change involves (1) increases in the prevalence of extreme weather events (e.g., wildfires, floods, hurricanes), (2) more gradual climatic changes (e.g., rising sea levels, desertification), and (3) increased risks of pandemics and other widespread disease outbreaks. Anxiety evoked by the threat of climate change can be either adaptive or maladaptive. Adaptive anxiety can motivate climate activism, such as efforts to reduce one’s carbon footprint. Maladaptive anxiety can take the form of anxious passivity, where the person feels anxious but incapable of addressing the problem of climate change, and may take the form of an anxiety disorder triggered or exacerbated by climatic stressors. Such stressors may involve exposure to extreme weather events or may involve exposure to other stressors such as forced migration due to rising sea levels or desertification. Three types of interventions are needed to address the various types of climate-related anxiety: (1) programs that motivate people to overcome anxious passivity and thereby take action to mitigate the effects of climate change, (2) treatment programs that address anxiety associated with exposure to climatic stressors, and (3) programs that build resilience at an individual and community level, to help people better cope with the challenges ahead.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102313","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain","Background Strict confinement and social distancing measures have been imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in many countries. The aim was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys, separated by one month, performed in Spain. Methods Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. Results There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales, and daily physical activity to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Conclusions Results indicated a temporal increase of anxiety, depression and stress scores during the COVID-19 lockdown. Factors such as age, consumption of information about COVID-19 and physical activity seem to have an important impact on the evolution of psychological symptoms.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.018","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A framework for identifying and mitigating the equity harms of COVID-19 policy interventions","Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Governments have implemented combinations of “lockdown” measures of various stringencies, including school and workplace closures, cancellations of public events, and restrictions on internal and external movements. These policy interventions are an attempt to shield high-risk individuals and to prevent overwhelming countries' healthcare systems, or, colloquially, “flatten the curve.” However, these policy interventions may come with physical and psychological health harms, group and social harms, and opportunity costs. These policies may particularly affect vulnerable populations and not only exacerbate pre-existing inequities but also generate new ones. Methods We developed a conceptual framework to identify and categorize adverse effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures. We based our framework on Lorenc and Oliver's framework for the adverse effects of public health interventions and the PROGRESS-Plus equity framework. To test its application, we purposively sampled COVID-19 policy examples from around the world and evaluated them for the potential physical, psychological, and social harms, as well as opportunity costs, in each of the PROGRESS-Plus equity domains: Place of residence, Race/ethnicity, Occupation, Gender/sex, Religion, Education, Socioeconomic status, Social capital, Plus (age, and disability). Results We found examples of inequitably distributed adverse effects for each COVID-19 lockdown policy example, stratified by a low- or middle-income country and high-income country, in every PROGRESS-Plus equity domain. We identified the known policy interventions intended to mitigate some of these adverse effects. The same harms (anxiety, depression, food insecurity, loneliness, stigma, violence) appear to be repeated across many groups and are exacerbated by several COVID-19 policy interventions. Conclusion Our conceptual framework highlights the fact that COVID-19 policy interventions can generate or exacerbate interactive and multiplicative equity harms. Applying this framework can help in three ways: (1) identifying the areas where a policy intervention may generate inequitable adverse effects; (2) mitigating the policy and practice interventions by facilitating the systematic examination of relevant evidence; and (3) planning for lifting COVID-19 lockdowns and policy interventions around the world.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.004","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"How is COVID-19 pandemic impacting mental health of children and adolescents?","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) affected virtually all countries. Uncertain about the health risk and an increasing financial loss will contribute to widespread emotional distress and an increased risk of psychiatric disorders shortly. Posttraumatic, anxiety, and depression disorders are expected during and aftermath of the pandemic. Some groups, like children, have more susceptibility to having long term consequences in mental health. Herein, we made a comprehensive and non-systematic search in four databases (PubMed, Scopus, SciELO, and Google Scholars) to answer the question: What are children's and adolescents' mental health effects of the pandemic? Furthermore, which features are essential for mental health in a pandemic? Results: Seventy-seven articles were selected for full text read, and 51 were included. Children answer stress differently, depending on the development stage. High rates of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms were identified among children. Discussion: Symptoms were as expected. New supportive strategies have appeared during this pandemic, but there is no measure of its effectiveness. Some groups seem to be more vulnerable to the mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the mitigation actions should prioritize them. The school's role appears to be revalued by society. This review seems to pick good targets to prioritize mitigation actions aiming to spare children not only from the severe cases of COVID-19 but also to help them to deal with the mental health burden of the pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2020.101845","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Public mental health under the long-term influence of COVID-19 in China: Geographical and temporal distribution","Background The mental health status caused by major epidemics is serious and lasting. At present, there are few studies about the lasting mental health effects of COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the mental health of the Chinese public during the long-term COVID-19 outbreak. Methods A total of 1172 online questionnaires were collected, covering demographical information and 8 common psychological states: depression, anxiety, somatization, stress, psychological resilience, suicidal ideation and behavior, insomnia, and stress disorder. In addition, the geographical and temporal distributions of different mental states were plotted. Results Overall, 30.1% of smokers increased smoking, while 11.3% of drinkers increased alcohol consumption. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety, mental health problems, high risk of suicidal and behavior, clinical insomnia, clinical post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, moderate-to-high levels of perceived stress were 18.8%, 13.3%, 7.6%, 2.8%, 7.2%, 7.0%, and 67.9%, respectively. Further, the geographical distribution showed that the mental status in some provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities was relatively more serious. The temporal distribution showed that the psychological state of the participants was relatively poorer on February 20, 24 to 26 and March 25, especially on March 25. Limitations This cross-sectional design cannot make causal inferences. The snowball sampling was not representative enough. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the prevalence rate of mental disorders in the Chinese public is relatively low in the second month of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Nurses endured high risks of psychological problems under the epidemic of COVID-19 in a longitudinal study in Wuhan China","Background Health care workers, especially frontline nurses, faced great challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Aims To assess the magnitude of the psychological status and associated risk factors among nurses in the pandemic center in Wuhan, China. Methods In this study, we enrolled nurses from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University. The questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of the participants, and included four psychological assessment scales. We issued the questionnaires at two different points of time. We conducted the first survey on January 29 to February 2 (outbreak period) with 709 eligible responses, and the second survey on February 26 to February 28 (stable period) with 621 eligible responses. The nurses from Wuchang Fangcang shelter hospital were also enrolled in the second survey. Results During the pandemic, over one-third of nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and insomnia. In the outbreak period, the nurses showed significantly higher risks for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than those in the stable period (P < 0.01). Notably, the nurses from the Fangcang shelter hospitals were more likely to present psychological problems than those from other frontline or non-frontline (all P < 0.001) units, especially for insomnia (38.3% with severe insomnia). The nurses from the frontline, with worse physical condition and uncertain concerns about this pandemic as compared to the others, were more likely to bear psychological problems. Thus, online psychological information and sufficient protection conditions were effective interventions to help mitigate psychological distress. The nurses from Fangcang shelter hospitals suffered a significantly higher risk of psychological problems than those from other units. Conclusion The psychological status of nurses needs more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who fought in the frontline during the peak of the outbreak.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.007","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The relationship between air pollution and COVID-19-related deaths: An application to three French cities","Being heavily dependent to oil products (mainly gasoline and diesel), the French transport sector is the main emitter of Particulate Matter (PMs) whose critical levels induce harmful health effects for urban inhabitants. We selected three major French cities (Paris, Lyon, and Marseille) to investigate the relationship between the Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) outbreak and air pollution. Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) experiments, we have determined the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 linked to COVID-19-related deaths. Our focus is on the potential effects of Particulate Matter (PM) in spreading the epidemic. The underlying hypothesis is that a pre-determined particulate concentration can foster COVID-19 and make the respiratory system more susceptible to this infection. The empirical strategy used an innovative Machine Learning (ML) methodology. In particular, through the so-called cutting technique in ANNs, we found new threshold levels of PM2.5 and PM10 connected to COVID-19: 17.4 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 29.6 µg/m3 (PM10) for Paris; 15.6 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 20.6 µg/m3 (PM10) for Lyon; 14.3 µg/m3 (PM2.5) and 22.04 µg/m3 (PM10) for Marseille. Interestingly, all the threshold values identified by the ANNs are higher than the limits imposed by the European Parliament. Finally, a Causal Direction from Dependency (D2C) algorithm is applied to check the consistency of our findings.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115835","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health &amp; wellbeing among home-quarantined Bangladeshi students: A cross-sectional pilot study","Background COVID-19 is imposing threat both on physical and mental health since its outbreak. Bangladesh adopted lockdown strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, mental and physical health and this study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on mental health and wellbeing among Bangladeshi students. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted between 9th and 23rd April 2020 among 505 college and university students. Data was collected by using online questionnaire including DASS 21 and IES. Descriptive analysis and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. Results 28.5 % of the respondents had stress, 33.3% anxiety, 46.92% depression from mild to extremely severe, according to DASS 21 and 69.31% had event-specific distress from mild to severe in terms of severity according to IES. Perceiving physical symptoms as COVID-19 was significantly associated with DASS stress subscale (B = 3.71, 95% CI: 1.01 to 6.40), DASS anxiety subscale (B = 3.95, 95% CI: 1.95 to 5.96), DASS depression subscale (B = 3.82, 95% CI: 0.97 to 6.67) and IES scale (B = 7.52, 95% CI: 3.58 to 11.45). Additionally, fear of infection, financial uncertainty, inadequate food supply, absence of physical exercise and limited or no recreational activity had significant association with stress, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic symptoms.

"Psychological distress associated with COVID-19 quarantine: Latent profile analysis, outcome prediction and mediation analysis","Background Mental health of the population during COVID-19 quarantine could be at risk. Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. Methods Online cross-sectional data (n = 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study (n = 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). Results Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. Conclusions Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress.

"The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures: Experience from 4000 participants","Background In February 2020 the first cases of COVID-19 were identified in Kuwait. Inevitably as many countries worldwide, the general public were negatively affected by the pandemic. Unemployment, uncertainty, distress, increasing deaths, lockdown measures all of which are potential burdens on mental health. Aim To assess the impact of COVID19 outbreak on mental health in Kuwait, and to explore the potential influencing risk factors. Methods We conducted an online questionnaire-based study in Kuwait between 25th May 2020 to 30th May 2020. Questions were based on demographics, lifestyle during outbreak, depression and anxiety assessment. Total PHQ9 and GAD7 scores were calculated for each responder. Results We had 4132 responders. Most were females (69.31%), married (59.37%), between the age of 21-30 (23.84%) and non-smokers (81.46%). Only (7.96%) had a positive past psychiatric history, (32.04%) had a past history of a chronic medical disease. During the outbreak most of the responders lost their jobs (39.21%) and only (12.83%) were attending work regularly, only (6.82%) worked in the healthcare sector. 59.27% report increased social media use compared to before the lockdown.

"Psychological distress related to COVID-19 – The contribution of continuous traumatic stress","Objective The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is a substantial stressor that could eventuate in psychological distress. Evidence suggests that individuals previously exposed to traumatic events, and particularly to continuous traumatic stress (CTS), might be more vulnerable to distress when facing additional stressors. This study aimed to investigate these suppositions in the context of the ongoing shelling of Israel from the Israel-Gaza border, which continues even amidst the COVID-19 crisis. Method An online survey was conducted among Israel's general population. The sample included 976 participants. Seven-hundred-and-ninety-three participants had been exposed to traumatic events, with 255 participants reporting CTS. Trauma exposure, COVID-19-related stressors, and psychological distress related to COVID-19 (anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms) were assessed. Results Most participants reported experiencing at least one psychiatric symptom related to COVID-19. Being younger, female, not in a relationship, having a below-average income, being diagnosed with the disease, living alone during the outbreak, having a close other in a high-risk group, and negatively self-rating one's health status were associated with elevated distress. Individuals who had been exposed to trauma, and to CTS in particular, had elevated anxiety, depression, and peritraumatic stress symptoms compared to individuals without such a history or to survivors of non-ongoing traumatic events. CTS moderated the relations between PTSD symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and peritraumatic stress symptoms, with significantly stronger relations found among individuals exposed to CTS. Limitations This study relied on convenience sampling. Conclusions Trauma survivors, and particularly traumatized individuals exposed to CTS, seem at risk for psychological distress related to COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.141","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff in china under the COVID-19 epidemic: Workload should be concerned","Background To our best knowledge, this was the first time to investigate the prevalence and risk factors of psychological disturbances, including depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia and suicide, among frontline medical staff, who were working with the COVID-10 infected patients directly. Methods Patient Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire scale (GAD-7), Symptom Check List-90 (SCL-90) somatization, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and the suicidal module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview were used for online survey. Results A total of 606 frontline hospital staff and1099 general population were recruited. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms, insomnia, and suicide risk in frontline medical staffs were 57.6%, 45.4%, 12.0%, 32.0% and 13.0%, respectively. Except for suicide risk, the prevalence of other psychological disorders in frontline medical staff were higher than those in general population (all p<0.01). Among the frontline medical staff, the daily working hours were associated with all psychological disturbance (all p<0.01), women with anxiety (p = 0.02), body mass index (BMI) with anxiety and insomnia (p = 0.02, p = 0.03). Age was negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and insomnia (all p<0.01). Finally, years of working and family income were negatively associated with suicide risk (p = 0.03, p<0.001). Conclusion Our study demonstrates that during the outbreak of COVID-19, the frontline medical staff are more likely to suffer from psychological disturbances than general population. It is noticeable that daily working hours are a risk factor for all measured psychological disturbances, and some other variables may be involved in certain psychological disturbances of frontline medical staff.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.059","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Elevated depression and anxiety symptoms among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Anxiety and depression symptoms in pregnancy typically affect between 10 and 25% of pregnant individuals. Elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety are associated with increased risk of preterm birth, postpartum depression, and behavioural difficulties in children. The current COVID-19 pandemic is a unique stressor with potentially wide-ranging consequences for pregnancy and beyond. Methods We assessed symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the current COVID-19 pandemic and determined factors that were associated with psychological distress. 1987 pregnant participants in Canada were surveyed in April 2020. The assessment included questions about COVID-19-related stress and standardized measures of depression, anxiety, pregnancy-related anxiety, and social support. Results We found substantially elevated anxiety and depression symptoms compared to similar pre-pandemic pregnancy cohorts, with 37% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of depression and 57% reporting clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety. Higher symptoms of depression and anxiety were associated with more concern about threats of COVID-19 to the life of the mother and baby, as well as concerns about not getting the necessary prenatal care, relationship strain, and social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher levels of perceived social support and support effectiveness, as well as more physical activity, were associated with lower psychological symptoms. Conclusion This study shows concerningly elevated symptoms of anxiety and depression among pregnant individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, that may have long-term impacts on their children. Potential protective factors include increased social support and exercise, as these were associated with lower symptoms and thus may help mitigate long-term negative outcomes.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.126","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms, and association with epidemic-related factors during the epidemic period of COVID-19 among 123,768 workers in China: A large cross-sectional study","Background COVID-19 has gained intense attention globally. However, little is known about the COVID-19-ralated mental health status among workers. Methods The cross-sectional online survey with 123,768 workers was conducted from February 2, 2020 to February 7, 2020 on a mega-size labor-intensive factory in Shenzhen, China. Oral consent was obtained prior to the questionnaire survey. The information collected in the survey included demographic characteristics, psychological symptoms, COVID-19-related information, and demands for psychological education and interventions. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured by the Zung's Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Self-Rating Depression Scale. Logistic regression models were performed to determine the association between related factors and mental health status. Results The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms was 3.4% and 22.8%, respectively. The dominant epidemic-related factors were having confirmed cases in the community (odds ratio [OR], 2.75, 95% CI, 2.37–3.19) and having confirmed friends (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.69–3.52) for the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. Nevertheless, major traditional risk factors such as general or poor health status and always drinking alcohol were still the dominant factors associated with the increased risk of anxiety and depression symptoms. Overall, 67.3% and 26.8% workers reported desire for psychological education and interventions, respectively. Limitations All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias.

"The first COVID-19 infanticide-suicide case: Financial crisis and fear of COVID-19 infection are the causative factors","Background The global suicide occurrences have been aggravated because of COVID-19 crisis-related issues such as fear of infection, the financial crisis, being infected with COVID-19, loneliness, social boycott, etc. Although two studies reported about the seven dyadic suicidality cases (i.e., suicide pacts), child homicide-suicide has not been studied. Case presentation On 14 May, two dead bodies (i.e., a 30-years old Indian woman and her six-month-old baby) were found in a Riyadh apartment complex. The perpetrator (a person who kills the others and later commits suicide) – a trained nurse, was in search of a job. The woman's husband was recently retrenched from his technician job at a company in Madinah Airport. Her husband was admitted to a hospital with symptoms related to the COVID-19 infection four days before the suicide incidence. The 70-year-old mother-in-law alerted the neighbors after finding that the apartment is locked from inside and there was no response on knocking the doors. After this, the neighbors gathered and called the police. Police found two dead-bodies after opening the flat and suspected that the child was killed before the woman committed suicide. Conclusions Based on the present findings, further child filicide-suicide possibilities in families with economically distressed and/or positive COVID-19 status are expected. Hence, proper financial supports, providing authentic information (COVID-19), and mental health promotional strategies are suggested for decreasing incidences of COVID-19 related infanticide-suicide cases.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102365","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the long period of mandatory social isolation that took place in Argentina on the general psychological well-being of healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A survey was conducted during June 2020, in healthcare workers. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Sleepiness-Wakefulness Inability and Fatigue Test, and Goldberg depression and anxiety scale, were used to analyze the effects of the SARS-Cov 2 outbreak after three months of mandatory social isolation. Analyses were performed by logistic regression and a clustering algorithm in order to classify subjects in the function of their outcome's severity. Results From 1059 surveys, the majority reported symptoms of depression (81.0%), anxiety (76.5%), poor sleep quality (84.7%), and insomnia (73.7%) with 58.9% suffering from nightmares. Logistic regression showed that being in contact with COVID-19 patients, age, gender and the consumption of sleep medication during the mandatory social isolation were relevant predictors for insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Clustering analysis classified healthcare workers in three groups with healthy/mild, moderate, and severe outcomes. The most vulnerable group was composed mainly of younger people, female, non-medical staff, or physicians in training. Conclusion An extremely high proportion of Argentinian healthcare workers suffered from sleep problems, anxiety, and depression symptoms. The clustering algorithm successfully separates vulnerable from non-vulnerable populations suggesting the need to carry out future studies involving resilience and vulnerability factors.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.09.022","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"From the perspective of Traditional Chinese Medicine: Treatment of mental disorders in COVID-19 survivors","Purpose The aim of this study is to explore the possible benefits of traditional Chinese medicine on the pathogenesis of psychological and mental health of COVID-19 survivors. Methods A literature search was conducted to confirm the effects of COVID-19 on psychological and mental health of survivors. In addition to this, on the basis of signs and symptoms, TCM were used on treat mental disorder as per suggested clinical and animal experimental data plus relevant records in classical Chinese medicine books written by Zhang Zhongiing during Han Dynasty. A series of treatment plans were prescribed for COVID-19 survivors with psychological and mental disorders. Results According to previous extensive studies focusing on effects on mental health of survivors, high incidence was observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) survivors. During investigations of mental health of COVID-19 patients and survivors, it is observed that they also had symptoms of mental disorders and immune dysfunction. Furthermore, it was also proposed that depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were most common mental disorders requiring special attention after the recovery from COVID-19. The symptoms of COVID-19 were analyzed, and the TCM syndrome of the depression, anxiety and PTSD after recovered from COVID19 was interpreted as internal heat and Yin deficiency. These three mental disorders pertains the category of “Lily disease”, “hysteria” and “deficient dysphoria” in TCM. Conclusion Lily Bulb, Rhizoma Anemarrhena Decoction and Ganmai Dazao Decoction were used to treat depression. Suanzaoren Decoction, Huanglian Ejiao Decoction and Zhizi Chi Decoction were suggested for anxiety. Moreover, Lily Bulb, Rehmannia Decoction and Guilu Erxian Decoction were the formula for PTSD.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.biopha.2020.110810","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Validation of the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaires for Chronic Medical Conditions: A Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Cohort study","Objective Fear associated with medical vulnerability should be considered when assessing mental health among individuals with chronic medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions. Methods Fifteen initial items were generated based on suggestions from 121 people with the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). Patients in a COVID-19 SSc cohort completed items between April 9 and 27, 2020. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and item analysis were used to select items for inclusion. Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate internal consistency reliability and convergent validity. Factor structure was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in follow-up data collection two weeks later. Results 787 participants completed baseline measures; 563 of them completed the follow-up assessment. Ten of 15 initial items were included in the final questionnaire. EFA suggested that a single dimension explained the data reasonably well. There were no indications of floor or ceiling effects. Cronbach's alpha was 0.91. Correlations between the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire and measures of anxiety (r = 0.53), depressive symptoms (r = 0.44), and perceived stress (r = 0.50) supported construct validity. CFA supported the single-factor structure (<U+03C7>2(35) = 311.2, p < 0.001, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.97, Comparative Fit Index = 0.96, Root Mean Square Error of Approximation = 0.12).

"The mediation role of sleep quality in the association between the incidence of unhealthy movement behaviors during the COVID-19 quarantine and mental health","Background Our aim was to investigate the mediating role of worsening sleep quality in the association of the incidence of physical inactivity, high TV-viewing, and high computer/tablet use with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety. Methods Data of 45,161 Brazilian adults from a nationwide behavior survey, conducted between April 24th and May 24th (2020), were used. Participants reported physical inactivity (PI; <150 min/week), high TV-viewing (TV; =4 h/day), and high computer/tablet use (PC; =4 h/day) before and during COVID-19 quarantine (exposures). For incidence indicators, we only considered participants without the risk behavior before quarantine. Changes in sleep quality during the quarantine period (maintained/got better or worsened) were treated as a mediator. Elevated frequencies of feelings of loneliness, sadness (feel sad, crestfallen, or depressed), and anxiety (feel worried, anxious, or nervous) during the pandemic period were the study outcomes. Analyses were adjusted for sex, age group, highest academic achievement, working status during quarantine, skin color, previous diagnosis of depression, and adherence to quarantine. Mediation models were created using the Karlson Holm Breen method. Results The incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use were associated with loneliness, sadness, and anxiety feelings. Worsening sleep quality partly mediated the association of the incidence of PI, high TV, and high PC use with loneliness (PI:30.9%; TV:19.6%; PC: 30.5%), sadness (PI:29.8%; TV:29.3%; PC: 39.1%), and anxiety (PI:21.9%; TV:30.0%; PC:38.5%).

"Addressing opioid overdose deaths: The vision for the HEALing communities study","The United States is facing two devastating public health crises– the opioid epidemic and the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this context, one of the most ambitious implementation studies in addiction research is moving forward. Launched in May 2019, the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) was developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) as part of the Helping to End Addiction Long-termSM Initiative (National Institutes of Health, 2020). The goal for this research was to reduce opioid overdose deaths by 40 % in three years by enhancing and integrating the delivery of multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) with proven effectiveness in reducing opioid overdose deaths across health care, justice, and community settings. This paper describes the initial vision, goals, and objectives of this initiative; the impact of COVID-19; and the potential for knowledge to be generated from HCS at the intersection of an unrelenting epidemic of opioid misuse and overdoses and the ravishing COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108329","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Optimism-pessimism, conspiracy theories and general trust as factors contributing to COVID-19 related behavior – A cross-cultural study","The main aim of this research was to examine the role of optimism-pessimism, general trust and belief in conspiracy theories, in COVID-19 related fears, preventive and hoarding behaviors. We also examined the role of different sources of information in these relations. The convenience sample was used (N = 412) and it consisted of individuals from Serbia (N = 292) and Latin-America (N = 120). Following instruments were used: The Life Orientation Test (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994), Trust in people scale (Arbor, 1964), questions regarding fear, source of information, preventive behaviors and conspiracy constructed for the purposes of this research. The results suggest that fear of food shortage was the most pronounces one in both samples, followed by fear for oneself and finally by the fear for beloved others. Results suggest that optimists, those with high level of general trust and those who do not believe in conspiracy theories show lower level of fear and higher level of preventive behaviors. Pessimists on the other hand, show higher level of fear. Fear was related to all information sources suggesting that more information leads to higher intensity of fear – except information from the president which did not show any effect.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110216","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Knowledge, attitudes and mental health of university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Background Little is known about the psychological impact of COVID-19 on university students during the disease outbreak in China, but this information is important for the development of services to support these students who are typically in their early 20s. Thus, the aim of this study was to examine university students' knowledge, attitudes, and mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods On February 10, 2020 and during the second week of national lockdown, 511 students from a university in China were assessed using the COVID-19 General Information Questionnaire and the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) questionnaire. To understand the mental health status of the current sample, we compared it with the normal population. Results Four hundred and seventy-two valid questionnaires were collected. In total, 11% of respondents reported confirmed COVID-19 cases in their hometowns or communities. In view of students' knowledge about COVID-19, 56% had sufficient knowledge of typical symptoms of COVID-19, and 41% knew a lot about prevention methods for the future pandemic. In terms of the risk perceptions, 57% had experienced considerable fear of this disease, and 19% perceived a high risk of becoming infected. In terms of attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, 63% felt positive about its development (i.e., it was generally under control), and 92% declared that they were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The scores for somatization, obsessive-compulsive disorder, interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and the general severity index were significantly increased compared with the norm (p < 0.001). However, no differences in the scores for depression, hostility and psychoticism were noted (p > 0.05). Conclusion University students possessed insufficient COVID-19 knowledge and high-risk perceptions. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the mental health of university students. Social support and targeted interventions tailored to university students should be provided during such an outbreak, and university administration should strengthen the cultivation of students' mental toughness using standard teaching processes.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105494","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Objective To compare anxiety and depression symptoms among people with a pre-existing medical condition and factors associated with changes. Methods Pre-COVID-19 Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network Cohort data were linked to COVID-19 data from April 2020. Multiple linear and logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with continuous change and = 1 minimal clinically important difference (MCID) change for anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0; MCID = 4.0) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-8; MCID = 3.0) symptoms, controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels. Results Mean anxiety symptoms increased 4.9 points (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.0 to 5.7). Depression symptom change was negligible (0.3 points; 95% CI -0.7 to 0.2). Compared to France (N = 159), adjusted anxiety symptom change scores were significantly higher in the United Kingdom (N = 50; 3.3 points, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.6), United States (N = 128; 2.5 points, 95% CI 0.7 to 4.2), and Canada (N = 98; 1.9 points, 95% CI 0.1 to 3.8). Odds of =1 MCID increase were 2.6 for the United Kingdom (95% CI 1.2 to 5.7) but not significant for the United States (1.6, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.9) or Canada (1.4, 95% CI 0.7 to 2.5).

"Impact of COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and perceived strain among caregivers tending children with special needs","Background While COVID-19 outbreak has had adverse psychological effects in children with special needs, the mental state and burden on their caregivers during this pandemic has yet to be reported. Aims The objectives of this study were to describe the mental health status and the change in perceived strain among caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods and procedures Two hundred sixty four caregivers completed an online survey that assessed demographics, use and perspective on tele-rehabilitation, homecare therapy, caregiver’s strain and mental health. Outcomes and results The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms were found to be 62.5 %, 20.5 % and 36.4 % respectively. A significant difference in caregiver strain (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.93) was observed during the outbreak compared to levels pre-outbreak (pre-outbreak strain was measured retrospectively). Caregivers not using tele-rehabilitation along with a perception of it being a poor medium for rehabilitation were at greater risks for poor mental health whereas a negative perception on homecare therapy were strongly associated with higher psychological symptoms and strain. Conclusions and implications This study identified a high prevalence of depression and significant change in strain displayed by caregivers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We identified several factors associated with poor mental health and perceived strain that can be used to help safeguard caregivers.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2020.103790","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Historical trauma and social support as predictors of psychological stress responses in American Indian adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background American Indians (AIs) live with historical trauma, or the cumulative emotional and psychological wounding that is passed from one generation to the next in response to the loss of lives and culture. Psychological consequences of historical trauma may contribute to health disparities. Purpose Here, we investigate whether historical trauma predicts changes in psychological stress associated with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in AI adults. Based on the stress-sensitization theory, we hypothesize that greater historical trauma will predict greater increases in levels of psychological stress from before the onset of the pandemic to after. Method: Our analytic sample consisted of 205 AI adults. We measured historical trauma and levels of psychological stress before and after the onset of the pandemic. Results Using hierarchical regression models controlling for age, biological sex, income, symptoms of depression and anxiety, psychological stress at Time 1, COVID-19 specific stress, and childhood trauma, we found that greater historical trauma preceding the pandemic predicted greater increases in psychological stress (ß = 0.38, t = 5.17 p < .01, <U+0394>R2 = 0.12), and levels of social support interacted with historical trauma to predict changes in psychological stress (ß = -0.19, t = -3.34, p = .001, <U+0394>R2 = 0.04). The relationship between historical trauma and changes in stress was significant for individuals with low levels of social support. Conclusions Historical trauma may contribute to AI mental health disparities, through heightened psychological stress responses to life stressors and social support appears to moderate this relationship.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110263","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The prevalence and risk factors of PTSD symptoms among medical assistance workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background The outbreak of COVID 19 in December 2019 spread quickly and overwhelmed the local healthcare system of the epicenter. A total of 346 medical assistance teams with 42,600 reserve medics were mobilized from around the country for emergency assistance. This study aims to examine the incidence of mental health symptoms and predictors of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders (PTSD) symptoms among the reserve medics working in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province. Methods An anonymous survey was conducted from April 4–6, 2020 among the medics upon their returning home. A total of 225 surveys were returned with a response rate of 83%. The survey consisted of questionnaires about the medics' demographic information, social relations, mental health status (e.g. IES-R and DASS-21) and other work-related information. Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal-Wallis Test and hierarchical logistic regression models were used to examine the predictors of PTSD symptoms. Results During the stay in Wuhan, the medics experienced high levels of depression (46.7%), anxiety (35.6%) and stress symptoms (16.0%). Upon returning home, the overall prevalence of clinically concerned PTSD symptoms was as high as 31.6%. Further analyses revealed that PTSD symptoms and its subscales were significantly associated with age, collegial relationship and mental health status during their service. Conclusion The reserve medics reported a high prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress as well as clinically concerned PTSD symptoms.

"Dying alone and lonely dying: Media discourse and pandemic conditions","Background and objectives This paper explores current concerns and practice related to older people dying alone in Intensive Care Units, care homes, and at home through media discussions during the Covid-19 pandemic and before. It addresses the historically-situated concept of a good death and a bad death and suggests why dying alone, whether completely alone or without significant others physically present, may be considered a bad death. Methods As evidence for collective fears about dying alone, we explored the treatment of these deaths in media using headline examples from the US New York Times and the English Guardian newspaper from the 19th century through Sept. 2020. Results A search of the New York Times located 39 articles with either lonely dying or lonely death in the headline. The Guardian had 25 articles with use of the term, but unlike the New York Times, no obituaries were included. Although the deaths profiled were deemed unusual, deaths by suicide were only minimally classed as dying alone. The condition of dying alone is represented as a stigmatised death. Themes addressed: 1) dying alone is a nonnormative event; 2) this death matters; and 3) where people die alone, societies should honour the death and learn from it. Discussion and implications Contemporary dying involves conditions for which we are unprepared as a society. We seldom address our civic obligations to each other. Few people have discussed their wishes about their preferences in dying and whether and how they want to be accompanied at their death, if possible. This is an invisible constraint of modern healthcare. Because of limited discussions and preparation, these deaths may lead to disenfranchised grief for the mourners. Cultural and societal responses to lonely dying are important in easing the emotional burden of dying alone, helping individuals prepare for this possibility and better integrating death with the life course. Recommendations include inclusion of accompaniment/nonaccompaniment at death as part of advance care planning and mitigation if this condition occurs. It is essential for individuals to find their own still point of acceptance within competing societal narratives of privileging the self in dying alone and the value of social connection.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaging.2020.100878","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Introduction to the special issue on the HEALing Communities Study","The severity of the overdose epidemic underscores the urgent need for innovative and high impact interventions that promote the rapid penetration and scale up of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in communities profoundly affected by fatal opioid overdose. This special issue shares scientific advancements in implementation research design and evaluation of a novel data-driven community-based intervention. The HEALing (Helping End Addiction Long-Term) Communities Study (HCS) is a four-year study that is designed to examine the effectiveness of the Communities That HEAL (CTH) intervention. The CTH intervention supports the dissemination of EBPs in 67 communities across four high-burdened states—Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. The diversity in these communities in terms of rural-urban status, race-ethnicity and other social determinants of health facilitates generalizability of results to other communities across the US. The nine papers in this special issue describe critical elements that constitute the HCS framework and design. This includes the implementation of EBPs that have a substantial impact on fatal and non-fatal opioid overdose, the Opioid-overdose Reduction Continuum of Care Approach, communication campaigns to increase awareness and demand for EBPs and reduce stigma against people with OUD and MOUD interventions, and the process of community engagement. This includes how to form community coalitions and gain their commitment, and steps taken to mobilize coalitions to pursue EBP implementation and ensure EBPs are adapted for community needs. The collective papers in this issue demonstrate that the design of any complex study must adapt to unanticipated temporal events, including the rapidly emerging COVID-19 crisis. Readers will learn about the scientific process of the design and implementation of a community-engaged intervention, its methodologies, guiding conceptual models, and research implementation strategies that can be applied to address other health issues.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108327","20201201",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The psychological status of 8817 hospital workers during COVID-19 Epidemic: A cross-sectional study in Chongqing","Background There was an outbreak of COVID-19 towards the end of 2019 in China, which spread all over the world rapidly. The Chinese healthcare system is facing a big challenge where hospital workers are experiencing enormous psychological pressure. This study aimed to (1) investigate the psychological status of hospital workers and (2) provide references for psychological crisis intervention in the future. Method An online survey was conducted to collect sociodemographic features, epidemic-related factors, results of PHQ-9, GAD-7, PHQ-15, suicidal and self-harm ideation (SSI), and the score of stress and support scales. Chi-square test, t-test, non-parametric, and logistic regression analysis were used to detect the risk factors to psychological effect and SSI. Results 8817 hospital workers participated in this online survey. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and SSI were 30.2%, 20.7%, 46.2%, and 6.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that female, single, Tujia minority, educational background of junior or below, designated or county hospital, need for psychological assistance before or during the epidemic, unconfident about defeating COVID-19, ignorance about the epidemic, willingness of attending parties, and poor self-rated health condition were independent factors associated with high-level depression, somatic symptom, and SSI among hospital workers (P<0.05). Limitations This cross-sectional study cannot reveal the causality, and voluntary participation could be prone to selection bias. A modified epidemic-related stress and support scale without standardization was used. The number of hospital workers in each hospital was unavailable. Conclusion There were a high level of psychological impact and SSI among hospital workers, which needed to be addressed. County hospital workers were more severe and easier to be neglected.

"The possible immunoregulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in coronavirus disease patients","While researchers are struggling to develop a vaccine for coronavirus disease, it is important to evolve effective therapeutic strategies to save lives. The majority of coronavirus disease deaths are due to pneumonia. Mostly, stress and depression are associated with coronavirus disease infection and thus, resulting in weakening of patients’ immune response and hence, more severe respiratory symptoms or even death. We propose using a class of antidepressants named selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for their reported potential antiviral effect, modulatory effect of respiratory symptoms, antioxidant properties and immunoregulatory effects beside their main action as antidepressant. In addition, the low cost of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors might add a benefit for coronavirus disease patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110140","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Methods We conducted a quantitative study, which included 119 Chinese PD patients who had been treated in an outpatient neurology clinic in Wuhan and 169 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The questionnaire survey focused on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, mental status, symptoms, and daily life and medical treatment of PD patients. Results Compared to healthy controls, PD patients had significantly higher scores in both the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (8.13 vs 5.36, p < 0.001) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -Depression (4.89 vs 3.82, p = 0.022), as well as a higher prevalence of sleep disturbances with PSQI > 5 points (68.9% vs 44.4%, p < 0.001). Sleep disturbance was identified in 68.9% of PD patients. A logistic regression analysis showed that sleep disturbance of PD patients was independently associated with exacerbation of PD symptoms (OR = 3.616, 95%CI= (1.479, 8.844), p = 0.005) and anxiety (OR = 1.379, 95%CI= (1.157, 1.642), p < 0.001). Compared to male PD patients, female ones had higher PSQI scores (9.28 ± 4.41 vs 7.03 ± 4.01, p = 0.009) and anxiety (32.8% vs 0.1%, p = 0.002) and depression prevalence (34.5% vs 11.5%, p = 0.003). Conclusion The findings of the present study emphasize the importance of mental and sleep health interventions in PD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Status and influential factors of anxiety depression and insomnia symptoms in the work resumption period of COVID-19 epidemic: A multicenter cross-sectional study","Objective In this study, the authors analyzed the status of anxiety depression and insomnia symptoms and influential factors in the work resumption period of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted from March 2, 2020 to March 8, 2020 in Shandong Province, China, using quota sampling combined with snowball sampling. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) were used to assess the anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to explore the influential factors. Results A total of 4000 invitations were sent from three centers, 3237 valid questionnaires were received. Based on GAD-7, PHQ-9, and ISI scales, 19.5%–21.7% of the participants had anxiety, depression, or insomnia symptoms; 2.9%–5.6% had severe symptoms. Besides, 2.4%, 4.8%, and 4.5% of the participants had anxiety-depression, anxiety-insomnia, or depression-insomnia combined symptoms. The scores of anxiety and insomnia symptoms, along with scores of depression and insomnia symptoms were positively correlated in these samples. Aged 50–64 years and outside activities once in =30 days were risk factors of anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms in common. During the epidemic, 17.4% of the participants had received psychological interventions, and only 5.2% had received individual interventions. Conclusions The incidence of psychological distress increased during the outbreak of COVID-19 in the work resumption period than the normal period.

"Three months of loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdown","The majority of the U.S. population has been under stay-at-home restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 since March 2020. Over the first three months of restrictions, 3,121 U.S. adults completed the UCLA Loneliness Scale-3 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Despite relaxation of lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders over that time, loneliness scores increased significantly, particularly from April to May 2020, and appear to have plateaued by June. Loneliness was correlated with depression and suicidal ideation at all time points and was most prevalent among individuals who reported that they were still under community restrictions to socially isolate due to the novel coronavirus.

"Prevalence of depression and its impact on quality of life among frontline nurses in emergency departments during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background Frontline medical staff exposed to the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) could be psychologically and mentally exhausted. This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and their correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. Results The overall prevalence of depression in 1103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68–46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and current smokers (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower QOL compared to those without (F (1,1103)=423.83, P<0.001). Conclusion Depression was common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses’ QOL, a heightened awareness of, and early treatment for depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.047","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Depressive symptoms in the front-line non-medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan","Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been raising global anxiety and fear to the real or perceived health threat from the virus. This study aimed to investigate the psychological impacts and depression in the front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan, the first and the worst hit place by COVID-19. Methods: A total of 191 front-line non-medical workers in Wuhan were recruited by online survey. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Stress Reaction Questionnaire (SRQ) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ) were used. Results: The results showed that 50.3% (96) participants reported the clinically significant symptoms of depression. Among them, 33.0% (63) participants were with mild depression, 10.5% (20) participants with moderate depression, 5.8% (11) with moderately severe depression, and 1.0% (2) with severe depression. Participants with depression tend to be post-90 s (the generation born after 1990s), females, with increased levels of stress reactions, increased negative affects, but lower positive affects compared to these without depression. The stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that post-90 s (ß = 0.908, P = 0.016), the emotional reaction (ß = 0.122, P = 0.005) and physical reaction (ß = 0.124, P = 0.020) in SQR were significant independent responsible for the development of depression.

"Changes in alcohol use as a function of psychological distress and social support following COVID-19 related University closings","Amidst the coronavirus pandemic, universities across the country abruptly closed campuses and transitioned to remote learning. The effects of these unprecedented closures are unknown. The current study examined reported alcohol consumption during the week prior to and after campus closure at a public university in Northeast Ohio. Analysis of data from 1,958 students, who endorsed using alcohol in the past 30 days, demonstrates that alcohol consumption (amount and frequency) increased as time progressed. Those with more symptoms of depression and anxiety reported greater increases in alcohol consumption (assessed via retrospective timeline follow-back) compared to students with fewer symptoms. Furthermore, students with greater perceived social support reported less alcohol consumption. Together, these findings highlight the need for universities to offer services and programs to students that will minimize risk factors and maximize protective factors in order to reduce or prevent alcohol abuse during the coronavirus pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106527","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Access to healthcare and prevalence of anxiety and depression in persons with epilepsy during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicountry online survey","Objective The objective of this study was to assess access to healthcare and to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety among persons with epilepsy (PWE) during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods We conducted a multicountry online survey among PWE. Persons with epilepsy were invited to participate through various social media channels. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale were used to score anxiety and depression. Logistic regression modeling was used to investigate factors associated with anxiety and depression. Results Three hundred ninety-nine PWE were included (mean age: 38.22 ± 12.09 years), the majority were female (80.2%) and living in high-income countries (83.2%). Two hundred three PWE reported symptoms of a cold since January 2020. Nine (25%) of the 36 PWE tested for COVID were positive. A total of 72 PWE (19.6%) reported problems to obtain antiseizure medication (ASM), which in 25% of cases was directly COVID-related. Of the 399 PWE, 201 (50.4%) screened positive for anxiety according to the HADS; 159 (39.8%) and 187 (46.9%) PWE screened positive for depression based on the HADS and PHQ-9 scale, respectively. Female gender and financial problems were associated with both depression and anxiety. A planned follow-up consultation with the treating physician was associated with a lower risk of depression, whereas difficulties to access ASM treatment increased the odds of depression. In 65/137 (47.4%) PWE with a planned follow-up visit with the treating physician, this consultation was canceled. Conclusions Innovative approaches are needed to ensure continuity in access to ASM treatment. Healthcare workers should ensure continued follow-up, either through inperson or telehealth appointments, to timely identify symptoms of anxiety and depression and act accordingly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107350","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Trends in suicidal ideation over the first three months of COVID-19 lockdowns","To reduce viral spread during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic, most communities across the U.S. engaged in some form of stay-at-home restrictions or lockdowns that limited social interaction and movement outside the home. To determine the effect of these restrictions on suicidal ideation, a total of 3,120 individuals completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at one of three time points from April through June 2020. The percentage of respondents endorsing suicidal ideation was greater with each passing month for those under lockdown or shelter-in-place restrictions due to the novel coronavirus, but remained relatively stable and unchanged for those who reported no such restrictions.

"Influence of the COVID-19 outbreak in people with epilepsy: Analysis of a Spanish population (EPICOVID registry)","Background The aim of this study was to have a better understanding of the influence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in people with epilepsy (PWE) and to assess whether there have been changes in seizure control during the current COVID-19 outbreak, exploring the possible causes thereof. Methods This is an observational, retrospective study based on prospective data collection of 100 successive patients who attended an epilepsy outpatient clinic either face-to-face or telephonically during the months of the COVID-19 outbreak and national state of emergency. Results One hundred patients were included, 52% women, mean age 42.4 years. During the COVID-19 period, 27% of the patients presented an increase of >50% of seizure frequency. An increase of stress/anxiety (odds ratios (OR): 5.78; p = 0.008) and a prior higher seizure frequency (OR: 12.4; p = 0.001) were associated with worsening of seizures. Other risk factors were exacerbation of depression, sleep deprivation, less physical activity, and history of epilepsy surgery. Three patients had status epilepticus (SE) and one a cluster of seizures. Likewise, 9% of patients improved their seizure control. Reduction in stress/anxiety (OR: 0.05; p = 0.03) and recent adjustment of antiepileptics (OR: 0.07; p = 0.01) acted as protecting factors. Conclusions A high proportion of PWE suffered a significant worsening of their seizure control during the months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Emotional distress due to home confinement was the main factor for the change in seizure control. Promoting physical activity and adequate sleep may minimize the potential impact of the pandemic in PWE. Ensuring correct follow-up can prevent decompensation in those PWE at high risk.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107396","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The role of perceived social support on depression and sleep during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of the present study was to examine the role of perceived social support pertaining to a range of psychological health outcomes amongst individuals undergoing social isolation and social distancing during COVID-19. A total of 2,020 participants provided responses to an online cross-sectional survey comprised of validated instruments including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Brief Irritability Test (BITe) and the UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS). Individuals experiencing self-isolation had significantly higher rates of depression, irritability and loneliness compared to those who were not. The risk for elevated levels of depression symptoms was 63% lower in individuals who reported higher levels of social support compared to those with low perceived social support. Similarly, those with high social support had a 52% lower risk of poor sleep quality compared to those with low social support. Social support was found to be significantly associated with elevated risk for depression and poorer sleep quality.

"Stress and Symptom Burden in Oncology Patients During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Context No information is available on oncology patients' level of stress and symptom burden during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Objectives To evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics, levels of social isolation and loneliness, and the occurrence and severity of common symptoms between oncology patients with low vs. high levels of COVID-19 and cancer-related stress. In addition, to determine which of these characteristics were associated with membership in the high-stressed group. Methods Patients were 18 years and older; had a diagnosis of cancer; and were able to complete an online survey. Results Of the 187 patients in this study, 31.6% were categorized in the stressed group (Impact of Event Scale—Revised [score of =24]). Stressed group's Impact of Event Scale—Revised score exceeds previous benchmarks in oncology patients and equates with probable post-traumatic stress disorder. In this stressed group, patients reported occurrence rates for depression (71.2%), anxiety (78.0%), sleep disturbance (78.0%), evening fatigue (55.9%), cognitive impairment (91.5%), and pain (75.9%). Symptom severity scores equate with clinically meaningful levels for each symptom. Conclusion We identified alarmingly high rates of stress and an extraordinarily high symptom burden among patients with cancer, exceeding those previously benchmarked in this population and on par with noncancer patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. Given that the COVID-19 pandemic will likely impact cancer care for an indefinite period, clinicians must exhibit increased vigilance in their assessments of patients' level of stress and symptom burden.

However, the temporal change of mental health status due to pandemic-related stress in relation to protective and risk factors to hostility is less known. This study was implemented at two timepoints, i.e., during the peak and the remission of the COVID-19 pandemic. 3233 Chinese individuals participated in the first wave, and among them 1390 participants were followed in a second wave. The result showed that fear significantly decreased over time, while depression level significantly increased during the second wave compared to the first wave of the survey. Younger age, lower-income, increased level of perceived stress, and current quarantine experience were significant predictors of depression escalation. Younger people and individuals who had a higher initial stress response tended to show more hostility. Furthermore, the use of negative coping strategy plays a potential intermediating role in the stress-related increase in hostility, while social support acts as a buffer in hostility in the general population under high stress. As the whole world is facing the same pandemic, this research provides several implications for public mental health intervention.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113396","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

In a nationwide online sample of 435 U.S. adults, conducted in March 2020 as the pandemic accelerated and states implemented stay-at-home orders, we examined whether stay-at-home orders and individuals’ personal distancing behavior were associated with symptoms of depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), intrusive thoughts, insomnia, and acute stress. Stay-at-home order status and personal distancing were independently associated with higher symptoms, beyond protective effects of available social resources (social support and social network size). A subsample of 118 participants who had completed symptom measures earlier in the outbreak (February 2020) showed increases in depression and GAD between February and March, and personal distancing behavior was associated with these increases.

"Lockdown, quarantine measures, and social distancing: Associations with depression, anxiety and distress at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic among adults from Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic is suggested to have a negative impact on mental health. To prevent the spread of Sars-CoV-2, governments worldwide have implemented different forms of public health measures ranging from physical distancing recommendations to stay-at-home orders, which have disrupted individuals’ everyday life tremendously. However, evidence on the associations of the COVID-19 pandemic and public health measures with mental health are limited so far. In this study, we investigated the role of sociodemographic and COVID-19 related factors for immediate mental health consequences in a nationwide community sample of adults from Germany (N = 4335). Specifically, we examined the effects of different forms and levels of restriction resulting from public health measures (e.g. quarantine, stay-at-home order) on anxiety and depression symptomatology, health anxiety, loneliness, the occurrence of fearful spells, psychosocial distress and life-satisfaction. We found that higher restrictions due to lockdown measures, a greater reduction of social contacts and greater perceived changes in life were associated with higher mental health impairments. Importantly, a subjectively assumed but not an officially announced stay-at-home order was associated with poorer mental health.

Physicians with no self-reported prior psychiatric conditions were less likely to have symptoms of distress compared to those with such history (OR 0.11, CI [0.33–0.38]). Conclusion Head and neck surgeons in Brazil reported symptoms of burnout, anxiety, distress and depression during our study period within the COVID-19 pandemic. Institutions should monitor these symptoms throughout the pandemic.

"Maternal psychological distress &amp; mental health service use during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Mental health problems are increasingly recognized as a significant and concerning secondary effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on previous epidemics/pandemics suggest that families, particularly mothers, may be at increased risk, but this population has yet to be examined. The current study (1) described prevalence rates of maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms from an online convenience sample during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) identified risk and protective factors for elevated symptoms, and (3) described current mental health service use and barriers. Methods Participants (N = 641) were mothers of children age 0–8 years, including expectant mothers. Mothers completed an online survey assessing mental health, sociodemographic information, and COVID-19-related variables. Results Clinically-relevant depression was indicated in 33.16%, 42.55%, and 43.37% of mothers of children age 0–18 months, 18 months to 4 years, and 5 to 8 years, respectively. Prevalence of anxiety was 36.27%, 32.62%, and 29.59% for mothers across age groups, respectively. Binary logistic regressions indicated significant associations between risk factors and depression/anxiety across child age groups. Limitations Cross-sectional data was used to describe maternal mental health problems during COVID-19 limiting the ability to make inferences about the long-term impact of maternal depression and anxiety on family well-being. Conclusions Maternal depression and anxiety appear to be elevated in the context of COVID-19 compared to previously reported population norms. Identified risk factors for depression and anxiety across different child age ranges can inform targeted early intervention strategies to prevent long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on family well-being and child development.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.081","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Disproportionate Burden of the COVID-19 Pandemic Among Pregnant Black Women","The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted the well-being of vulnerable populations in the US, including Black people. The impact on pregnant women is of special concern for the intrauterine and post-natal development of their offspring. We evaluated in an online survey a sample of 913 pregnant women, 216 Black, 571 White, 126 Other, during a 2-week stay-at-home mandate in the Philadelphia region. We applied logistic regression models and analysis of covariance to examine general and pregnancy-specific worries and negative consequences arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and resilience. Black pregnant women reported greater likelihood of having their employment negatively impacted, more concerns about a lasting economic burden, and more worries about their prenatal care, birth experience, and post-natal needs. In the full sample, 11.1% of women met screening criteria for anxiety and 9.9% met criteria for depression. Black women were more likely to meet criteria for depression than White women, but this difference was not significant accounting for covariates. Resilience factors including self-reliance and emotion regulation were higher in Black women. Racial disparities related to COVID-19 in pregnant women can advance the understanding of pregnancy related stressors and improve early identification of mental health needs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113475","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological distress surveillance and related impact analysis of hospital staff during the COVID-19 epidemic in Chongqing, China","Background Hospital staff are vulnerable and at high risk of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) infection. The aim of this study was to monitor the psychological distress in hospital staff and examine the relationship between the psychological distress and possible causes during the COVID-19 epidemic. Methods An online survey was conducted from February 1 to February 14, 2020. Hospital staff from five national COVID-19 designated hospitals in Chongqing participated. Data collected included demographics and stress responses to COVID-19: 1) the impact of event scale to measure psychological stress reactions; 2) generalizedanxietydisorder 7 to measure anxiety symptoms; 3) Patient Health Questionnaire 9 to measure depression symptoms; 4) Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale to measure obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS); and 5) Patient Health Questionnaire 15 to measure somatization symptoms. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors that were correlated with psychological distress. Results Hospital staff that participated in this study were identified as either doctors or nurses. A total of 456 respondents completed the questionnaires with a response rate of 91.2%. The mean age was 30.67 ± 7.48 years (range, 17 to 64 years). Of all respondents, 29.4% were men. Of the staff surveyed, 43.2% had stress reaction syndrome. The highest prevalence of psychological distress was OCS (37.5%), followed by somatization symptoms (33.3%), anxiety symptoms (31.6%), and depression symptoms (29.6%). Univariate analyses indicated that female subjects, middle aged subjects, subjects in the low income group, and subjects working in isolation wards were prone to experience psychological distress. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed “Reluctant to work or considered resignation” (odds ratio [OR], 5.192; 95%CI, 2.396–11.250; P < .001), “Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family” (OR, 2.099; 95%CI, 1.299–3.391; P = .002) “Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures” (OR, 1.583; 95%CI, 1.061–2.363; P = .025), and“Social support” (OR, 1.754; 95%CI, 1.041–2.956; P = .035) were correlated with psychological reactions. “Reluctant to work or considered resignation” and “Afraid to go home because of fear of infecting family” were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Anxiety (OR, 3.622; 95% CI, 1.882–6.973; P < .001; OR, 1.803; 95% CI, 1.069–3.039; P = .027), OCS (OR, 5.241; 95% CI, 2.545–10.793; P < .001; OR, 1.999; 95% CI, 1.217–3.282; P = .006) and somatization (OR, 5.177; 95% CI, 2.595–10.329; P < .001; OR, 1.749; 95% CI, 1.051–2.91; P = .031). “Stigmatization and rejection in neighborhood because of hospital work”, “Reluctant to work or considered resignation” and “Uncertainty about frequent modification of infection and control procedures” were associated with a higher risk of symptoms of Depression(OR, 2.297; 95% CI, 1.138–4.637; P = .020; OR, 3.134; 95% CI, 1.635–6.006; P = .001; OR, 1.645; 95% CI, 1.075–2.517; P = .022). Conclusions Hospital staff showed different prevalence of psychological distress during the COVID-19 epidemic.

"Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong","Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing are effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health have not been investigated. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I. = [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% (95% C.I. = [18.2%, 27.2%]) of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis risk. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not social network size, were associated with increased psychiatric symptoms.

"The mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on healthcare workers, and interventions to help them: A rapid systematic review","The covid-19 pandemic has heavily burdened healthcare systems throughout the world. We performed a rapid systematic review to identify, assess and summarize research on the mental health impact of the covid-19 pandemic on HCWs (healthcare workers). We utilized the Norwegian Institute of Public Health's Live map of covid-19 evidence on 11 May and included 59 studies. Six reported on implementing interventions, but none reported on effects of the interventions. HCWs reported low interest in professional help, and greater reliance on social support and contact. Exposure to covid-19 was the most commonly reported correlate of mental health problems, followed by female gender, and worry about infection or about infecting others. Social support correlated with less mental health problems. HCWs reported anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and distress during the covid-19 pandemic. We assessed the certainty of the estimates of prevalence of these symptoms as very low using GRADE. Most studies did not report comparative data on mental health symptoms before the pandemic or in the general population. There seems to be a mismatch between risk factors for adverse mental health outcomes among HCWs in the current pandemic, their needs and preferences, and the individual psychopathology focus of current interventions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113441","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Emotional “inflection point” in public health emergencies with the 2019 new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in China","Background The outbreak of the new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) in Wuhan, Hubei, has caused very serious consequences and severely affected people's lives and mental health. The outbreak will cause bad emotions such as tension, anxiety, fear, and so on. College students who have returned home from school face infection, isolation, and delay in starting school, and thus, their emotional stress should be observed. Methods This study used self-designed questionnaires and artificial intelligence (AI) to assess and analyze the emotional state of over 30,000 college students during the outbreak period in January (T1) and home quarantine in February (T2). This survey used online questionnaire (www.wjx.cn) to investigate the emotion information of college students. Results In the T1 survey, the ""Typhoon Eye Effect"" appeared. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. However, in T2, an emotional ""infection point"" appeared, there was an ""Exposure Effect"", the negative emotions of students in Hubei largely increased and became higher than students outside Hubei. Conclusion This survey found that there is an emotional ""infection point"" in February among college students, especially in the Hubei area. College students in Hubei are calmer than those outside Hubei in T1. In contrast, college students in Hubei were more nervous and scared than those outside Hubei in T2. This epidemic has caused the students to experience significant pressure and negative emotions. Therefore, universities and society should pay attention to their emotional adjustment, there are some suggestions such as establish the mental health organizations, test students' emotion status regularly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.097","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"An Acute Manic Episode During 2019-nCoV Quarantine","Background The 2019-nCov pandemic is currently a stressor for the general public worldwide. In China, people who have a history of contact with infected or suspected individuals need to quarantine for at least 2 weeks. Many people experienced anxiety, panic and depression in the quarantine period. However, acute manic episode triggered by stressful events is not common and was neglected. Case presentation A 32-year-old woman with direct contact history with her infected colleagues showed elevated mood and increased activity when she was identified negative of nuclear acid amplification test, after experiencing extreme stress in quarantine. She was diagnosed with acute manic episode finally. The social zeitgeber and reward hypersensitivity theoretical models have attempted to use psychobiological perspectives to determine why life stress can trigger a mood episode, including (hypo)mania. Besides, the temporal correlation between her somatic symptoms and psychological stimuli indicated a possibility of functional disturbance under acute stress. Conclusion Quarantine is a major stressful event disrupting social zeitgebers for people who have had contact with infected individuals, especially for vulnerable individuals with a hypersensitive reward system. Stress could act as a trigger in the onset of manic episode, so psychological support should be more targeted at the vulnerable individuals in the initial phase of emergent crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.07.112","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health status of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis Italian patients returning to work soon after the easing of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic: A monocentric experience","Background The prolonged lockdown related to COVID-19 pandemic determined disruption of lifestyle and social isolation. Methods To assess the mental health status of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) patients regularly followed at the MS center of Catania (Italy) and returning to work after the easing of lockdown during COVID-19 pandemic. Then, to identify any variables associated to psychological distress. RRMS patients returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to answer a telephonic interview consisting of the administration of the Short-Screening-Scale for DSM IV (SSS-DSM-IV), the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Other information was extracted from electronic medical records. Results Valid and complete interviews were obtained from 432 patients (response rate 64.3%). Out of them, 277 (64.1%) were female, mean age 40.4 (SD 12.4) years. One-hundred thirty-seven (31.7%) RRMS patients received a score =4 at the SSS-DSM-IV, indicating clinically significant PTSD-like symptoms. About DASS-21, moderate-to-severe anxiety was reported by 210 RRMS patients (48.6%), moderate-to-severe depression, and moderate-to-severe stress were respectively reported by 95 (22%) and 220 (50.9%) RRMS patients. Insomnia was reported by 128 patients (29.6%). Factors associated with major severity of symptoms were: marital status, previous diagnosis of mood disorders, switching/starting Disease-Modifying Therapies in the last 12 months, and a higher level of disability measured with Expanded Disability Status Scale (for all, p<.05).

"Socio-economic and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on private practice and public hospital radiologists","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an urgent reorganisation of the healthcare system to prevent hospitals from overflowing and the virus from spreading. Our objective was to evaluate the socioeconomic and psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on radiologists. Material and methods French radiologists were invited to answer an online survey during the pandemic through mailing lists. The questionnaire was accessible for nine days. It covered socio-demographic information, exposure to COVID-19 at work and impact on work organisation, and included the Insomnia Severity Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Outcomes were moderate to severe insomnia, definite symptoms of depression or anxiety. Risk and protective factors were identified through multivariate binary logistic regression. Results 1515 radiologists answered the survey. Overall, 674 (44.5 %) worked in a highCOVID-19 density area, 671 (44.3 %) were women, and 809 (53.4 %) worked in private practice. Among responders, 186 (12.3 %) expressed insomnia, 222 (14.6 %) anxiety, and 189 (12.5 %) depression symptoms. Lack of protective equipment, increased teleradiology activity and negative impact on education were risk factors for insomnia (respectively OR [95 %CI]:1.7[1.1-2.7], 1.5[1.1-2.2], and 2.5[1.8-3.6]). Female gender, respiratory history, working in COVID-19 high density area, increase of COVID-19 related activity, and impacted education were risk factors for anxiety (OR[95 %CI]:1.7[1.2-2.3], 2[1.1-3.4], 1.5[1.1-2], 1.2[1-1.4], and 2.1[1.5-3]). Conversely, working in a public hospital was a protective factor against insomnia, anxiety, and depression (OR[95 %CI]:0.4[0.2-0.7], 0.6[0.4-0.9], and 0.5[0.3-0.8]). Conclusions During COVID-19 pandemic, many radiologists expressed depression, anxiety and insomnia symptoms. Working in a public hospital was a protective factor against every psychological symptom.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the health care of &gt;1,000 People living with multiple sclerosis: A cross-sectional study","Background People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) experienced changes in health behaviors and access to MS care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The USA has the highest recognized number of Covid19 infections globally. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 has not been well characterized in large samples of PwMS to date. The MS patient perspective on COVID-19 would complement the physician-reported cases of MS and COVID-19 in the literature. Methods A cross-sectional survey of adult PwMS was performed online, using the U.S.-based patient-powered iConquerMS™ platform, in April 2020. Results There were 1,145 respondents (response rate: 20%). 1,019 had a diagnosis of MS and responded completely (average age: 54.2 years, range: 20-81; 79% female; 64% relapsing remitting, 22% secondary progressive, 12% primary progressive; 88% in the USA). 748 (73%) used a DMT in the last year, primarily higher-efficacy therapies: ocrelizumab (n=238), dimethyl fumarate (n=85), fingolimod (n=80). The most frequent comorbidities were depression (41%), hypertension (26%), and asthma (12%). Women were more worried than men about COVID-19 (p=0.001); non-white-identifying PwMS believed it was a greater danger to their health than white-identifying PwMS (p=0.002). Through the continuum of symptoms to care, 61% of PwMS (n=617) reported symptoms associated with COVID-19, 39% (n=395) knew someone exposed to COVID-19, 4% (n=38) were aware of a personal COVID-19 exposure, 13% (n=128) wanted testing for COVID-19 but could not access it, and 4% (n=43) were tested. Specific to their MS care, 64% (n=650) canceled a medical visit, 22% (n=222) canceled a neurologist visit, 11% (n=112) canceled an MRI, 21% (n=212) canceled a laboratory test, and 10% (n=98) changed their DMT in some way due to COVID19 including 65 delaying at least one dose. 37% (n=382) had a telehealth visit due to COVID-19. 37% of PwMS (n=374) experienced employment changes, most commonly working from home (n=194) and having work hours reduced (n=65) while 32 lost their jobs. Of the 7 cases who tested positive for COVID-19 (<1% of participants) (5 female; age range: 29-64 years), DMTs included dimethyl fumarate (n=2), ocrelizumab (n=1), rituximab (n=1), and a clinical trial drug (n=1). Conclusions A majority of people with MS reported interruptions to their MS care along the MS care pathway alongside limited access to COVID-19 testing. Postponements and delays in care were common with 10% of participants reporting a change in their DMT administration.

"Direct and indirect effects of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on Gaucher Disease patients in Spain: Time to reconsider home-based therapies?","Objective An analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic impact in the Spanish Gaucher Disease (GD) community is presented here. Patients & methods The Spanish GD foundation (FEETEF) surveyed 113 GD patients from March 30 to April 27; all patients provided a verbal consent. Results 110 surveys were analyzed. The median age was 47 years old (y.o.), 31 patients were = 60 y.o.; and 34% of patients reported comorbidities. 46% (51/110) of patients were treated by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), 48 of them at hospitals; 45.1% (45/110) were on substrate reduction therapy (SRT) and 9% (10/110) receive no therapy. 25% (11/48) of ERT-hospital-based patients reported therapy interruptions, while SRT-patients did not report missing doses. No bone crises were reported. However, 50% (55/110) of patients reported being worried about their predisposition to a severe SARS-COV-2 infection and 29% (16/55) of them took anxiolytics or antidepressants for this. While 6 patients reported to have contact with an infected person, another two confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections were reported in splenectomyzed patients, one of them (a 79-year-old diabetic) died.

"Intracranial hemorrhage in critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19","In this study, we report three cases of spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage in patients who were initially hospitalized at our tertiary care center in Washington, DC with symptoms of COVID-19. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was diagnosed in all three patients, who were critically ill, requiring intubation and ventilatory support. During their protracted hospitalizations, subsequent imaging disclosed intracranial hemorrhages, including intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhages, in the context of anticoagulation and coagulopathy. We believe this is related to the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to the endothelial lining of the cerebral vasculature via their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II receptors.

"Effects of COVID-19 in South African health system and society: An explanatory study","Background and aims The underestimation of the severity of COVID-19 by the South African government resulted in delayed action against the pandemic. Ever since WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic preventive action was comprehensively upgraded worldwide. This prompted South African authorities to implement physical distancing, self-isolation, closure of non-essential services, schools, travelling restrictions and recursive national lockdowns to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. This explanatory study sought to review the effects of COVID-19 in the South African health system and society. Methods The study applied literature research of COVID-19 reports, policies from the National Department of Health, WHO, Africa CDC, and articles from Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. Results The South African health system is affected by the lack of PPEs, increased mortality rates, mental health problems, substance abuse, resurgent of NCDs. The closure of international borders, global demand meltdown, supply disruptions, dramatic scaling down of human and industrial activities during lockdown cause socio-economic problems. The prolonged effects of lockdown on psychosocial support services resulted in the outbursts of uncertainties, acute panic, fear, depression, obsessive behaviours, social unrests, stigmatization, anxiety, increased gender-based violence cases and discrimination in the distribution of relief food aid. Conclusion To slow down the spread of COVID-19, massive testing must be adopted, contact tracing, isolation, and home quarantine guidelines for asymptomatic cases which promote behavioural change and reviewing of policy on food relief.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.09.016","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19-related conspiracy beliefs and their relationship with perceived stress and pre-existing conspiracy beliefs","Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID–related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110201","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Social (Un)distancing: Teammate Interactions, Athletic Identity, and Mental Health of Student-Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose Physical distancing measures to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus have presented challenges for the mental health and well-being of college students. As campus activities ceased, student-athletes abruptly became isolated from teammates and were no longer able to participate in sport activities that are often central to their identity as an athlete. However, student-athletes who have supportive social connections with teammates during this pandemic may maintain their athletic identity to a greater extent and report better mental health. The present study examined how student-athletes’ mental health was associated with teammate social support, connectedness, and changes to athletic identity from before to during COVID-19. Method A sample of 234 student-athletes completed surveys before COVID-19 physical distancing (February 2020), with 135 (63% female) participating in a follow-up in the month following school closures (April 2020). Path models estimated the effects of teammate social support and connectedness (during COVID-19), as well as changes in athletic identity on indices of mental health. Results Considering all path models tested, student-athletes who received more social support and reported more connectedness with teammates reported less dissolution of their athletic identity and—in most models—reported better mental health and well-being. Indirect effects indicated that student-athletes’ change in athletic identity mediated the effects of teammate social support on psychological well-being and depression symptoms. Conclusions In addition to advancing theory on how small groups relate to mental health, these findings demonstrate the value in remaining socially connected with peers and maintaining role identities during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.001","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Results The average age of the 950 respondents (RR = 80.9%) was 18.9 ± 2.8 years with 52.1% female and 63.8% white. While 32.6% of participants felt resources were readily available, 35.2% felt resources were difficult to access or unavailable. Participants also described both emotional responses (27.4%) and coping strategies (69.8%). Most emotional responses were negative, including symptoms of anxiety or depression. Commonly reported coping strategies included staying connected and maintaining positivity. Conclusions A significant portion of U.S. youth are experiencing unmet needs and negative emotions due to COVID-19 suggesting additional youth outreach is necessary to ensure basic needs, including socialization, are met.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.07.043","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Are multiple sclerosis patients and their caregivers more anxious and more committed to following the basic preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic?","Background The novel coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19), a pandemic of the kind not seen for a century, has caused global apprehension and distress. Objectives to evaluate whether the psychological state and behaviours of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and their caregivers were different from the non-MS population or not during the pandemic. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 115 MS patients, 33 MS caregivers and 129 healthy controls. Depression anxiety stress score-21 (DASS-21) was used for evaluation of their psychological state. Results MS patients had significantly higher DASS-21 scores (51.48±29.62) than their caregivers (29.79±27.19) and non-MS population (32.91±23.39) (p = 0.005). Younger patients (r=-0.252, p<0.0001), those with high EDSS scores (r = 0.023, p = 0.013) and those who believed that MS patients are at high risk for COVID-19 infection (p = 0.009) had the highest anxiety scores. There was no difference between the three groups in the level of commitment to staying at home (p = 0.747), wearing facemask (p = 0.164), wearing gloves (0.225), avoiding crowd (p = 0.225) and frequent hand washing (p = 0.570). Anxious patients had more relapses (p = 0.002) and pseudorelapses (p = 0.008). Conclusion In this cohort, MS patients were more anxious, stressed and depressed during the COVID-19 pandemic than their caregivers and the non-MS population, but they were not more motivated to follow the basic preventive measures against infection.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2020.102580","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health crisis under COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong, China","Objectives To compare the mental health burden before and during the COVID-19 outbreak and identify the vulnerable groups by sociodemographic factors. Methods We analyzed repeated cross-sectional data from the Hong Kong Family and Health Information Trend Survey (FHInTS) in 2016 (N = 4036) and 2017 (N = 4051) and the COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHInS) in April 9–23, 2020 (N = 1501) using population-based random samples of general adults by landline telephone and online panel. Stress (Perceived Stress Scale 4), anxiety symptoms (General Anxiety Disorders 2), depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), subjective happiness (4-point Likert item), and sociodemographic factors were collected. Results Compared with 2016 and 2017, the stress level increased by 28.3%, prevalence of anxiety increased by 42.3%, and the depression symptoms and unhappiness have doubled (all P for trends <0.001) during the COVID-19 outbreak. The increases in stress levels were significantly larger among older and less educated respondents (P for interactions <0.001). Conclusion Hong Kong had a mental health emergency even with no lockdown and well-managed outbreaks. Older and under-privileged people will suffer most.

"Increases in Loneliness Among Young Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic and Association With Increases in Mental Health Problems","Purpose Young adults are at high risk for increases in loneliness and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study examined increases in loneliness in a young adult sample, for whom increases were greater, and association with increases in depression and anxiety. Method Data from 564 young adults (ages 22–29, 60.7% women) were collected in January 2020 (pre-pandemic) and April/May 2020 (during pandemic). Results Loneliness increased from January to April/May and changes in loneliness were greater for females, those with higher perceived social support in January, and those with greater concerns about the pandemic's social impacts. Depression (but not anxiety) increased during this time with changes in loneliness accounting for much of the increase in depression. Conclusions Intervention strategies with young adults need to address loneliness and feelings of reduced social support during this time, especially for those who may have had greater disruption in their social lives.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.009","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental Health Needs Among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose The abrupt closure of universities across the U.S. in March 2020 may have sent some lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) college students home to unsafe or unaccepting families and environments. The objective of this study was to examine the mental health needs of LGBT college students in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We fielded a rapid-response online survey in the spring of 2020. We recruited 477 LGBT-identifying college students aged 18–25 years by contacting LGBT-serving organizations on 254 college campuses and through targeted social media advertising. Results Nearly half (45.7%) of LGBT college students have immediate families that do not support or know their LGBT identity. Approximately 60% of sampled LGBT college students were experiencing psychological distress, anxiety, and depression during the pandemic. Conclusions Health-care providers, college and university administrators, and campus counseling centers should take swift action to ensure that LGBT students receive mental health support during the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.006","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Language teachers’ coping strategies during the Covid-19 conversion to online teaching: Correlations with stress, wellbeing and negative emotions","Teaching often is listed as one of the most stressful professions and being a language teacher triggers its own unique challenges. Responses to the Covid-19 pandemic have created a long list of new stressors for teachers to deal with, including problems caused by the emergency conversion to online language teaching. This article examines the stress and coping responses of an international sample of over 600 language teachers who responded to an online survey in April 2020. The survey measured stressors and 14 coping strategies grouped into two types, approach and avoidant. Substantial levels of stress were reported by teachers. Correlations show that positive psychological outcomes (wellbeing, health, happiness, resilience, and growth during trauma) correlated positively with approach coping and negatively with avoidant coping. Avoidant coping, however, consistently correlated (rs between 0.42 and 0.54) only with the negative outcomes (stress, anxiety, anger, sadness, and loneliness). In addition, ANOVA showed that although approach coping was consistently used across stress groups, avoidant coping increased as stress increased suggesting that there may be a cost to using avoidant coping strategies. Stepwise regression analyses using the 14 specific coping strategies showed a complex pattern of coping. Suggestions for avoiding avoidance coping strategies are offered.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.system.2020.102352","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Immediate impact of stay-at-home orders to control COVID-19 transmission on socioeconomic conditions, food insecurity, mental health, and intimate partner violence in Bangladeshi women and their families: an interrupted time series","Background Stay-at-home orders (lockdowns) have been deployed globally to control COVID-19 transmission, and might impair economic conditions and mental health, and exacerbate risk of food insecurity and intimate partner violence. The effect of lockdowns in low-income and middle-income countries must be understood to ensure safe deployment of these interventions in less affluent settings. We aimed to determine the immediate impact of COVID-19 lockdown orders on women and their families in rural Bangladesh. Methods An interrupted time series was used to compare data collected from families in Rupganj upazila, rural Bangladesh (randomly selected from participants in a randomised controlled trial), on income, food security, and mental health a median of 1 year and 2 years before the COVID-19 pandemic to data collected during the lockdown. We also assessed women's experiences of intimate partner violence during the pandemic. Results Between May 19 and June 18, 2020, we randomly selected and invited the mothers of 3016 children to participate in the study, 2424 of whom provided consent. 2414 (99·9%, 95% CI 99·6–99·9) of 2417 mothers were aware of, and adhering to, the stay-at-home advice. 2321 (96·0%, 95·2–96·7) of 2417 mothers reported a reduction in paid work for the family. Median monthly family income fell from US$212 at baseline to $59 during lockdown, and the proportion of families earning less than $1·90 per day rose from five (0·2%, 0·0–0·5) of 2422 to 992 (47·3%, 45·2–49·5) of 2096 (p<0·0001 comparing baseline with lockdown period). Before the pandemic, 136 (5·6%, 4·7–6·6) of 2420 and 65 (2·7%, 2·1–3·4) of 2420 families experienced moderate and severe food insecurity, respectively. This increased to 881 (36·5%, 34·5–38·4) of 2417 and 371 (15·3%, 13·9–16·8) of 2417 during the lockdown; the number of families experiencing any level of food insecurity increased by 51·7% (48·1–55·4; p<0·0001). Mothers' depression and anxiety symptoms increased during the lockdown. Among women experiencing emotional or moderate physical violence, over half reported it had increased since the lockdown. Interpretation COVID-19 lockdowns present significant economic, psychosocial, and physical risks to the wellbeing of women and their families across economic strata in rural Bangladesh. Beyond supporting only the most socioeconomically deprived, support is needed for all affected families.

"Mental health outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic: Prevalence and risk factors in a southern US state","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a dramatic effect on the functioning of individuals and institutions around the world. This cross-sectional registry-based study examined some of the burdens of the pandemic, the prevalence of mental health difficulties, and risk factors for psychosocial morbidity among community residents in Arkansas. The study focused on a period of gradual reopening but rising infection rates. The investigation included validated screening measures of depressive symptoms (PHQ-9), generalized anxiety (GAD-7), trauma-related symptoms (PCL-5), and alcohol use (AUDIT-C). A notable percentage of participants reported elevated symptoms on each of these outcomes. In separate multivariable analyses that accounted for a number of demographic and pandemic-related covariates, individuals who reported greater pandemic-related disruption in daily life, and those with a prior history of mental health concerns, were more likely to screen positive for depressive, anxiety and trauma-related symptoms.

"Distance education as a response to pandemics: Coronavirus and Arab culture","Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over-demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox ‘distanceship’.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2020.101317","20201101",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Objective While it is well known that mental health problems are common consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. Methods In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCLC), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. Results It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. Conclusion These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131","20201015",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Prevalence and risk factors of COVID-19 suicidal behavior in Bangladeshi population: are healthcare professionals at greater risk?","Background Current COVID-19 researches suggest that both general population and health-care providers (HCPs) are at risk of elevated psychological sufferings including suicidality. However, suicidality has not been addressed properly, although mental health problems are studied globally. Besides, the extreme fear of COVID-19 infection is being existed among the Bangladeshi HCPs, that is reported by a recent patients' suicide because of HCPs treatment negligence. Methods A web-based cross-sectional study was administered through the social media platforms. A total 3,388 respondents took part in the survey (mean age 30.1 ± 6.4 years) among them 834 were frontline HCPs (30.7 ± 5.6 years). The measures included socio-demographics, PPE-related and patient-care related information and a question concerned with the COVID-19 suicidal behavior. Results About 6.1% of the total participants had suicidal behavior, with no detectable differences within the groups (i.e., general population and HCPs). Regression analysis showed that being female, being divorced, and having no child were emerged as independent predictors for suicidality. There was no significant association between the PPE-related or patient-care related variables and suicidal behavior of the HCPs. Majority of the participants sometimes had fear of death although no significant relation of the factor was found with suicidality. Limitations The study can be limited because of its nature (i.e., cross-sectional self-reporting online survey) and not considering non-COVID-19 related suicide risk factors etc. Conclusions The present findings identified the substantial proportion of the HCPs and general population had COVID 19 related suicidal behavior. It can be used to advocate a large-scale suicide safety plan using a multidisciplinary approach herein.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05259","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"University students’ changes in mental health status and determinants of behavior during the COVID-19 lockdown in Greece","Introduction : The aim of the study was to investigate mental health in university students in Greece, during lockdown due to COVID-19. Material and Methods : The data were collected online and anonymously, during lockdown; they included 1104 females (aged 22.08±4,96) and 431 males (aged 22.35±3.11). The analysis included transformation of the data with post-stratification method, descriptive statistics, Chi-square tests, Factorial Analysis of Variance and Relative Risk ratios Results : The results suggest that during, lockdown major depression was present in 12.43% with 13.46% experiencing severe distress. Risk factors were female sex, history of self-injury, suicidal attempts and following theoretical studies (RR=2–5.71). Conspiracy theories were accepted by 20–68%, with students of theoretical studies manifesting higher rates. Discussion : The results of the current study confirmed that students are at high risk to develop depression and suicidality in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak. They also identified specific risk factors and pointed to the role of believing in conspiracy theories in copying with stress. They also identified populations with higher prevalence of these beliefs. Further targeted research is necessary as well as targeted intervention in vulnerable groups but concerning mental health as well as the reduction of believing in conspiracy theories.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113298","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychological status of healthcare workers during the civil war and COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Objective Healthcare workers, particularly those working in departments that provide care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are at a higher risk of this contagious disease than those who work in other departments. The aim of this study was to assess the psychological status of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak, which has compounded Libya's existing civil war-related problems. Methods A multi-center cross-sectional survey on depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and abuse was conducted. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to measure the prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among healthcare workers. Results The data of 745 eligible healthcare workers from 15 hospitals were analyzed. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were compared to the basic characteristics of the participants to determine the association. A total of 420 (56.3%) participants had depressive symptoms, while 348 (46.7%) had anxiety symptoms. Age, residency status, department, stigmatization, and living in a conflict zone were significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Age, department, years of experience, working hours per week, internal displacement, stigmatization, living in a conflict zone, and verbal abuse were significantly associated with anxiety symptoms. Conclusion Our study presents important findings regarding depressive, anxiety symptoms, and abuse among physicians providing care during the COVID-19 outbreak and civil war in Libya.

"The mental health of frontline and non-frontline medical workers during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China: A case-control study","Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new infectious disease with high transmissibility and morbidity. It has caused substantial mental distress to medical professionals. We aimed to compare the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak between frontline and non-frontline medical workers in China. Methods This case-control study recruited 1173 frontline and 1173 age- and sex-matched non-frontline medical workers during the COVID-19 outbreak (February 11 to 26, 2020). A set of online questionnaires were used to measure mental problems (i.e., anxiety, insomnia, and depressive symptoms), and help-seeking behavior and treatment for these mental problems. Results Frontline medical workers had higher rates of any mental problem (52.6% vs. 34.0%, adjusted OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.57–2.25), anxiety symptoms (15.7% vs. 7.4%, adjusted OR=1.95, 95% CI=1.46–2.61), depressed mood (marginally insignificant; 14.3% vs. 10.1%, adjusted OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.99–1.76) and insomnia (47.8% vs. 29.1%, adjusted OR=1.96, 95% CI=1.63–2.36) than non-frontline medical workers. No significant difference was observed in terms of suicidal ideation (12.0% vs. 9.0%, adjusted OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.92–1.71), help-seeking (4.5% vs. 4.5%, adjusted OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.53–1.87) or treatment (3.4% vs. 2.3%, adjusted OR=1.38, 95% CI=0.54–3.52) for mental problems. Limitations The case-control nature of the data precludes causal inferences, and there is a possibility of bias related to self-reports. Conclusions Frontline medical workers had more mental problems but comparable help-seeking behaviors and treatment for these problems than non-frontline medical workers. These findings highlight the timely mental support and intervention for medical workers, especially for those on the frontline.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.031","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during coronavirus disease-2019 outbreak","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global health emergency. The aim was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Methods Data on the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of 95 RRMS patients were collected. We used a self-designed questionnaire, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 Instrument (MSQOL-54), Hamilton scales for the assessment of anxiety (HAM-A), and depression (HAM-D). Patients who were tested one year ago were reassessed using the same questionnaires during the COVID-19 outbreak. Group of 99 healthy individuals (HC) were tested, using the same questionnaires. Results The main concerns in RRMS patients were that someone that they know could be infected with COVID-19 (78.5%), or could die due to the infection (33.8%), and the lack of specific treatment options (25.8%). The main concerns about the RRMS status were that their disease would be worse if they get infected with COVID-19 (36.4%), that they would experience some difficulties in drug availability (43.6%), that they could not go to the hospital as usual (72.4%). Results on all questionnaires were worse in RRMS patients than in HC (p<0.01). We noticed a statistically significant difference between the results obtained a year ago and the results from April 2020 in HAM-A (p<0.05). Conclusions There is an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of RRMS patients.

"Risk factors associated with mental illness in hospital discharged patients infected with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic can have a profound impact on the mental health of patients who survived the illness. However, little is known about the prevalence rate of mental health disorders among hospital discharged COVID-19 patients and its associated factors. A cross-sectional survey of hospital discharged patients was conducted April 11–22, 2020 in Wuhan, China (where the pandemic began). 675 participants completed the survey, including 90 (13.3%) medical staff (physicians and nurses who had been ill). We used Fisher's exact test and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms associated with COVID-19 hospitalization). Adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 are evident after discharge from the hospital, with sleep difficulties highlighted as a central issue. As we found that perceived discrimination was a central predictor of mental illness, preventing and addressing social stigma associated with COVID-19 may be crucial for improving mental health for recovered patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113297","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological impact of coronavirus disease (2019) (COVID-19) epidemic on medical staff in different posts in China: A multicenter study","Objective An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency of international concern and poses a big challenge to medical staff and general public. The aim is to investigate psychological impact of COVID-19 epidemic on medical staff in different working posts in China, and to explore the correlation between psychological disorder and the exposure to COVID-19. Methods A multicenter WeChat-based online survey was conducted among medical staff in China between 26 February and 3 March 2020. Medical staff deployed to Hubei province from other provinces and medical staffs in different posts outside Hubei were selected to represent diverse exposure intensities to the threat of COVID-19. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, stress and resilience were evaluated using scales including GAD-7, PHQ-9, PSQI, PSS-14, and CD-RISC-10. Latent class analysis was performed to identify potential staff requiring psychological support. Results A total of 274 respondents were included, who serving at 4 posts as follows, staff backing Hubei province, isolation wards outside Hubei, fever clinic and infectious disease department, and other departments outside Hubei. The total scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and stress were statistically different among groups, meanwhile an increasing tendency of anxiety, depression and sleep quality scores with increasing risk of exposure to COVID-19 was found (p < 0.05). Subsequent post-hoc analysis indicated that the staff backing Hubei had higher scores of anxiety, depression, sleep quality and perceived stress (adjusted p < 0.05). The combined prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia of staff backing Hubei reached as high as 38%. Four-class latent class analysis showed 3 categories of population (69.4%) may need psychological support. Conclusions High prevalence of anxiety, depression and insomnia exist in medical staff related to COVID-19. The higher the probability and intensity of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the greater the risk that medical staff will suffer from mental disorders, suggesting continuous and proper psychiatric intervention are needed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.008","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Evaluation of Depression and Anxiety Levels and Related Factors Among Operating Theater Workers During the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic","Purpose Tremendous physical and psychological pressure has been placed on health care workers because of the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to examine the anxiety and depression levels and related factors among health care professionals working in operating theaters (anesthetic technicians and nurses) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Design The universe of this descriptive study consisted of health care professionals working in operating theaters in various health care institutions in Turkey. Methods Data were collected online between April 9, 2020 and April 12, 2020 using a SurveyMonkey Questionnaire (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) and health care workers who volunteered to participate in the study were contacted via the social media platforms Twitter, LinkedIn, and WhatsApp and asked to answer the questionnaire. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 22.0 software. Findings A total of 702 health care professionals working in operating theaters participated in the study. The mean depression and anxiety scores of the participants were found to be 9.4 ± 4.6 (min 0 to max 21) and 10.0 ± 4.5 (min 0 to max 21), respectively. Depression scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals, those who had children, those living with a person aged 60 years or older (P < .05). Meanwhile, anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher among females, single individuals (including widowed and divorced), university graduates, those with at least one chronic disease, and those whose workload increased (P < .05). Conclusions The present study showed that anxiety and depression symptoms were high among health care professionals working in operating theaters. To reduce these symptoms, psychological conditions of health care professionals can be followed continuously and regularly via standard procedures, and necessary interventions can be provided in the early period.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jopan.2020.06.017","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The Effect of Social Support on Mental Health in Chinese Adolescents During the Outbreak of COVID-19","Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacts physical and mental health. The purpose of this study was to explore the association between the levels of social support and mental health among Chinese adolescents during the outbreak. Methods A total of 7,202 adolescents aged 14–18 years completed online survceys from March 8 to 15, 2020, in China. Researchers assessed the associations between depression symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety symptoms (Chinese version of the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and social support (Social Support Rate Scale). Results COVID-19 exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of depression symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14–1.66) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04–1.52). Only 24.6% of adolescents reported high levels of social support. Most adolescents (70%) reported medium levels of support, and 5.4% reported low support. Low support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.38–5.33) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 3.18, 95% CI: 2.54–3.98), while controlling for gender, grade, living situation, and COVID-19 exposure; similarly, medium support was associated with higher prevalence of depression (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 2.48–3.15) and anxiety (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94–2.48) symptoms.

"Prevalence of depression and its association with quality of life in clinically stable patients with COVID-19","Introduction High risk of mental health problems is associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explored the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and its relationship with quality of life (QOL) in clinically stable patients with COVID-19. Methods This was an online survey conducted in COVID-19 patients across five designated isolation hospitals for COVID-19 in Hubei province, China. Depression and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. Results A total of 770 participants were included. The prevalence of depression was 43.1% (95%CI: 39.6%-46.6%). Binary logistic regression analysis found that having a family member infected with COVID-19 (OR=1.51, P = 0.01), suffering from severe COVID-19 infection (OR=1.67, P = 0.03), male gender (OR=0.53, P<0.01), and frequent social media use to obtain COVID-19 related information (OR=0.65, P<0.01) were independently associated with depression.

"Sleep problems among Chinese adolescents and young adults during the coronavirus-2019 pandemic","Objective To assess the prevalence and sociodemographic correlates of insomnia symptoms among Chinese adolescents and young adults affected by the outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Methods This cross-sectional study included Chinese adolescents and young adults 12–29 years of age during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period. An online survey was used to collect demographic data, and to assess recognition of COVID-19, insomnia, depression, and anxiety symptoms using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. The Social Support Rate Scale was used to assess social support. Results Among 11,835 adolescents and young adults included in the study, the prevalence of insomnia symptoms during part of the COVID-19 epidemic period was 23.2%. Binomial logistic regression analysis revealed that female sex and residing in the city were greater risk factors for insomnia symptoms. Depression or anxiety were risk factors for insomnia symptoms; however, social support, both subjective and objective, was protective factors against insomnia symptoms. Furthermore, anxiety and depression symptoms were mediators of social support and insomnia symptoms. Conclusions Results of this study revealed a high prevalence of sleep problems among adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 epidemic, especially senior high school and college students, which were negatively associated with students’ projections of trends in COVID-19. The adverse impact of COVID-19 was a risk factor for insomnia symptoms; as such, the government must devote more attention to sleep disorders in this patient population while combating COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.001","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Mental health symptoms were evaluated with questionnaires, which included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scale, the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale, and questions about patients’ self-perceived illness severity. Multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to explore factors that associated with mental symptoms, and a structural equation model (SEM) was used to assess the possible relationships between those factors and the patients’ mental health. Results Among the 85 participants, 45.9% had symptoms of depression (PHQ-9 = 5), 38.8% had anxiety (GAD-7 = 5), and 54.1% had insomnia (ISI = 8). According to multivariate regression analysis, female sex, a higher level of interleukin (IL)-1ß and greater self-perceived illness severity were all significantly associated with a higher PHQ-9 score, higher GAD-7 score and higher ISI score. In addition, the disease duration and the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were positively related to patients’ self-perceived illness severity. The results of the SEM analyses suggested that sex (ß = 0.313, P < 0.001), self-perceived illness severity (ß = 0.411, P < 0.001) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.358, P = 0.002) had direct effects on patients’ mental health. The disease duration (ß = 0.163, P = 0.003) and levels of inflammatory markers (ß = 0.101, P = 0.016) also indirectly affected patients’ mental health, with self-perceived illness severity acting as a mediator. Conclusion A majority of COVID-19 infected inpatients reported experiencing mental health disturbances. Female sex, disease duration, levels of inflammatory markers and self-perceived illness severity are factors that could be used to predict the severity of patients’ mental symptoms.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.016","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Sleep quality and mental health in the context of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Morocco","Background The lockdown of COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is associated with several stressful factors that can negatively affect peoples' sleep quality and mental health. Objectives: We conducted this study to evaluate sleep disorders and psychological impact associated with the spread of the COVID-19 and the lockdown on the Moroccan population. We also aimed to study the effects of respondents' beliefs and attitudes about sleep on sleep disorders, anxiety-related symptoms, and depressive symptoms. Material and Methods We used a questionnaire enclosing respondents' sociodemographic information, five psychological and behavioral tests including Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep (DBAS-16), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) test. Results Our results highlighted widespread false beliefs about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms within the Moroccan population. Nearly 82.3% of respondents revealed false beliefs about sleep. Furthermore, we confirmed a strong positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes about sleep and the prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms. However, we found no significant difference in the prevalence of sleep and psychological disorders, between healthcare workers and other professions workers. Conclusion Our study revealed a high prevalence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms in the Moroccan population during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Moreover, false beliefs on sleep understanding were prevalent and were presenting a risk factor leading to sleep disorders, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.07.045","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The relationship between physical activity and mental health in a sample of the UK public: A cross-sectional study during the implementation of COVID-19 social distancing measures","Aim The aim of the present study was to investigate the cross-sectional association between physical activity levels with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and positive mental well-being in a sample of the UK public social distancing owing to COVID-19. Method This paper presents pre-planned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Levels of physical activity during COVID-I9 social distancing were self-reported. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Participants also reported on sociodemographic and clinical data. The association between physical activity and mental health was studied using regression models. Results 902 adults were included in this study (63.8% of women and 50.1% of people aged 35–64 years). After adjusting for covariates, there was a negative association between moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day in hours and poor mental health (OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.80–0.97). Similar findings were obtained for moderate-to-severe anxiety symptoms, moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms and poor mental wellbeing. Conclusions In the present sample of UK adults social distancing owing to COVID-19 those who were physically active have better overall mental health. Owing, to the cross-sectional design of the present study the direction of the association cannot be inferred.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhpa.2020.100345","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms in response to COVID-19: A study of the general population in China at the peak of its epidemic","Rationale Psychological resilience is characterized as the ability to respond to extreme stress or trauma or adverse experience successfully. While the relation between public emergencies and psychological distress is well known, research on therelationship between psychological resilience and mental health is very limited during the outbreak of public health emergencies. Objective This research investigated the relationship between psychological resilience and mental health (depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms) among the general population in China. Method Psychological resilience, depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms of 1770 Chinese citizens were investigated during the epidemic peak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (23rd February 2020 to 2nd March 2020). The analyses were done through the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) scale. Results The prevalence of depression, anxiety, somatization symptoms was found to be 47.1%, 31.9%, 45.9%, respectively, among all participants. From them, 18.2% showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression, 8.8% showed moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, and 16.6% showed moderate to severe symptoms of somatization. Psychological resilience was negatively correlated with depression (standardized ß = -0.490, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized ß = -0.443, P < 0.001), and somatization symptom scores (standardized ß = -0.358, P < 0.001), while controlling for confounding factors. Analysis of the three-factor resilience structure showed that strength and tenacity were correlated with depression (standardized ß = -0.256, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.217, P < 0.001), anxiety (standardized ß = -0.268, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.147, P < 0.001), and somatization symptoms (standardized ß = -0.236, P < 0.001; standardized ß = -0.126, P < 0.01). Conclusions Our results suggest that there is a high prevalence of psychological distresses among the general population at the peak of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, which is negatively correlated with resilience. Psychological resilience represents an essential target for psychological intervention in a public health emergency.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2020.113261","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"An investigation of mental health status of children and adolescents in china during the outbreak of COVID-19","Objective : The sudden outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a dramatic effect on the mental health of the public. In the present study, we demonstrated the psychological effects on children and adolescents associated with the epidemic . Methods : By using convenience sampling method, questionnaires, such as Spence Child Anxiety Scale, Child Depression Inventory and Coping style Scale, were distributed to participating 359 children and 3254 adolescents online. Results : The anxiety levels of children and adolescents were (23.87 ± 15.79) and (29.27 ± 19.79), respectively. 22.28% respondents were suffering from depressive symptoms. Seven significant factors associated with increased levels of anxiety, including female, resident in urban regions, emotion-focused coping style. Nine factors associated with increased levels of depression, such as smartphone addiction (OR 1.411, 95% CI 1.099–1.180), Internet addiction (OR 1.844, 95% CI 1.209–2.811), and resident in Hubei province (OR 3.107, 95% CI 1.252–7.708). Two additional factors associated with decreased levels of depressive symptoms: hours spend on Internet per day before the epidemic (OR 0.652, 95% CI 0.609–0.697) and tendency to apply problem-focused coping style (OR 0.937, 95% CI 0.923–0.951). Conclusion : Our findings indicate that the COVID-19 outbreak has had a significant psychosocial impact on children and adolescents. Findings of current levels of anxiety and depression not only highlight the need to address emotional distress for children and adolescents during the epidemic but also provide researchers with scientific fundamentals to formulate targeted interventions based on the significant influencing factors.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.029","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Coping behaviors associated with decreased anxiety and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","Background The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown might increase anxiety and depressive symptoms, but some behaviors may protect against them. Method To provide a preliminary evidence of the behaviors associated with decreased symptoms in the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown, we conducted a survey of 5545 adult individuals from the Spanish general population, two weeks after an official lockdown was established across the country. Results Sixty-five percent of the sample reported anxiety or depressive symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet and not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often were the best predictors of lower levels of anxiety symptoms. Following a healthy/balanced diet, following a routine, not reading news/updates about COVID-19 very often, taking the opportunity to pursue hobbies, and staying outdoors or looking outside were the best predictors of lower levels of depressive symptoms.

"Mental health among healthcare providers during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Saudi Arabia","Background The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was recently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The first confirmed case in Saudi Arabia was announced on March 2, 2020. Several psychiatric manifestations may appear during pandemics, especially among frontline healthcare providers. Objectives This study sought to explore depression and anxiety levels among healthcare providers during the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Methods This was a cross-sectional study of a convenience sample of 502 healthcare providers in the Ministry of Health. Depression and anxiety were assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) questionnaires, respectively. Results The respondents represented various healthcare occupations: administrators (28.49%), nurses (26.29%), physicians (22.11%), non-physician specialists (13.94%), technicians (6.77%), and pharmacists (2.30%). The majority of them were male (68.1%). More than half of them had depressive disorder (55.2%), which ranged from mild (24.9%), moderate (14.5%), and moderately severe (10%) to severe (5.8%). Half of the sample had generalized anxiety disorder (51.4%), which ranged from mild (25.1%) and moderate (11%) to severe (15.3%). Multivariate analysis showed that males were significantly less predicted to have anxiety (Beta=-0.22, P-value <0.04), 30–39 years age group were significantly more predicted to have depression and anxiety group (Beta=0.204, P-value <0.001 and beta=0.521, P-value <0.003 respectively), and nurses had significantly higher mean score of anxiety (Beta=0.445, P-value <0.026). Conclusions This study revealed that depression and anxiety are prevailing conditions among healthcare providers. Although efforts were accelerated to support their psychological well-being, more attention should be paid to the mental health of female, 30–39 age group and nursing staff. Promoting healthcare service as a humanitarian and national duty may contribute to making it a more meaningful experience in addition to advocating for solidarity, altruism, and social inclusion.

"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the general population of Saudi Arabia","Background The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging infection causing a widely spread pandemic of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The current COVID-2019 pandemic is prompting fear of falling sick, dying, helplessness and stigma, urgent and timely understanding of mental health status is needed to help the community. Our investigation designed to survey the general population in Saudi Arabia to assess the degree of psychological impact during the pandemic. Methods During the early stage of the outbreak, we conducted an online-based survey using a snowballing sample technique. The surveys collected data about several aspects of participant sociodemographic, knowledge, concerns, psychological impact, and mental health status. We assessed the psychological impact and mental health status using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Results Our survey recruited 1160 respondents of the general public of Saudi Arabia. Of them, 23.6% reported moderate or severe psychological impact of the outbreak, 28.3%,24%, and 22.3% reported moderate to severe depressive, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Females reported IES-R (B: 5.46, 95% CI: 3.61 to 7.31) and DASS subscales B coefficient ranged from 1.65 to 2.63, along with high-school students, working in the medical field, and poor self-reported health status was significantly associated with a high level of IES-R and DASS scales (p < .05). Experiencing breathing difficulty and dizziness showed a stronger association with higher IES-R and DASS subscales than other somatic symptoms (e.g., headache and fever);(p < .001). Respondents who practiced specific preventative measures (e.g., hand washing, social distancing) demonstrated a protective effect against stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Social distancing appeared to be protective on stress and anxiety subscales (B: -1.49, 95% CI: -2.79 to -0.19),(B: -1.53, 95% CI: -2.50 to -0.57),respectively; and hand hygiene on depression subscale (B: -2.43, 95% CI: -4.44 to -0.42). Conclusion Throughout the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia, the results showed that nearly one-fourth of the sampled general population experienced moderate to severe psychological impact. Following specific precautionary measures appeared to have a protective effect on the individual's mental health.

"Psychological effects of the COVID 19 pandemic on healthcare workers globally: A systematic review","In this systematic review, we compared the incidences of psychological issues during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as anxiety, depression, occupational stress, PTSD and insomnia, in healthcare workers (HCW) and non-healthcare workers (NHCW). PubMed, Ovid, Google Scholar and PsycInfo were systematically searched for related published articles. In all electronic databases, the following search strategy was implemented, and these key words were used: “COVID 19"" OR “SARS-CoV-2"" AND “psychological” OR “stress” OR “depression” AND “healthcare$”. We identified 6 studies, out of the final 15 selected, which reported numerical estimates for incidences of psychological effects. Meta-analysis was conducted, comparing both combined and individual effect sizes of all psychological manifestations. Qualitative evidence was reported from the remaining 9 cross- sectional studies. The summary effects of the combined quantitative meta-analysis conducted on 6 studies did indicate near significant differences between HCW and NHCW. Summary effects of individual manifestations indicated significantly higher incidence of insomnia among HCW, when compared to NHCW. Qualitative evidence from remaining cross-sectional studies provided additional information into the nature of the psychological issues. We conclude that even though reasons for psychological distress among HCW and NHCW may be different, both suffered in equal measures excepting for insomnia.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113360","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Patient-reported Outcomes of Patients With Breast Cancer During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Epicenter of China: A Cross-sectional Survey Study","Introduction We aimed to analyze the psychological status in patients with breast cancer (BC) in the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Patients and Methods A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple BC centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and these included demographic information, clinical features, and 4 patient-reported outcome scales (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7], Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9], Insomnia Severity Index [ISI], and Impact of Events Scale-Revised [IES-R]). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. Results Questionnaires were collected from February 16, 2020 to February 19, 2020, the peak time point of the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Of patients with BC, 46.2% had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. Severe anxiety and severe depression were reported by 8.9% and 9.3% of patients, respectively. Severe distress and insomnia were reported by 20.8% and 4.0% of patients, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes, and close contact with patients with COVID-19 as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and central venous catheter flushing delay were factors that were independently associated with depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. Conclusion High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with BC during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to the psychological status of patients with BC, especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes, and metastatic BC.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The mortality and psychological burden caused by response to COVID-19 outbreak","The world is experiencing a severe COVID-19 outbreak. To control this outbreak, many governments in the world have imposed lockdown or quarantine measures. We hypothesize that these measures may cause additional mortality and morbidity in the (near) future due to delay in diagnosing diseases and other indirect effect on health (such as economic crisis). To support this hypothesis and to estimate the additional mortality that may linked to the COVID-19 controlling policy, we performed a step-by-step pragmatical approach. First, we chose a country (The Netherlands), and looked at the most common causes of mortality in this country. Then, we performed a literature study on the additional mortality when these causes were diagnosed late, and selected a paper with the most severe scenario. We also performed a literature study on the effect of economic crisis on additional mortality. The mortality data were then extrapolated to the demography of The Netherlands, and the results were compared with the present data on deaths directly due to COVID-19. Roughly, we forecast 388 additional deaths a week in The Netherlands in 5 years due to the direct and indirect effects of the lockdown measures. The most important implications of this hypothesis is that the additional mortality and increased mental health problem should be considered in evaluating the necessity of lock down and quarantine policy.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110069","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Modeling suicide risk among parents during the COVID-19 pandemic: Psychological inflexibility exacerbates the impact of COVID-19 stressors on interpersonal risk factors for suicide","Public health researchers have raised the concern that both the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the ensuing public health response will increase interpersonal stressors associated with suicide risk. The Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) framework conceptualizes psychological flexibility as an important way to reduce the impact of painful and even catastrophic events on psychological suffering. The current study examines psychological flexibility as a potential moderator of the prevailing interpersonal model of suicide risk. METHODS: A sample of 1003 parents (73% female, 82% Caucasian 86% in romantic relationships) were recruited as part of a larger study on the COVID-19 pandemic and family functioning from Mach 27th to the end of April 2020, the height of the United States’ “first wave.” Participants completed measures of psychological flexibility (the Multidimensional Psychological Flexibility inventory; MPFI), interpersonal constructs (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness), desire for death, COVID-19 related stressors (resource strain and loss due to COVID-19). RESULTS: Moderated-mediation path models highlighted a significant indirect association between COVID-19 stressors and desire for death mediated by perceived burdensomeness to others. This indirect pathway was moderated by psychological inflexibility such that links were strongest at high levels of inflexibility and weak or non-significant at low levels of inflexibility. Results were generally consistent across five of the six facets of inflexibility. DISCUSSION: The findings highlight the value of targeting psychological inflexibility as an important strategy to reduce suicide risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. Implications of patterns of results across different facets for treatment approach are discussed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.003","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 pandemic and mental health consequences: Systematic review of the current evidence","Background During the COVID-19 pandemic general medical complications have received the most attention, whereas only few studies address the potential direct effect on mental health of SARS-CoV-2 and the neurotropic potential. Furthermore, the indirect effects of the pandemic on general mental health are of increasing concern, particularly since the SARS-CoV-1 epidemic (2002–2003) was associated with psychiatric complications. Methods We systematically searched the database Pubmed including studies measuring psychiatric symptoms or morbidities associated with COVID-19 among infected patients and among none infected groups the latter divided in psychiatric patients, health care workers and non-health care workers. Results A total of 43 studies were included. Out of these, only two studies evaluated patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, whereas 41 evaluated the indirect effect of the pandemic (2 on patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders, 20 on medical health care workers, and 19 on the general public). 18 of the studies were case-control studies/compared to norm, while 25 of the studies had no control groups. The two studies investigating COVID-19 patients found a high level of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (96.2%) and significantly higher level of depressive symptoms (p = 0.016). Patients with preexisting psychiatric disorders reported worsening of psychiatric symptoms. Studies investigating health care workers found increased depression/depressive symptoms, anxiety, psychological distress and poor sleep quality. Studies of the general public revealed lower psychological well-being and higher scores of anxiety and depression compared to before COVID-19, while no difference when comparing these symptoms in the initial phase of the outbreak to four weeks later. A variety of factors were associated with higher risk of psychiatric symptoms and/or low psychological well-being including female gender, poor-self-related health and relatives with COVID-19.

A total of 857 LGB people in Hong Kong participated in a community-based survey study. Over one-fourth of them met the criteria for probable clinical depression (31.5%) and generalized anxiety disorder (27.9%). Besides general stressors, we identified sexual minority-specific stressors during the pandemic. 4.2% of the participants indicated that they had frequently experienced family conflict related to sexual orientation. One-third responded that they had largely reduced connection to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender plus (LGBT+) community (34.7%). The results showed that sexual minority-specific COVID-19-related stressors explained significant variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, above and beyond the contribution of general COVID-19-related stressors. Since LGB people are particularly vulnerable to poor mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, LGB people-targeting organizations need to understand more about family, space, and privacy concerns in order to provide better support, and LGB safe spaces and shelters may be needed as a policy response.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113365","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Prevalence, risk factors and clinical correlates of depression in quarantined population during the COVID-19 outbreak","Background The COVID-19 outbreak has brought tremendous psychological pressure to the general population, which may lead to depression. Therefore, this study aim to evaluate the prevalence and clinical correlates of depressive symptoms in the general population quarantined during the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen. Methods 2237 quarantined general individuals participated in this cross-sectional study from February 14 to March 4, 2020, during their 14 days quarantine. They completed the Zung's Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) for depression, Zung's self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) for sleep quality, and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) for post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Results The prevalence of depressive symptom was 6.21% in quarantined individuals. The depressed group were younger, less married and educated, and had higher SAS, PSQI, IES-R total scores (all p<0.05), as well as more avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal symptoms than the non-depressed group. Correlation analysis showed significant correlations between SDS score and the following parameters: age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total and its three subscale scores (Bonferroni corrected all p<0.05). Further multiple regression indicated that age, marriage, education, SAS, PSQI, IES-R total score, Avoidance and Hyperarousal factor were independent predictors of depressive symptom.

Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reported significantly higher rates of both Major Depressive Disorder (versus, p = 0.023) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (versus, p = 0.044) as compared to the UK-wide estimates. Sub-group analysis showed that anxiety was more common amongst female doctors as compared to males (versus, p = 0.047). Although the prevalence of GAD was higher amongst registrars compared to their Consultant and/or Senior House Officer counterparts, this was not statistically significant. Respondents felt that the most significant factor for work-related changes to mental health was keeping up to date with frequently changing guidelines and protocols related to COVID-19. Only of respondents felt able to talk to colleagues about their mental health. Conclusions Key findings include the high prevalence of mental health conditions amongst doctors, demonstration of the persistent taboo that mental health carries within the speciality and the key contributory factors to poor mental health. Further work should be done to assess if changes to the way new and updating guidelines, protocols and pathways are disseminated reduces the impact on the mental health of doctors. With the threat of a second COVID-19 peak looming, now more than ever, it is vital that steps are taken to break the stigmatisation of mental health amongst doctors, encouraging doctors to seek help when required.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejogrb.2020.07.060","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic among US adults without a pre-existing mental health condition: Findings from American trend panel survey","Most individuals in the United States have no history of a mental health condition yet are at risk for psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency and risk and protective factors of psychological distress, during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, in this group. Data comes from the Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel (ATP), a probability-based online survey panel representative of the US adult population. The analytic sample consisted of 9687 individuals with no prior history of a mental health condition who completed the survey between March 19–24, 2020. Explanatory variables included sociodemographic factors and items related to behavior, perceptions, and experiences surrounding the pandemic. The outcome was psychological distress, measured by five items on symptoms of anxiety, depression, loneliness, sleep difficulties, and hyperarousal. A multivariable linear regression model was used to identify risk and protective factors for psychological distress. Fifteen percent of the sample experienced 2 psychological distress symptoms for at least 3 days over the past week; 13% had three or more symptoms. Risk factors for higher distress included searching online or using social media to post about coronavirus, reporting that the outbreak caused major changes to personal life, and perception that the virus was a threat to the US economy, the individual's personal health or finances. This has important implications for mental health service delivery.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2020.106231","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom, and the demands for psychological knowledge and interventions in college students during COVID-19 epidemic: A large cross-sectional study","Background : Although studies have suggested experiencing the epidemic of severe infectious diseases increased the prevalence of mental health problems, the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom in college students in China was unclear. Methods : A large cross-sectional online survey with 44,447 college students was conducted in Guangzhou, China. The Zung's Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D Scale) were used to define the anxiety and depression symptom, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the association between COVID-19 epidemic and risk of anxiety and depression symptom. Results : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was 7.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 7.5%, 8.0%) and 12.2% (95%CI: 11.9%, 12.5%), respectively. Compared with students who reported have not infected or suspected cases in family members and relatives, students who reported having confirmed (OR=4.06; 95%CI: 1.62, 10.19; P = 0.003), and suspected (OR=2.11; 95%CI: 1.11, 4.00; P = 0.023) cases in family members and relatives had higher risk of depression symptom. Additionally, the proportions of students with anxiety and depression symptom reported more demand of psychological knowledge and interventions than those without (P<0.001). Limitations : All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire, and we did not evaluate the reliability and validity. Conclusions : The prevalence of anxiety and depression symptom was relatively low in college students, but the COVID-19 epidemic-related factors might be associated with higher depression symptom risk.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.06.034","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Anxiety and depression in COVID-19 survivors: Role of inflammatory and clinical predictors","Infection-triggered perturbation of the immune system could induce psychopathology, and psychiatric sequelae were observed after previous coronavirus outbreaks. The spreading of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could be associated with psychiatric implications. We investigated the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in survivors, also considering the effect of clinical and inflammatory predictors. We screened for psychiatric symptoms 402 adults surviving COVID-19 (265 male, mean age 58), at one month follow-up after hospital treatment. A clinical interview and a battery of self-report questionnaires were used to investigate post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, insomnia, and obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptomatology. We collected sociodemographic information, clinical data, baseline inflammatory markers and follow-up oxygen saturation levels. A significant proportion of patients self-rated in the psychopathological range: 28% for PTSD, 31% for depression, 42% for anxiety, 20% for OC symptoms, and 40% for insomnia. Overall, 56% scored in the pathological range in at least one clinical dimension. Despite significantly lower levels of baseline inflammatory markers, females suffered more for both anxiety and depression. Patients with a positive previous psychiatric diagnosis showed increased scores on most psychopathological measures, with similar baseline inflammation. Baseline systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), which reflects the immune response and systemic inflammation based on peripheral lymphocyte, neutrophil, and platelet counts, positively associated with scores of depression and anxiety at follow-up. PTSD, major depression, and anxiety, are all high-burden non-communicable conditions associated with years of life lived with disability. Considering the alarming impact of COVID-19 infection on mental health, the current insights on inflammation in psychiatry, and the present observation of worse inflammation leading to worse depression, we recommend to assess psychopathology of COVID-19 survivors and to deepen research on inflammatory biomarkers, in order to diagnose and treat emergent psychiatric conditions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.07.037","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Facing new fears during the COVID-19 pandemic: The State of America's mental health","Objective COVID-19 is rearranging our society with fear and worry about the novel coronavirus impacting the mental health of Americans. The current study examines the intersection of COVID-19 fear, worries and perceived threat with social vulnerabilities and mental health consequences, namely anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Methods Using an online platform, a national sample (n = 10, 368) of U.S. adults was surveyed during the week of March 23, 2020. The sample was post-strata weighted to ensure adequate representation of the U.S. population based on population estimates for gender, race/ethnicity, income, age, and geography. Results Fear and worry are not distributed equally across the country; rather they are concentrated in places where the largest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is found. Additionally, data highlight significant differences in the subjective perception of distress across groups with varying social vulnerabilities. Women, Hispanics, Asians, families with children under 18, and foreign-born respondents reported higher levels of subjective fear and worry compared to their counterparts. Finally, even after controlling for social vulnerability, subjective assessments of distress were positive, and significantly related to anxiety and depressive symptomatology; prior mental health research from China and Europe confirm what others have begun to document in the United States. Conclusions This preliminary work provides practitioners with a glimpse of what lies ahead, which individuals and communities may be the most vulnerable, and what types of strategic interventions might help to address a wide range of mental health consequences for Americans in the months and years ahead.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102291","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Anxiety and hopelessness levels in COVID-19 pandemic: A comparative study of healthcare professionals and other community sample in Turkey","COVID-19 affected our mental health as well as our physical health. In this study, the anxiety and hopelessness levels of healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers and the factors affecting them were evaluated in Turkey. Beck Hopelessness Scale and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) was applied online to participants. Totally 2156 individuals were included in the study and 52.0% (n:1121) of them are healthcare workers. The hopelessness and state anxiety levels of healthcare workers were higher than non-healthcare workers. Nurses' hopelessness levels are higher than doctors, and state anxiety levels are higher than both doctors and other healthcare workers. Anxiety and hopelessness levels were higher in women, those living with a high-risk individual at home during the pandemic, those who had difficulty in caring for their children, and those whose income decreased. Anxiety levels are an important predictor of hopelessness. The increase in anxiety levels explained 28.9% of the increase in hopelessness levels. Increased working hours is one of the important factors affecting anxiety. As a conclusion, healthcare workers were more affected psychologically in the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the society. Nurses were affected more than other healthcare workers. It is important to identify the factors affecting anxiety, hopelessness, and individuals who may be more psychologically affected during the pandemic. An important contribution can be made to the protection of public health by ensuring that psychosocial interventions for high-risk groups are planned in advance.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.07.024","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Evidence for elevated psychiatric distress, poor sleep, and quality of life concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic among US young adults with suspected and reported psychiatric diagnoses","We report distress levels and functional outcomes based on self-reported pre-existing mental health conditions among U.S. young adults (N=898) during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 13-May 19, 2020). Depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms, as well as COVID-19-related concerns, sleep problems, and quality of life were compared across the following pre-existing mental health groups: 1) no diagnosis, 2) suspected diagnosis, 3) diagnosed and untreated, and 4) diagnosed and treated. Compared to those without a diagnosis, the likelihood of scoring above the clinical threshold for those with a diagnosis - whether treated or not - was more than six-fold for depression, and four-to six-fold for anxiety and PTSD. Individuals with a suspected diagnosis were 3 times more likely to score above the clinical threshold for depression and anxiety and 2 times more as likely to score above this threshold for PTSD compared to those with no diagnosis. We also present higher levels of COVID-19-related worry and grief, poorer sleep, and poorer reported health-related quality of life among those with either a suspected or reported mental health diagnosis.

"Influence of COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological status of infertile couples","Objective(s) to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertile couples’ emotions, anxiety and future plans. Study design An observational study was perfomed by Italian ART centers and online forums. In this study, infertile couples candidate to ART and whose treatment was blocked due to the COVID-19 lockdown were enrolled through an online survey. The psychological impact of COVID-19 was measured by Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and by a short form of the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); Self-perceived anxiety related either to pregnancy safety and to economic crisis measured by VAS scale. Results 627 patients completed the survey. The COVID-19 lock-down had a moderate/severe psychological impact on infertile patients (mean IES-R score 36.4 ± 16.6). The mean STAI score was 49.8 ± 15.3, with an overall incidence of STAI > 36 of 71 %. The mean VAS scale for anxiety perception was 45.3 ± 15.3. Women were more emotionally distressed, anxious and depressed than men (36.8 ± 16.4 vs 31.0 ± 18.4 for IES-R, respectively; p = 0.03). Notwithstanding the uncertainty about pregnancy safety, 64.6 % of respondents chose to maintain their reproductive programme. Economic crisis induced 11.5 % of the surveyed patients to give up their ART program. Respondents who had at least one relative affected by COVID-19 had a significantly higher IES-R score and anxiety VAS, but not higher STAI scores, than patients belonging to unaffected families. Conclusion(s) COVID-19 pandemic itself and the recommendation to stop ART program generated higher distress levels in infertile couples.

"Mental health status of individuals with a mood-disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Initial results from the COLLATE project","Background Physical-distancing strategies during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be particularly detrimental to the mental health of individuals with a pre-existing mood disorder. Data on the mental health status of these individuals during the current pandemic is sparse, and their current mental health needs unclear. Method We characterised COVID-19 related lifestyle changes, primary concerns and psychological distress in n=1292 respondents self-reporting a mood disorder (either bipolar disorder or depressive disorder) and n=3167 respondents without any reported mental disorder from the COLLATE (COvid-19 and you: mentaL heaLth in AusTralia now survEy) project; an Australian national survey launched on April 1st 2020. Results Psychological distress was heightened in the mood disorder group compared to the group with no mental disorder, with stress and depression further elevated in respondents with bipolar disorder compared to those with depressive disorder; and men with bipolar disorder having even higher levels of depression than women with bipolar disorder. Respondents with bipolar disorder were particularly concerned about financial issues associated with COVID-19 compared to those with depressive disorder and those with no mental disorder. Adverse changes to lifestyle behaviours were more prevalent in respondents with a mood disorder and linked to higher levels of distress. Limitations Mood disorder was self-reported and was not clinically verified.

"Health-related quality of life and behavior-related lifestyle changes due to the COVID-19 home confinement: Dataset from a Moroccan sample","The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus initially appeared in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China has caused a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [1]. The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths. Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities’ restrictions could impact the citizens’ health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation. The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2020.106239","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Effectiveness of digital psychological interventions for mental health problems in low-income and middle-income countries: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background The effectiveness of digital psychological interventions in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) remains unclear. We aimed to systematically investigate the available evidence for digital psychological interventions in reducing mental health problems in LMICs. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane databases for articles published in English from database inception to March 9, 2020. We included randomised controlled trials investigating digital psychological interventions in individuals with mental health problems in LMICs. We extracted data on demographics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, details of the intervention, including the setting, digital delivery method, control group conditions, number of sessions, therapeutic orientation (eg, cognitive therapy or behaviour therapy), presence or absence of guidance, and length of follow-up, and statistical information to calculate effect sizes. If a study reported insufficient data to calculate effect sizes, the corresponding authors were contacted to provide data that could be aggregated. We did random-effects meta-analyses, and calculated the standardised mean difference in scores of digital psychological interventions versus control conditions (Hedges' g). Quality of evidence was assessed by use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. The primary outcome was post-intervention mental health problems, as measured by self-reporting instruments or clinical interviews. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019137755. Findings We identified 22 eligible studies that were included in the meta-analysis. The included studies involved a total of 4104 participants (2351 who received a digital psychological intervention and 1753 who were in the control group), and mainly focused on young adults (mean age of the study population was 20–35 years) with depression or substance misuse. The results showed that digital psychological interventions are moderately effective when compared with control interventions (Hedges' g 0·60 [95% CI 0·45–0·75]; Hedges' g with treatment as usual subgroup for comparison 0·54 [0·35–0·73]). Heterogeneity between studies was substantial (I 2=74% [95% CI 60–83]). There was no evidence of publication bias, and the quality of evidence according to the GRADE criteria was generally high. Interpretation Digital psychological interventions, which have been mostly studied in individuals with depression and substance misuse, are superior to control conditions, including usual care, and are moderately effective in LMICs. However, the considerable heterogeneity observed in our analysis highlights the need for more studies to be done, with standardised implementation of digital psychological intervention programmes to improve their reproducibility and efficiency. Digital psychological interventions should be considered for regions where usual care for mental health problems is minimal or absent. Funding None.

"Accelerated Intermittent Theta Burst Stimulation in Late-Life Depression: A Possible Option for Older Depressed Adults in Need of ECT During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an essential psychiatric service with an important role in treating older adults with severe or treatment-resistant depression. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ECT services have be constrained by infection control measures. We report a case of a 66-year-old female patient with a severe major depressive episode who had previously responded to right unilateral ECT and was treated with two modified accelerated intermittent theta-burst stimulation (aiTBS) protocols. Methods The two aiTBS courses consisted of eight daily sessions over five consecutive days, followed by gradual tapering, using 1,800 pulses per session pre-COVID-19 (first course), and 600 pulses per session during the pandemic (second course). Results Moderate to severe baseline depressive symptoms reached remission levels after both courses. Conclusion The 600-pulses aiTBS treatment protocol reported here warrants further study and evaluation, but may be a potential option in cases where older adults with severe depressive symptoms cannot access ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.007","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychological Distress and Its Correlates Among COVID-19 Survivors During Early Convalescence Across Age Groups","Objective To examine the psychological distress and the associated predictor factors of the 2019 corona-virus disease (COVID-19) on survivors in the early convalescence in Shenzhen. Method A survey questionnaire consisting of post-traumatic stress disorder self-rating scale (PTSD-SS), self-rating depression scale (SDS), and self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) was presented to COVID-19 survivors still in quarantine. Scores of each scale and subscale were dependent variables in the Mann-Whitney test and stepwise regression analysis. Results A total of 126 subjects were included in the study, the mean scores of PTSD-SS, SDS, and SAS were 45.5 ± 18.9, 47.3 ± 13.1, and 43.2 ± 10.2, respectively, meanwhile, 9 (31.0%), 28 (22.2%), and 48 (38.1%) of the survivors met the cut-score for clinical significant symptoms of stress response, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Infected family members, and postinfection physical discomforts were significantly associated with scores on all three scales. Social support, retirement, and being female had significant associations with the PTSD-SS score. The survivors aged 60 or above experienced less severe stress response symptoms, fewer emotional symptoms of depression, and fewer anxiety symptoms than younger survivors. Conclusion The occurrence rate of psychological distress among the COVID-19 survivors in early convalescence was high, highlighting the need for all COVID-19 survivors to be screened for psychological distress regularly for timely intervention. The predictors indicated by the current study may help to identify those at high-risk. Besides, the results indicated the older survivors suffered less emotional reactivity and fewer stress response symptoms from infectious diseases than the younger ones.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.07.003","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Mental Health Benefits of Physical Activity in Older Adults Survive the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objective To determine the relationship between the amount and intensity of physical activity performed by older adults in North America (United States and Canada) and their depression and anxiety symptoms while currently under social distancing guidelines (SDG) for the COVID-19 pandemic. Design Descriptive cross-sectional study. Setting Online survey conducted between April 9 and April 30, 2020, during the COVD-19 pandemic. Participants About 1,046 older adults over the age of 50 who live in North America. Measurements Participants were asked about their basic demographic information, current health status, and the impact of the current SDG on their subjective state of mental health. Participants completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity performed, as well as both the Geriatric Depression Scale and Geriatric Anxiety Scale, to ascertain the extent of their depression and anxiety-like symptoms. Results Ninety-seven percent of participants indicated that they adhered to current SDG “Most of the time” or “Strictly.” Participants who performed greater levels of physical activity experienced lower levels of depression-like symptoms when age, sex, and education were accounted for; however, no relationship between physical activity and anxiety-like symptoms was found. A hierarchical regression analysis that incorporated the intensity of physical activity performed (light, moderate, and vigorous) in the model indicated that greater light and strenuous activity, but not moderate, predicted lower depression-like symptoms. Conclusions These results suggest that performing even light physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic may help alleviate some of the negative mental health impacts that older adults may be experiencing while isolated and adhering to SDG during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.024","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychological inflexibility and intolerance of uncertainty moderate the relationship between social isolation and mental health outcomes during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on human activity worldwide, in part due to many governments issuing stay-at-home orders and limiting the types of social interactions in which citizens can engage. Previous research has shown that social isolation can contribute to psychological distress. The impact of increased social isolation on mental health functioning during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as potential mechanisms to buffer this impact, have yet to be investigated. The current study explored the moderating role of psychological flexibility and related constructs on the relationships between social isolation and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional data from 278 participants, the majority residing in the United States, were collected during a 3-week period from mid-April to early May 2020 via online survey. A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated statistically significant relationships between social isolation and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress), well-being, and valued living. Psychological inflexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, and emotional suppression significantly moderated these relationships in a number of instances. Greater psychological flexibility and acceptance of difficult experiences appeared to act as a buffer against the negative effects of increased social isolation, while amplifying the benefits of social connectedness. Implications for promoting mental health and buffering against the harmful effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond are discussed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.005","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children in Bangladesh: A cross-sectional study","COVID-19 pandemic poses a significant mental health threat among children in Bangladesh. This study aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of children during the lockdown in Bangladesh. An online cross-sectional study was conducted from 25th April to 9th May 2020 among 384 parents having at least one child aged between 5–15 years using non-probability sampling. K-means clustering used to group children according to mental health score and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) performed to identify the relationship among the parental behavior and child mental health, and also these associations were assessed through chi-square test. Children were classified into four groups where 43% of child had subthreshold mental disturbances (mean Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)-10; 2.8), 30.5% had mild (mean MDD-10; 8.9), 19.3% suffered moderately (mean MDD-10; 15.9), and 7.2% of child suffered from severe disturbances (mean MDD-10; 25.2). The higher percentage of mental health disturbances of children with the higher education level of parents, relative infected by COVID-19 (yes), parents still need to go the workplace (yes), and parent’s abnormal behavior but lower to their counterparts. This paper demonstrates large proportions of children are suffering from mental health disturbances in Bangladesh during the period of lockdown. Implementation of psychological intervention strategies and improvement in house-hold financial conditions, literacy of parents, taking care of children, and job security may help in improving the psychological/mental status of children and the authors believe that the findings will be beneficial to accelerate the rate of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) linked to health status in Bangladesh.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105277","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental Health in Elderly Spanish People in Times of COVID-19 Outbreak","Background We aim to assess COVID-19 outbreak-related emotional symptoms, identify gender differences, and study the relationship between the emotional state and environmental features in the elderly. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study starting on March 29 to April 5, 2020 based on a national online survey using snowball sampling techniques. Symptoms of anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory) and acute stress (Acute Stress Disorder Inventory) were compared between people over and under 60 years old. Gender differences and the relationship of loneliness, regular exercise, economic losses and use of anxiolytics on the mental state were evaluated. Results One thousand six hundred thirty-nine (150 [9.2%] aged =60) participants completed the survey. The greater than or equal to 60 group showed lower mean (SD) BDI levels than the less than 60 group (3.02 [3.28] versus 4.30 [4.93]); and lower mean (SD) acute stress disorder inventory scores than the less than 60 group (3.68 [3.20] versus 4.45 [3.06]). There were no gender differences in any of the clinical measures. The presence of economic losses as well as the increase in the use of anxiolytics was significantly associated with higher emotional distress in the elderly compared to the younger group. Conclusions Older people have shown less emotional distress, with no differences between men and women.

"The community psychosocial burden during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia","Background Restricting community mobility during COVID-19 can potentially trigger anxiety, depression and stress in the community. The study aims to analyze variables associated with the community psychosocial burden (anxiety level) during the co-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Methods This study collected data (n = 8,031) online. Psychosocial burden was measured based on the anxiety level which include 5 aspects, such as economic, religious, educational, employment, and social issues. Each question used a Likert scale. Six independent were examined, such as age, gender, religion, marital, education, and employement. In the final stage, a multivariate test was performed using a multinomial logistic regression. Results Someone older experienced less high anxiety. The age group of 20–29 years was 4,330 times likely to experience higher anxiety than the age group of =50 years. While, those in the age group of 40–49 years weer 2,322 times more likely to have higher anxiety than those in the age group of =50 years. Male respondents had lower possibility of medium to high anxiety than females. Respondents with secondary and lower education had 3,117 times possibilities to experience higher anxiety than those with high education level.

"Adapting Neurosurgery Practice During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the Indian Subcontinent","Background The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed the practice of neurosurgery. Significant resources have been dedicated to the disease. The pandemic in the Indian subcontinent, compared with the rest of the world, is relatively delayed. The neurosurgical practice cannot remain unaffected by hugely disruptive measures such as a lockdown. The inevitable increase in COVID infections with the gradual relaxation of lockdown continues to pose a risk for health care providers. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate whether the pandemic has had a discernible effect on health care providers, especially in terms of practice modifications in private establishments and publicly funded hospitals, the emotional impact on the surgeon, and the influence of social media on the psyche of the surgeon. Methods An online questionnaire-based survey was prepared, with questions related to the COVID-specific themes of precautions taken in outpatient services and operating theaters, the influence of social media, the economic loss incurred, and the perceptible impact of telemedicine and webinars. The links to the survey were mailed to neurosurgeons in private and public practice countrywide. The responses were anonymized to ensure free and unbiased answers to the survey questions. Results A total of 176 responses were received from across the Indian subcontinent. The median age of respondents was 39 years (range, 32–70 years) and the postresidency experience was 7 years (range, 0–34 years). Respondents were an equitable mix of public and private practitioners. Of respondents, 46% were practicing restricted outpatient services, more in public institutions (P = 0.22) which also had a higher incidence of tele-outpatient services (26% vs. 17%). Wearing surgical masks, N95 masks, and gloves were the most commonly practiced precautionary measures in outpatient services (>60%). Although private practitioners were continuing elective cases (40%), public institutes were more cautious, with only emergency patients being operated on (29%). The greatest fear among all practitioners was passing the infection to their family (75%). Social media were helpful for brainstorming queries and updating practice modifications, but some surgeons admitted to receiving threats on social media platforms (37.5%). Depression and economic losses were palpable for approximately 30% neurosurgeons. Conclusions The survey highlights the perception of neurosurgeons toward the pandemic and the difference in public–private practice. Suspension of elective procedures, severe curtailment of regular outpatient appointments, drastic modifications of the normal outpatient department/operating room practices, and apprehensions related to inadequacy of safety provided by personal protective equipment use and financial losses of private establishments were some of the visible themes in our survey results. Although telemedicine has not been as widely adopted as expected, online education has been favorably received.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.07.038","20201001",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The psychosocial implications of COVID-19 for a neurology program in a pandemic epicenter","Objective We discuss the psychosocial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic as self-reported by housestaff and faculty in the NYU Langone Health Department of Neurology, and summarize how our program is responding to these ongoing challenges. Methods During the period of May 1–4, 2020, we administered an anonymous electronic survey to all neurology faculty and housestaff to assess the potential psychosocial impacts of COVID-19. The survey also addressed how our institution and department are responding to these challenges. This report outlines the psychosocial concerns of neurology faculty and housestaff and the multifaceted support services that our department and institution are offering in response. Faculty and housestaff cohorts were compared with regard to frequencies of binary responses (yes/ no) using the Fisher's exact test. Results Among 130 total survey respondents (91/191 faculty [48%] and 37/62 housestaff [60%]), substantial proportions of both groups self-reported having increased fear (79%), anxiety (83%) and depression (38%) during the COVID-19 pandemic. These proportions were not significantly different between the faculty and housestaff groups. Most respondents reported that the institution had provided adequate counseling and support services (91%) and that the department had rendered adequate emotional support (92%). Participants offered helpful suggestions regarding additional resources that would be helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Effective block by pirfenidone, an antifibrotic pyridone compound (5-methyl-1-phenylpyridin-2[H-1]-one), on hyperpolarization-activated cation current: An additional but distinctive target","Pirfenidone (PFD), a pyridone compound, is well recognized as an antifibrotic agent tailored for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Recently, through its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, PFD based clinical trial has also been launched for the treatment of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). To what extent this drug can perturb membrane ion currents remains largely unknown. Herein, the exposure to PFD was observed to depress the amplitude of hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I h) in combination with a considerable slowing in the activation time of the current in pituitary GH3 cells. In the continued presence of ivabradine or zatebradine, subsequent application of PFD decreased I h amplitude further. The presence of PFD resulted in a leftward shift in I h activation curve without changes in the gating charge. The addition of this compound also led to a reduction in area of voltage-dependent hysteresis evoked by long-lasting inverted triangular (downsloping and upsloping) ramp pulse. Neither the amplitude of M-type nor erg-mediated K+ current was altered by its presence.

"Adolescent psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown","The aim of this paper was to review the literature on adolescent psychiatric disorders related to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. Stressful life events, extended home confinement, brutal grief, intrafamilial violence, overuse of the Internet and social media are factors that could influence the mental health of adolescents during this period. The COVID-19 pandemic could result in increased psychiatric disorders such as Post-Traumatic Stress, Depressive, and Anxiety Disorders, as well as grief-related symptoms. Adolescents with psychiatric disorders are at risk of a break or change in their care and management; they may experience increased symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown may have a negative impact on the mental health of adolescents, although there is still no data on the long term impact of this crisis. Adolescents’ individual, familial, and social vulnerability, as well as individual and familial coping abilities, are factors related to adolescent mental health in times of crisis. Adolescents are often vulnerable and require careful consideration by caregivers and healthcare system adaptations to allow for mental health support despite the lockdown. Research on adolescent psychiatric disorders in times of pandemics is necessary, as such a global situation could be prolonged or repeated.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113264","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Dynamic Diffusion Network: Advancing moral injury care and suicide prevention using an innovative model","Healthcare providers across a wide variety of settings face a common challenge: the need to provide real time care for complex problems that are not adequately addressed by existing protocols. In response to these intervention gaps, frontline providers may utilize existing evidence to develop new approaches that are tailored to specific problems. It is imperative that such approaches undergo some form of evaluation, ensuring quality control while permitting ongoing adaptation and refinement. “Dynamic diffusion” is an innovative approach to intervention improvement and dissemination whereby care practices are delivered and continuously evaluated under real-world conditions as part of a structured network experience. This “dynamic diffusion network” (DDN) promotes cross-pollination of ideas and shared learning to generate relatively rapid improvements in care. The pilot Mental Health and Chaplaincy DDN was developed to advance suicide prevention efforts and moral injury care practices being conducted by 13 chaplain-mental health professional teams across the Veterans Health Administration. Lessons learned from the pilot DDN include the importance of the following: geographic and cultural diversity among innovation collaborators to ensure the broadest possible relevance of solutions; leadership support to facilitate engagement of frontline providers in quality improvement efforts; and participation in a community of practice to motivate providers and offer opportunities for direct collaboration and cross-pollination of ideas.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2020.100440","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Experiences of American Older Adults with Pre-existing Depression During the Beginnings of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicity, Mixed-Methods Study","Objective To determine the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of older adults with pre-existing major depressive disorder (MDD). Participants Participants were 73 community-living older adults with pre-existing MDD (mean age 69 [SD 6]) in Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, and St Louis. Design and Measurements During the first 2 months of the pandemic, the authors interviewed participants with a semistructured qualitative interview evaluating access to care, mental health, quality of life, and coping. The authors also assessed depression, anxiety, and suicidality with validated scales and compared scores before and during the pandemic. Results Five themes from the interviews highlight the experience of older adults with MDD: 1) They are more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus than the risks of isolation. 2) They exhibit resilience to the stress and isolation of physical distancing. 3) Most are not isolated socially, with virtual contact with friends and family. 4) Their quality of life is lower, and they worry their mental health will suffer with continued physical distancing. 5) They are outraged by an inadequate governmental response to the pandemic. Depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation symptom scores did not differ from scores before the pandemic. Conclusion Most older adults with pre-existing MDD show resilience in the first 2 months of the COVID-19 pandemic but have concerns about the future. Policies and interventions to provide access to medical services and opportunities for social interaction are needed to help to maintain mental health and quality of life as the pandemic continues.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.06.013","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The psychological and mental impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on medical staff and general public – A systematic review and meta-analysis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused enormous psychological impact worldwide. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the psychological and mental impact of COVID-19 among healthcare workers, the general population, and patients with higher COVID-19 risk published between 1 Nov 2019 to 25 May 2020. We conducted literature research using Embase, PubMed, Google scholar and WHO COVID-19 databases. Among the initial search of 9207 studies, 62 studies with 162,639 participants from 17 countries were included in the review. The pooled prevalence of anxiety and depression was 33% (95% confidence interval: 28%-38%) and 28% (23%-32%), respectively. The prevalence of anxiety and depression was the highest among patients with pre-existing conditions and COVID-19 infection (56% [39%-73%] and 55% [48%-62%]), and it was similar between healthcare workers and the general public. Studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain and Iran reported higher-than-pooled prevalence among healthcare workers and the general public. Common risk factors included being women, being nurses, having lower socioeconomic status, having high risks of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation. Protective factors included having sufficient medical resources, up-to-date and accurate information, and taking precautionary measures.

"The effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity on mental health during coronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdown in Austria","Background The impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the governmental restrictions on mental health have been reported for different countries. This study evaluated mental health during COVID-19 lockdown in Austria and the effect of age, gender, income, work, and physical activity. Methods An online survey was performed through Qualtrics® after four weeks of lockdown in Austria to recruit a representative sample regarding gender, age, education, and region. Indicators of mental health were quality of life (WHO-QOL BREF), well-being (WHO-5), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-10), and sleep quality (ISI). Results In total, N = 1005 individuals were included (53% women). 21% scored above the cut off =10 points (PHQ-9) for moderate depressive symptoms, 119% scored above the cut-off =10 points (GAD-7) for moderate anxiety symptoms, and 16% above the cut-off =15 points (ISI) for clinical insomnia. ANOVAs, Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc tests, and t-tests showed highest mental health problems in adults under 35 years, women, people with no work, and low income (all p-values <.05). Comparisons with a large Austrian sample recruited within the ATHIS 2014 study showed increases of depression and decreases of quality of life in times of COVID-19 as compared to before COVID-19. Conclusions Depressive symptoms (21%) and anxiety symptoms (19%) are higher during COVID-19 compared to previous epidemiological data. 16% rated over the cut-off for moderate or severe clinical insomnia.

"Special ambulatory gynecologic considerations in the era of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implications for future practice","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has altered medical practice in unprecedented ways. Although much of the emphasis in obstetrics and gynecology to date has been on the as yet uncertain effects of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy and on changes to surgical management, the pandemic has broad implications for ambulatory gynecologic care. In this article, we review important ambulatory gynecologic topics such as safety and mental health, reproductive life planning, sexually transmitted infections, and routine screening for breast and cervical cancer. For each topic, we review how care may be modified during the pandemic, provide recommendations when possible on how to ensure continued access to comprehensive healthcare at this time, and discuss ways that future practice may change. Social distancing requirements may place patients at higher risk for intimate partner violence and mental health concerns, threaten continued access to contraception and abortion services, affect prepregnancy planning, interrupt routine screening for breast and cervical cancer, increase risk of sexually transmitted infection acquisition and decrease access to treatment, and exacerbate already underlying racial and minority disparities in care and health outcomes. We advocate for increased use of telemedicine services with increased screening for intimate partner violence and depression using validated questionnaires. Appointments for long-acting contraceptive insertions can be prioritized. Easier access to patient-controlled injectable contraception and pharmacist-provided hormonal contraception can be facilitated. Reproductive healthcare access can be ensured through reducing needs for ultrasonography and laboratory testing for certain eligible patients desiring abortion and conducting phone follow-up for medication abortions. Priority for in-person appointments should be given to patients with sexually transmitted infection symptoms, particularly if at risk for complications, while also offering expedited partner therapy. Although routine mammography screening and cervical cancer screening may be safely delayed, we discuss society guideline recommendations for higher-risk populations. There may be an increasing role for patient-collected human papillomavirus self-samples using new cervical cancer screening guidelines that can be expanded considering the pandemic situation. Although the pandemic has strained our healthcare system, it also affords ambulatory clinicians with opportunities to expand care to vulnerable populations in ways that were previously underutilized to improve health equity.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.06.006","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children: A systematic review","Background Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), also known as pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, is a new dangerous childhood disease that is temporally associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to describe the typical presentation and outcomes of children diagnosed with this hyperinflammatory condition. Methods We conducted a systematic review to communicate the clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory findings, imaging results, and outcomes of individuals with MIS-C. We searched four medical databases to encompass studies characterizing MIS-C from January 1st, 2020 to July 25th, 2020. Two independent authors screened articles, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. This review was registered with PROSPERO CRD42020191515. Findings Our search yielded 39 observational studies (n = 662 patients). While 71·0% of children (n = 470) were admitted to the intensive care unit, only 11 deaths (1·7%) were reported. Average length of hospital stay was 7·9 ± 0·6 days. Fever (100%, n = 662), abdominal pain or diarrhea (73·7%, n = 488), and vomiting (68·3%, n = 452) were the most common clinical presentation. Serum inflammatory, coagulative, and cardiac markers were considerably abnormal. Mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were necessary in 22·2% (n = 147) and 4·4% (n = 29) of patients, respectively. An abnormal echocardiograph was observed in 314 of 581 individuals (54·0%) with depressed ejection fraction (45·1%, n = 262 of 581) comprising the most common aberrancy. Interpretation Multisystem inflammatory syndrome is a new pediatric disease associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is dangerous and potentially lethal. With prompt recognition and medical attention, most children will survive but the long-term outcomes from this condition are presently unknown. Funding Parker B.

"COVID-19 inpatients with psychiatric disorders: Real-world clinical recommendations from an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry","Background : The management of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders poses several challenges, especially regarding drug interactions. Methods : We report three representative case-scenarios on patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 to provide a practical approach based on the existing literature and the clinical experience of an expert team in consultation-liaison psychiatry. Case-centered recommendations : Psychopharmacological ongoing treatments should be prioritized and most doses should be reduced 25–50% of original dose if the patient receives lopinavir/ritonavir, with some exceptions including quetiapine, asenapine, olanzapine, sertraline, lamotrigine, bupropion, and methadone. If the psychopharmacological usual doses are in the low-to-median range levels, a dose change during COVID-19 drugs co-administration is not recommended, but only ECG and clinical monitoring of adverse effects and drug levels if required. Furthermore, when introducing a psychopharmacological drug, dose titration should be progressive, with ECG monitoring if cardiotoxic interactions are present. (A) In agitated delirium, olanzapine is recommended as first-line antipsychotic and quetiapine should be avoided. (B) In severe mental illness (SMI), essential treatments should be maintained. (C) In non-SMI with depressive/anxiety symptoms, psychological support should be provided and symptoms identified and treated. Limitations : Most recommendations on pharmacological interactions provide only a limited qualitative approach and quantitative recommendations are lacking. Conclusions : Patients with psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 should be managed on a personalized basis considering several clinical criteria and, should not be excluded from receiving COVID-19 treatments. Risks of pharmacological interaction are not absolute and should be contextualized, and most psychopharmacological treatments should include an ECG with special attention to QTc interval.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.149","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","Background COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity Methods Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. Results COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. Limitations Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. Conclusions Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.080","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19, interferons, and depression: A commentary","An option currently being explored for the treatment of COVID-19 is the use of interferons (INFs), either alone or in combination with other antiviral agents. INFs are known to shift the metabolism of tryptophan (TRP) away from its role as a precursor of serotonin. For some patients, reduction in TRP levels may either expose an underlying vulnerability to depression or trigger a de novo episode of depression. This Commentary discusses the pathway involved and recommends in-hospital augmentation with foods or supplements that increase TRP levels for COVID-19 patients treated with INFs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be tried if the depressive symptomatology is not short-lived.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113198","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

To identify factors that may contribute to greater psychological resilience during the first weeks of the nation-wide lockdown efforts, we asked 1,004 U.S. adults to complete assessments of resilience, mental health, and daily behaviors and relationships. Average resilience was lower than published norms, but was greater among those who tended to get outside more often, exercise more, perceive more social support from family, friends, and significant others, sleep better, and pray more often.

"Prevalence and associated factors of poor sleep quality among Chinese returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is a severe global crisis which has resulted in many public health problems. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of poor sleep quality and its related factors among employees who returned to work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Our online cross-sectional study included 2,410 participants aged =17 years in Deqing and Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China from 5th to 14th March 2020. The questionnaire covered information on demographic characteristics, health status, workplace, lifestyle, attitude towards COVID-19, assessment of anxiety, depression and sleep quality. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI) was administered to measure the poor sleep quality. Poor sleep quality was defined as a global PSQI score>5. Factors associated with sleep quality were analyzed by logistic regression models. Results In sum near half (49.2%) of 2,410 returning workers were females and the average year of subjects was 36.3 ± 9.1 years. The overall prevalence of poor sleep quality was 14.9% (95%CI: 13.5%–16.3%). The average score of PSQI was 3.0 ± 2.5 and average sleep duration was 7.6 ± 1.2 h. Independent related factors of poor sleep quality included age older than 24 years, higher education level, negative attitude towards COVID-19 control measures, anxiety and depression. Conclusions Poor sleep quality was common and there was a shorter sleep duration among returning workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Possible risk factors identified from this study may be of great importance in developing proper intervention for the targeted population to improve the sleep health during the COVID-19 public health emergency.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2020.06.034","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children Associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection (MIS-C): A Multi-institutional Study from New York City","Objective To assess clinical characteristics and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2-associated multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Study design Children with MIS-C admitted to pediatric intensive care units in New York City between April 23 and May 23, 2020, were included. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Results Of 33 children with MIS-C, the median age was 10 years; 61% were male; 45% were Hispanic/Latino; and 39% were black. Comorbidities were present in 45%. Fever (93%) and vomiting (69%) were the most common presenting symptoms. Depressed left ventricular ejection fraction was found in 63% of patients with median ejection fraction of 46.6% (IQR, 39.5-52.8). C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, d-dimer, and pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were elevated in all patients. For treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin was used in 18 (54%), corticosteroids in 17 (51%), tocilizumab in 12 (36%), remdesivir in 7 (21%), vasopressors in 17 (51%), mechanical ventilation in 5 (15%), extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in 1 (3%), and intra-aortic balloon pump in 1 (3%). The left ventricular ejection fraction normalized in 95% of those with a depressed ejection fraction. All patients were discharged home with median duration of pediatric intensive care unit stay of 4.7 days (IQR, 4-8 days) and a hospital stay of 7.8 days (IQR, 6.0-10.1 days). One patient (3%) died after withdrawal of care secondary to stroke while on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Conclusions Critically ill children with coronavirus disease-2019-associated MIS-C have a spectrum of severity broader than described previously but still require careful supportive intensive care.

"“I'm Kinda Stuck at Home With Unsupportive Parents Right Now”: LGBTQ Youths' Experiences With COVID-19 and the Importance of Online Support","Purpose LGBTQ youth are a population who experience unique stressors. This study investigated their experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic via Q Chat Space—a national online chat-based support program. Methods Transcript data from 31 synchronous, text-based chats collected during the onset of state-based “social distancing” ordinances in Spring 2020 were analyzed. Results While encountering COVID-19–related stressors likely to be experienced by youth generally, participants' experiences were concomitantly imbued with LGBTQ-specific intrapersonal, interpersonal, and structural challenges. Difficulties included maintaining mental health, being isolated with unsupportive families, and loss of in-person identity-based socialization and support. Conclusions Findings highlight the importance of synchronous, text-based online platforms to enable LGBTQ youth to feel safe to seek support while at home. Given the potential for long-term physical distancing, concerted efforts are required to provide necessary resources and support for LGBTQ youth during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.002","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Infertility remains a top stressor despite the COVID-19 pandemic","Research question What is the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on infertility patients? Design An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was sent to patients who attended a large university-affiliated infertility practice in the USA between 1 January 2019 and 1 April 2020. At three different time-points respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of 10 commonly reported life stressors. Results The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients, with 3604 responses (response rate 34%) received. A total of 2202 non-pregnant female respondents were included in the final analysis. One-third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder, and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one-quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking antidepressant medications. At all three time-points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor among the respondents in early March but, at the time of writing, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66%, respectively). A total of 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Despite the unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19, causing economic and societal uncertainty, the stress of infertility remains significant and is comparable a stressor to the pandemic itself.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.rbmo.2020.05.015","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychological distress, coping behaviors, and preferences for support among New York healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective The mental health toll of COVID-19 on healthcare workers (HCW) is not yet fully described. We characterized distress, coping, and preferences for support among NYC HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This was a cross-sectional web survey of physicians, advanced practice providers, residents/fellows, and nurses, conducted during a peak of inpatient admissions for COVID-19 in NYC (April 9th–April 24th 2020) at a large medical center in NYC (n = 657). Results Positive screens for psychological symptoms were common; 57% for acute stress, 48% for depressive, and 33% for anxiety symptoms. For each, a higher percent of nurses/advanced practice providers screened positive vs. attending physicians, though housestaff's rates for acute stress and depression did not differ from either. Sixty-one percent of participants reported increased sense of meaning/purpose since the COVID-19 outbreak. Physical activity/exercise was the most common coping behavior (59%), and access to an individual therapist with online self-guided counseling (33%) garnered the most interest. Conclusions NYC HCWs, especially nurses and advanced practice providers, are experiencing COVID-19-related psychological distress. Participants reported using empirically-supported coping behaviors, and endorsed indicators of resilience, but they also reported interest in additional wellness resources.

"COVID-19 and Severe Mental Illness: Impact on patients and its relation with their awareness about COVID-19","COVID-19 outbreak has promoted many public health measures in the general population. However, its impact on a vulnerable population with severe mental illness (SMI) is less addressed. Aim of this study was to determine the impact of COVID -19 to patients with SMI and identify its relation with their COVID-19 knowledge. A cross-sectional telephonic survey among 132 patients with SMI who were clinically stable before the COVID-19 pandemic was conducted. A 23 item interview proforma comprising of self-reported knowledge related to COVID-19 by patients and their illness and treatment status from their caregivers. Eleven patients were completely not aware of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Three fourth of patients were not worried about getting COVID-19 and lacks adequate knowledge to identify symptoms. Two-third of patients lacked adequate knowledge of precautionary measures against COVID-19. One out of five patients lacked knowledge of the mode of transmission and stopped their psychiatric treatment. Thirty percent showed features of relapse of symptoms during this lockdown period. In multivariate regression analysis, patients from lower socioeconomic status, low literacy levels, with inadequate social support showed less knowledge related to COVID-19.

"What Does Adolescent Substance Use Look Like During the COVID-19 Pandemic? Examining Changes in Frequency, Social Contexts, and Pandemic-Related Predictors","Purpose The overarching goal of this study was to provide key information on how adolescents' substance use has changed since the corona virus disease (COVID)-19 pandemic, in addition to key contexts and correlates of substance use during social distancing. Methods Canadian adolescents (n = 1,054, M age = 16.68, standard deviation = .78) completed an online survey, in which they reported on their frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, cannabis use, and vaping in the 3 weeks before and directly after social distancing practices had taken effect. Results For most substances, the percentage of users decreased; however, the frequency of both alcohol and cannabis use increased. Although the greatest percentage of adolescents was engaging in solitary substance use (49.3%), many were still using substances with peers via technology (31.6%) and, shockingly, even face to face (23.6%). Concerns for how social distancing would affect peer reputation was a significant predictor of face-to-face substance use with friends among adolescents with low self-reported popularity, and a significant predictor of solitary substance use among average and high popularity teens. Finally, adjustment predictors, including depression and fear of the infectivity of COVID-19, predicted using solitary substance use during the pandemic. Conclusions Our results provide preliminary evidence that adolescent substance use, including that which occurs face to face with peers, thereby putting adolescents at risk for contracting COVID-19, may be of particular concern during the pandemic. Further, solitary adolescent substance use during the pandemic, which is associated with poorer mental health and coping, may also be a notable concern worthy of further investigation.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.06.018","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A mathematical model to guide the re-opening of economies during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19, continues to surge, with more than 12 million laboratory-confirmed cases and over 500,000 deaths worldwide (as of 11 July 2020). Aside from the continued surge in cases and the imperatives of public health concern and saving lives, economic devastation is also mounting with a global depression now seeming inevitable. There is limited attention directed towards people who have recovered from the virus and whether this metric can be useful in guiding when the economy can be re-opened. In this paper, a simpler model is presented in order to guide various countries on the (possible) re-opening of the economy (or re-opening in stages/phases) alongside risk categories and ratios. Factors that need to be considered when applying the model include the healthcare capacity in terms of the number of hospitals, beds and healthcare workers that are available to capacitate this virus. In addition, population size, physical distancing measures, socio-economic disparities, lockdown regulations in each country, and more importantly - the amount and accuracy of testing conducted, is also imperative to consider. Decisions adopted by leaders around the world have the most difficult decision to make (yet), and have to weigh up on what really matters; health or wealth. It is suggested that this model be applied in a number of states/counties and countries in order to gauge the risk of their location being re-opened, by observing their total number of recoveries in proximity to total number of cases.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.06.041","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"High depression and anxiety in people with Alzheimer's disease living in retirement homes during the covid-19 crisis","To cope with Covid-19 and limits its spread among residents, retirement homes have prohibited physical contact between residents and families and friend and, in some cases, even between residents or between residents and caregivers. We investigated the effects of measures against Covid-19 on the mental health of participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) who live in retirement homes in France. We instructed on-site caregivers to assess depression and anxiety in participants with mild AD who live in retirement homes. Fifty-eight participants consented to participate in the study. The participants rated their depression and anxiety during and before the Covid-19 crisis. Participants reported higher depression (p = .005) and anxiety (p = .004) during than before the Covid-19 crisis. These increases can be attributed to the isolation of the residents and/or to the drastic changes in their daily life and care they receive. While, in their effort to prevent infections, retirement homes are forced to physically separate residents from the outside world and to drastically reduce residents’ activities, these decisions are likely to come at a cost to residents with AD and their mental health.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113294","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Método Participan 1.501 personas (rango de edad: 18 a 88 años). Se evaluaron el grado de ansiedad, tristeza y soledad, y la autopercepción del envejecimiento. Se dividió a la muestra en función del grupo de edad y por cuartiles (bajo, intermedios y alto) en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y autopercepción del envejecimiento. Resultados Las personas mayores informan de menor ansiedad y tristeza que los de mediana edad y jóvenes, y los de mediana edad de menores niveles que los jóvenes. Los de mediana edad informan de menor soledad, seguidos de los mayores y los jóvenes. Para cada grupo de edad, aquellos con una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento informan de mayor ansiedad, tristeza y soledad. Hay más comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en jóvenes y menos en mayores; más personas deprimidas en mediana edad, menos mayores con ansiedad, y más mayores y menos jóvenes sin sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva. Para todos los grupos de edad, las personas con comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva son las que tienen puntuaciones altas en autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento. Conclusiones Las personas mayores informan de menos malestar psicológico que otros grupos de edad. Tener una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento perjudica a la salud psicológica, independientemente de la edad. Objectives To analyze differences by age group in anxiety, depression, loneliness and comorbid anxiety and depression in young people, middle aged adults and older adults during the lock-down period at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the association between negative self-perceptions of aging and psychological symptoms controlling by age group. Method Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Results Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging.

The objective of this paper is to present first impressions of this transformation. Methods Using over-the-phone instructions initially, all patients were able to participate with the online therapy program. To reduce screen-time for patients, the nonverbal therapies were shortened. Four patients, aged 64–70 years, started our online program. Results Therapists were positive about the online capabilities and resilience of patients to adapt to the new situation. Prejudices on limited effectiveness of online psychotherapy were counteracted. Sending homework by email and mail seems to facilitate therapy adherence.

"Optimism and COVID-19: A resource to support people in confinement?","Ce texte envisage de porter un regard sur les conséquences psychologiques de la situation sanitaire liée au COVID-19 à partir du concept d’optimisme. Depuis plusieurs années, la psychologie positive s’est saisie de cette notion déjà bien connue du grand public, qui a également fait l’objet d’une élaboration conceptuelle majeure dans le domaine scientifique. À ce titre, il nous semble que le concept d’optimisme soit particulièrement utile et pertinent pour comprendre les conduites de nos concitoyens et son influence possible dans la période de confinement qui s’impose actuellement à tous, de la même manière qu’il est nécessaire de penser l’« après » et ses conséquences à court, moyen et long terme, tant sur le plan économique que sur celui de la santé morale et physique de nos concitoyens. Traditionnellement, être optimiste c’est être confiant dans l’issue positive d’un événement, alors qu’à l’inverse, le pessimisme, c’est plutôt s’attendre au pire. L’incertitude que nous imposent ce virus et les situations inédites qui en découlent nous contraint à penser le monde de demain en des termes nouveaux, ce qui peut être déstabilisant. Comprendre la contribution du concept d’optimisme dans la potentialisation des processus adaptatifs que chacun de nous pourra ou non mobiliser pour faire face et s’adapter à cette crise sanitaire inédite et sans précédent est essentiel. Cela constituera sans doute un défi majeur pour les sciences sociales et la psychologie. C’est la raison pour laquelle nous pensons que le concept d’optimisme peut contribuer à apporter des éléments d’éclairage complémentaires qui nous permettront de mieux saisir les conduites rationnelles (ou non) auxquelles nous pourrions être confrontés dans l’avenir, et dans lesquelles nous sommes déjà impliqués. This text envisages looking at the psychological consequences of the health situation related to COVID-19 from the concept of optimism. Positive psychology has for several years been dealing with this concept, which is well known to the general public, but which has been the subject of major conceptual development in the field of science. It seems to us that the concept of optimism can be particularly useful in understanding and influencing the behaviour of our fellow citizens during the period of confinement that is currently imposed on everyone, in the same way that we must consider the consequences in the short, medium and long term, both economically and in terms of the moral and physical health of our fellow citizens, that is, after the period of confinement. Traditionally, being optimistic means being confident in the positive outcome of an event, whereas pessimism means expecting the worst. The uncertainty that this virus imposes on us and the new situations that it brings about, forces us to think the world in uncertain terms, which can be destabilizing. Understanding the contribution of the concept of optimism in the potential of the adaptive processes that each of us may or may not be able to mobilize to face and adapt to this unprecedented and unprecedented health crisis is essential. This will undoubtedly be a major challenge for the social sciences and psychology. This is why we believe that the concept of optimism can help to provide additional insights that will enable us to better grasp the rational (or non-rational) behaviours that we may face in the future, and in which we are already involved.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2020.06.004","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","Background Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. Results There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9%), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. Conclusions COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100327","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Signal of increased opioid overdose during COVID-19 from emergency medical services data","Background Individuals with opioid use disorder may be at heightened risk of opioid overdose during the COVID-19 period of social isolation, economic distress, and disrupted treatment services delivery. This study evaluated changes in daily number of Kentucky emergency medical services (EMS) runs for opioid overdose between January 14, 2020 and April 26, 2020. Methods We evaluated the statistical significance of the changes in the average daily EMS opioid overdose runs in the 52 days before and after the COVID-19 state of emergency declaration, March 6, 2020. Results Kentucky EMS opioid overdose daily runs increased after the COVID-19 state emergency declaration. In contrast, EMS daily runs for other conditions leveled or declined. There was a 17% increase in the number of EMS opioid overdose runs with transportation to an emergency department (ED), a 71% increase in runs with refused transportation, and a 50% increase in runs for suspected opioid overdoses with deaths at the scene. The average daily EMS opioid overdose runs with refused transportation increased significantly, doubled to an average of 8 opioid overdose patients refusing transportation every day during the COVID-19-related study period. Conclusions This Kentucky-specific study provides empirical evidence for concerns that opioid overdoses are rising during the COVID-19 pandemic and calls for sharing of observations and analyses from different regions and surveillance systems with timely data collection (e.g., EMS data, syndromic surveillance data for ED visits) to improve our understanding of the situation, inform proactive response, and prevent another big wave of opioid overdoses in our communities.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108176","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Conducting research in Radiation Oncology remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic: Coping with isolation","Introduction With the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have been forced to follow strict social isolation guidelines. While crucial to control the pandemic, isolation might have a significant impact on productivity and mental health. Especially for researchers working in healthcare, the current situation is complex. We therefore carried out a survey amongst researchers in the field of radiation oncology to gain insights on the impact of social isolation and working from home and to guide future work. Materials and methods An online survey was conducted between March 27th and April 5th, 2020. The first part contained 14 questions intended to capture an overview of the specific aspects related to research while in isolation. The second (optional) part of the questionnaire was the validated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a self-reported measure used to assess levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Results From 543 survey participants, 48.8% reported to work full-time from home. The impact on perceived productivity, with 71.2% of participants feeling less productive, caused 58% of participants to feel some level of guilt. Compared to normative data, relatively high levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were recorded for the 335 participants who filled out the HADS questionnaire. Group comparisons found the presence of a supportive institutional program as the sole factor of statistical significance in both anxiety and depressive symptom levels. People having to work full-time on location showed higher depressive symptom levels than those working from home. Anxiety scores were negatively correlated with the number of research years. Conclusion Results of the survey showed there is a non-negligible impact on both productivity and mental health. As the radiation oncology research community was forced to work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, lessons can be learned to face future adverse situations but also to improve work-life balance in general.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctro.2020.06.006","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Correlates of symptoms of anxiety and depression and mental wellbeing associated with COVID-19: a cross-sectional study of UK-based respondents","Background: The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. Results: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and =75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and =£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46).

"Maternal choline and respiratory coronavirus effects on fetal brain development: Prenatal coronavirus and choline fetal brain effects","Prenatal COVID-19 infection is anticipated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to affect fetal development similarly to other common respiratory coronaviruses through effects of the maternal inflammatory response on the fetus and placenta. Plasma choline levels were measured at 16 weeks gestation in 43 mothers who had contracted common respiratory viruses during the first 6–16 weeks of pregnancy and 53 mothers who had not. When their infants reached 3 months of age, mothers completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (IBQ-R), which assesses their infants’ level of activity (Surgency), their fearfulness and sadness (Negativity), and their ability to maintain attention and bond to their parents and caretakers (Regulation). Infants of mothers who had contracted a moderately severe respiratory virus infection and had higher gestational choline serum levels (=7.5 mM consistent with U.S. Food and Drug Administration dietary recommendations) had significantly increased development of their ability to maintain attention and to bond with their parents (Regulation), compared to infants whose mothers had contracted an infection but had lower choline levels (<7.5 mM). For infants of mothers with choline levels =7.5 µM, there was no effect of viral infection on infant IBQ-R Regulation, compared to infants of mothers who were not infected. Higher choline levels obtained through diet or supplements may protect fetal development and support infant early behavioral development even if the mother contracts a viral infection in early gestation when the brain is first being formed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.019","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Time from COVID-19 shutdown, gender-based violence exposure, and mental health outcomes among a state representative sample of California residents","Background There is increasing evidence of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant shutdowns on mental health. This issue may be of particular concern to those affected by intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from a California state-representative online survey conducted in the two weeks following the state stay-at-home order, enacted March 19, 2020 (unweighted N = 2081). We conducted a series of multivariate multinomial logistic regressions to assess the associations between a) time since stay-at-home order and b) partner and sexual violence exposure ever with our outcomes of interest: depression and/or anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks. Covariates included demographics and social support. Findings Nearly one in five (19•7%) respondents reported moderate or severe mental health symptoms in the past two weeks; 15•5% had a history of IPV and 10•1% had a history of sexual violence. In models adjusting for gender, partner and sexual violence history, and other demographics, time was significantly associated with greater mental health symptom severity, as were IPV and sexual violence. When we additionally adjusted for current social support, effects of time were lost and effects related to violence were slightly attenuated. Interpretation Time under shutdown is associated with higher odds of depression and anxiety symptoms, and may be worse for those with a history of IPV. However, those with greater social support appear to have better capacity to withstand the mental health impacts of the pandemic. Social support programs, inclusive of those available virtually, may offer an important opportunity to help address increased mental health concerns we are seeing under the pandemic.

"Adipocytokines: Are they the Theory of Everything?","Introduction Adipose tissue secretes various bioactive peptides/proteins, immune molecules and inflammatory mediators which are known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Adipokines play important roles in the maintenance of energy homeostasis, appetite, glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, angiogenesis, immunity and inflammation. Enormous number of studies from all over the world proved that adipocytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of diseases affecting nearly all body systems, which raises the question whether we can always blame adipocytokines as the triggering factor of every disease that may hit the body. Objective Our review targeted the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems including diabetes mellitus, kidney diseases, gynecological diseases, rheumatologic disorders, cancers, Alzheimer’s, depression, muscle disorders, liver diseases, cardiovascular and lung diseases. Methodology We cited more than 33 recent literature reviews that discussed the role played by adipocytokines in the pathogenesis of different diseases affecting different body systems. Conclusion More evidence is being discovered to date about the role played by adipocytokines in more diseases and extra research is needed to explore hidden roles played by adipokine imbalance on disease pathogenesis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.cyto.2020.155144","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Prevalence and correlates of PTSD and depressive symptoms one month after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in a sample of home-quarantined Chinese university students","Background When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. Method The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. Results The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. Conclusions The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Jail incarceration, social sanitary confinement and ways of escape","L’enfermement carcéral et le confinement socio-sanitaire liés à la pandémie du COVID-19 sont rapprochés à la faveur de la diffusion du film documentaire de Valérie Müller Danser sa peine, en notant des comportements réactionnels similaires de la population qui imagine et invente des moyens pour bouger, s’occuper… Le film évoque les ateliers de danse menés dans la prison Les Baumettes de Marseille par le chorégraphe renommé Angelin Preljocaj avec des détenues, jusqu’à la performance Soul Kitchen (1919) dansée hors les murs, bien accueillie par le public. L’expérience carcérale conforte les détenues-danseuses dans les processus de conscience sensorielle et identitaire, d’estime de soi, de réintégration sociale. Les répercussions touchant les corps et les âmes renvoient aussi à une réflexion –en miroir– sur l’actualité anxiogène et contraignante du confinement : cohabitation dans le respect d’autrui ou insupportable (surnombre, conflit, violence conjugale…), détresse des personnes vulnérables ou isolées en EHPAD malgré des aménagements soignant… en insistant sur les ressources psychocorporelles positives, vitalisantes, propices à de bienfaisantes « évasions ». Jail incarceration and social confinement due to a sanitary stay-at-home law against the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are compared to the introduction of dance workshops for imprisoned women charged with long sentences, then followed by an outside performance Soul Kitchen. The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence/her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women start with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, lead by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women's physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population –youth to elderly– try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

"The proteasome as a druggable target with multiple therapeutic potentialities: Cutting and non-cutting edges","Ubiquitin Proteasome System (UPS) is an adaptable and finely tuned system that sustains proteostasis network under a large variety of physiopathological conditions. Its dysregulation is often associated with the onset and progression of human diseases; hence, UPS modulation has emerged as a promising new avenue for the development of treatments of several relevant pathologies, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. The clinical interest in proteasome inhibition has considerably increased after the FDA approval in 2003 of bortezomib for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, which is now used in the front-line setting. Thereafter, two other proteasome inhibitors (carfilzomib and ixazomib), designed to overcome resistance to bortezomib, have been approved for treatment-experienced patients, and a variety of novel inhibitors are currently under preclinical and clinical investigation not only for haematological malignancies but also for solid tumours. However, since UPS collapse leads to toxic misfolded proteins accumulation, proteasome is attracting even more interest as a target for the care of neurodegenerative diseases, which are sustained by UPS impairment. Thus, conceptually, proteasome activation represents an innovative and largely unexplored target for drug development. According to a multidisciplinary approach, spanning from chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology to pharmacology, this review will summarize the most recent available literature regarding different aspects of proteasome biology, focusing on structure, function and regulation of proteasome in physiological and pathological processes, mostly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, connecting biochemical features and clinical studies of proteasome targeting drugs.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2020.107579","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: A multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation","Background Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. Results We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression.

"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19","Background Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. Methods Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. Results Disease itself multiplied by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms of social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children’s usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. Conclusion For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated.

"Predicting adaptive and maladaptive responses to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak: A prospective longitudinal study","Background/Objective The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany. Method Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control. Results In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden. The protective effect of PMH and the negative impact of stress symptoms were mediated by perceived sense of control.

"Psychological states of Bangladeshi people four months after the COVID-19 pandemic: An online survey","Background The COVID-19 pandemic essentially imposes psychological effects on people. As the pandemic progresses, people experience psychological trauma gradually, which can change over time. The present study aimed to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress among Bangladeshi people four months after the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among Bangladeshi citizens aged =18 years from June 1 to June 10, 2020. The participants completed an online questionnaire examining socio-demographic variables and COVID-19 related factors, along with the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21. A total of 1146 respondents have been included in the study. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences, IBM Statistics version 22.0. Results The prevalence of moderate to the extremely severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress was 47.2%, 46.0%, and 32.5%, respectively, with no significant gender differences. The prevalence of anxiety and stress was significantly higher in participants aged >30 than in participants aged 18–30 years. Daily follow up COVID-19 related news, having COVID-19 symptoms so far, having contact (direct or indirect) with COVID-19 infected person, and fear of infection were significantly associated with depression, anxiety, and stress.

"Impact of lockdown on learning status of undergraduate and postgraduate students during COVID-19 pandemic in West Bengal, India","To assess the impact of lockdown amidst COVID-19 on undergraduate and postgraduate learners of various colleges and universities of West Bengal. An online survey was conducted from 1 May to 8 May 2020 to collect the information. A structural questionnaire link using ‘Google form’ was sent to students’ through WhatsApp and E-mail. A total of 232 students provided complete information regarding the survey. The simple percentage distribution was used to assess the learning status of the study participants. During the lockdown period, around 70% of learners were involved in e-learning. Most of the learners were used android mobile for attending e-learning. Students have been facing various problems related to depression anxiety, poor internet connectivity, and unfavorable study environment at home. Students from remote areas and marginalized sections mainly face enormous challenges for the study during this pandemic.

"An analysis on self-management and treatment-related functionality and characteristics of highly rated anxiety apps","Background and objective Anxiety is a common emotion that people often feel in certain situations. But when the feeling of anxiety is persistent and interferes with a person's day to day life then this may likely be an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are a common issue worldwide and can fall under general anxiety, panic attacks, and social anxiety among others. They can be disabling and can impact all aspects of an individual's life, including work, education, and personal relationships. It is important that people with anxiety receive appropriate care, which in some cases may prove difficult due to mental health care delivery barriers such as cost, stigma, or distance from mental health services. A potential solution to this could be mobile mental health applications. These can serve as effective and promising tools to assist in the management of anxiety and to overcome some of the aforementioned barriers. The objective of this study is to provide an analysis of treatment and management-related functionality and characteristics of high-rated mobile applications (apps) for anxiety, which are available for Android and iOS systems. Method A broad search was performed in the Google Play Store and App Store following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol to identify existing apps for anxiety. A set of free and highly rated apps for anxiety were identified and the selected apps were then installed and analyzed according to a predefined data extraction strategy. Results A total of 167 anxiety apps were selected (123 Android apps and 44 iOS apps). Besides anxiety, the selected apps addressed several health issues including stress, depression, sleep issues, and eating disorders. The apps adopted various treatment and management approaches such as meditation, breathing exercises, mindfulness and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results also showed that 51% of the selected apps used various gamification features to motivate users to keep using them, 32% provided social features including chat, communication with others and links to sources of help; 46% offered offline availability; and only 19% reported involvement of mental health professionals in their design. Conclusions Anxiety apps incorporate various mental health care management methods and approaches. Apps can serve as promising tools to assist large numbers of people suffering from general anxiety or from anxiety disorders, anytime, anywhere, and particularly in the current COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2020.104243","20200901",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Implementing an intensive care unit (ICU) diary program at a large academic medical center: Results from a randomized control trial evaluating psychological morbidity associated with critical illness","Background Psychological morbidity in both patients and family members related to the intensive care unit (ICU) experience is an often overlooked, and potentially persistent, healthcare problem recognized by the Society of Critical Care Medicine as Post-intensive Care Syndrome (PICS). ICU diaries are an intervention increasingly under study with potential to mitigate ICU-related psychological morbidity, including ICU-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. As we encounter a growing number of ICU survivors, in particular in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, clinicians must be equipped to understand the severity and prevalence of significant psychiatric complications of critical illness. Methods We compared the efficacy of the ICU diary, written by family and healthcare workers during the patient's intensive care course, versus education alone in reducing acute PTSD symptoms after discharge. Patients with an ICU stay >72 h, who were intubated and mechanically ventilated over 24 h, were recruited and randomized to either receive a diary at bedside with psychoeducation or psychoeducation alone. Intervention patients received their ICU diary within the first week of admission into the intensive care unit. Psychological symptom screening with IES-R, PHQ-8, HADS and GAD-7 was conducted at baseline within 1 week of ICU discharge and at weeks 4, 12, and 24 after ICU discharge. Change from baseline in these scores was assessed using Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results From September 26, 2017 to September 25, 2018, our team screened 265 patients from the surgical and medical ICUs at a single large academic urban hospital. 60 patients were enrolled and randomized, of which 35 patients completed post-discharge follow-up, (n = 18) in the diary intervention group and (n = 17) in the education-only control group. The control group had a significantly greater decrease in PTSD, hyperarousal, and depression symptoms at week 4 compared to the intervention group. There were no significant differences in other measures, or at other follow-up intervals. Both study groups exhibited clinically significant PTSD symptoms at all timepoints after ICU discharge. Follow-up phone interviews with patients revealed that while many were interested in getting follow-up for their symptoms, there were many barriers to accessing appropriate therapy and clinical attention. Conclusions Results from psychological screening tools demonstrate no benefit of ICU diaries versus bedside education-alone in reducing PTSD symptoms related to the intensive care stay. However, our study finds an important gap in clinical practice – patients at high risk for PICS are infrequently connected to appropriate follow-up care. Perhaps ICU diaries would prove beneficial if utilized to support the work within a program providing wrap-around services and close psychiatric follow up for PICS patients. This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ICU-related PTSD in our cohort of survivors, the high barrier to accessing care for appropriate treatment of PICS, and the consequence of that barrier—prolonged psychological morbidity.

"Quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak: Changes in diet and physical activity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease","Aims CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of infection, several governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Data synthesis Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behavior while at home. Conclusion Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020","20200828",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Perinatal depressive and anxiety symptoms of pregnant women during the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak in China","Background On January 20, 2020, a new coronavirus epidemic with human-to-human transmission was officially declared by the Chinese government, which caused significant public panic in China. In light of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, pregnant women may be particularly vulnerable and in special need for preventive mental health strategies. Thus far, no reports exist to investigate the mental health response of pregnant women to the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. Objective This study aimed to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak on the prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms and the corresponding risk factors among pregnant women across China. Study Design A multicenter, cross-sectional study was initiated in early December 2019 to identify mental health concerns in pregnancy using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. This study provided a unique opportunity to compare the mental status of pregnant women before and after the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic. A total of 4124 pregnant women during their third trimester from 25 hospitals in 10 provinces across China were examined in this cross-sectional study from January 1, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Of these women, 1285 were assessed after January 20, 2020, when the coronavirus epidemic was publicly declared and 2839 were assessed before this pivotal time point. The internationally recommended Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was used to assess maternal depression and anxiety symptoms. Prevalence rates and risk factors were compared between the pre- and poststudy groups. Results Pregnant women assessed after the declaration of coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic had significantly higher rates of depressive symptoms (26.0% vs 29.6%, P=.02) than women assessed before the epidemic declaration. These women were also more likely to have thoughts of self-harm (P=.005). The depressive rates were positively associated with the number of newly confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (P=.003), suspected infections (P=.004), and deaths per day (P=.001). Pregnant women who were underweight before pregnancy, primiparous, younger than 35 years, employed full time, in middle income category, and had appropriate living space were at increased risk for developing depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak. Conclusion Major life-threatening public health events such as the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak may increase the risk for mental illness among pregnant women, including thoughts of self-harm. Strategies targeting maternal stress and isolation such as effective risk communication and the provision of psychological first aid may be particularly useful to prevent negative outcomes for women and their fetuses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.05.009","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"University students’ mental health amidst the COVID-19 quarantine in Greece","The COVID-19 hit also Greece but due to early measures and their exceptional success, the death toll is one of the lowest in the world. Here we report the results from the analysis of the responses to an online survey, from the first 1000 university students, concerning the impact of the lockdown on their mental health. Overall, there was a ‘horizontal’ increase in scores; 42.5% for anxiety, 74.3% for depression, and 63.3% increase in total suicidal thoughts. Quantity of sleep increased in 66.3% but quality worsened in 43.0%. Quality of life worsened in 57.0% (same in 27.9%). There was a 25-3 fold increase in possible clinical cases of depression and an almost 8-fold increase in suicidal thoughts. Almost a third accept and one fifth are open to conspiracy theories concerning COVID-19. To our knowledge this is the first study reporting data concerning the impact of lockdown and quarantine on the mental health of university students. While the acute impact seems clear, the long-term consequences are unknown and although suicidal thoughts have risen substantially, it seems unlikely this will result in deaths. However, the results constitute a clear message that vulnerable populations are at a need for specific interventions concerning their mental health issues.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113111","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Unravelling potential severe psychiatric repercussions on healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 crisis","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is putting healthcare professionals, especially those in the frontline, under extreme pressures, with a high risk of experiencing physical exhaustion, psychological disturbances, stigmatization, insomnia, depression and anxiety. We report the case of a general practitioner, without relevant somatic or psychiatric history that experienced a “brief reactive psychosis (298.8)” under stressful circumstances derived from COVID-19. She presented with delusional ideas of catastrophe regarding the current pandemic situation, delusions of self-reference, surveillance and persecution, with high affective and behavioural involvement. Physical examination and all further additional investigations did not reveal any secondary causes. She was administered olanzapine 10 mg with significant psychopathological improvement being later discharged with indications to maintain the treatment. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of severe mental illness in a healthcare professional without previous psychiatric history due to COVID-19 outbreak. Around 85% of patients presenting a brief psychotic disorder will develop a potentially disabling serious psychotic illness in the long-term. This case represents the potentially serious mental health consequences on healthcare professionals throughout the COVID-19 crisis and emphasizes the need to implement urgent measures to maintain staff mental health during the current pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.061","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health status of medical staff in emergency departments during the Coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic in China","Background The emergency department is considered to be a high-risk area, as it is often the first stop for febrile patients who are subsequently diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019. This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. Methods Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. Outcomes A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. Interpretation The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented. Special attention should be paid to local medical staff in Hubei.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.06.002","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Correlation between immune response and self-reported depression during convalescence from COVID-19","Self-reported depression has been observed in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) patients, infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), during discharge from the hospital. However, the cause of this self-reported depression during the convalescent period remains unclear. Here, we report the mental health status of 96 convalescent COVID-19 patients who were surveyed using an online questionnaire at the Shenzhen Samii Medical Center from March 2 to March 12, 2020 in Shenzhen, China. After obtaining their informed consent, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics of patients, including routine blood and biochemical data. The results suggested that patients with self-reported depression exhibited increased immune response, as indicated by increased white blood cell and neutrophil counts, as well as neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. However, the mechanism linking self-reported depression to these cellular changes needs further study. In conclusion, self-reported depression occurred at an early stage in convalescent COVID-19 patients, and changes in immune function were apparent during short-term follow-up of these patients after discharge. Appropriate psychological interventions are necessary, and changes in immune function should be emphasized during long-term follow up of these patients.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.062","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Subjective neurological symptoms frequently occur in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection","Objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a novel pneumonia leading to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Recent studies documented that SARS-Coronavirus2 (SARS-CoV2), responsible for COVID-19, can affect the nervous system. The aim of the present observational study was to prospectively assess subjective neurological symptoms (sNS) in patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Methods We included patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome “Tor Vergata”, medical center dedicated to the treatment of patients with COVID-19 diagnosis, who underwent an anamnestic interview about sNS consisting of 13 items, each related to a specific symptom, requiring a dichotomized answer. Results We included 103 patients with SARS-CoV2 infection. Ninety-four patients (91.3%) reported at least one sNS. Sleep impairment was the most frequent symptom, followed by dysgeusia, headache, hyposmia, and depression. Women more frequently complained hyposmia, dysgeusia, dizziness, numbeness/paresthesias, daytime sleepiness, and muscle ache. Moreover, muscle ache and daytime sleepiness were more frequent in the first 2 days after admission. Conversely, sleep impairment was more frequent in patients with more than 7 days of hospitalization. In these patients we also documented higher white blood cells and lower C-reactive protein levels. These laboratory findings correlated with the occurrence of hyposmia, dysgeusia, headache, daytime sleepiness, and depression. Conclusions Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection frequently present with sNS. These symptoms are present from the early phases of the disease. The possibly intrinsic neurotropic properties of SARS-CoV2 may justify the very high frequency of sNS. Further studies targeted at investigating the consequences of SARS-CoV2 infection on the CNS should be planned.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.037","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COVID 19–Depression and Neurosurgeons","Objective The goal of this survey was to determine factors associated with anxiety/depression among neurosurgeons during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20. Results A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire–20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19–positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). Conclusions Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.06.007","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The evaluation of sleep disturbances for Chinese frontline medical workers under the outbreak of COVID-19","Objective To evaluate sleep disturbances of Chinese frontline medical workers (FMW) under the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and make a comparison with non-FMW. Methods The medical workers from multiple hospitals in Hubei Province, China, volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study. An online questionnaire, including Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), was used to evaluate sleep disturbances and mental status. Sleep disturbances were defined as PSQI>6 points or/and AIS>6 points. We compared the scores of PSQI, AIS, anxiety and depression VAS, as well as prevalence of sleep disturbances between FMW and non-FMW. Results A total of 1306 subjects (801 FMW and 505 non-FMW) were enrolled. Compared to non-FMW, FMW had significantly higher scores of PSQI (9.3 ± 3.8 vs 7.5 ± 3.7; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.47), AIS (6.9 ± 4.3 vs 5.3 ± 3.8; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.38), anxiety (4.9 ± 2.7 vs 4.3 ± 2.6; P < 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.22) and depression (4.1 ± 2.5 vs 3.6 ± 2.4; P = 0.001; Cohen's d = 0.21), as well as higher prevalence of sleep disturbances according to PSQI > 6 points (78.4% vs 61.0%; relative risk [RR] = 1.29; P < 0.001) and AIS > 6 points (51.7% vs 35.6%; RR = 1.45; P < 0.001).

"Prevalence of depression, anxiety, and insomnia among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to significantly affect the mental health of healthcare workers (HCWs), who stand in the frontline of this crisis. It is, therefore, an immediate priority to monitor rates of mood, sleep and other mental health issues in order to understand mediating factors and inform tailored interventions. The aim of this review is to synthesize and analyze existing evidence on the prevalence of depression, anxiety and insomnia among HCWs during the Covid-19 outbreak. Methods A systematic search of literature databases was conducted up to April 17th, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. Risk of bias for each individual study was assessed and data pooled using random-effects meta-analyses to estimate the prevalence of specific mental health problems. The review protocol is registered in PROSPERO and is available online. Findings Thirteen studies were included in the analysis with a combined total of 33,062 participants. Anxiety was assessed in 12 studies, with a pooled prevalence of 23·2% and depression in 10 studies, with a prevalence rate of 22·8%. A subgroup analysis revealed gender and occupational differences with female HCPs and nurses exhibiting higher rates of affective symptoms compared to male and medical staff respectively. Finally, insomnia prevalence was estimated at 38·9% across 5 studies.

"Spectrum of neuropsychiatric manifestations in COVID-19","Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged in December 2019 from Wuhan, China. It typically presents with mild upper respiratory tract infection symptoms and may have life threatening complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute stroke, myocardial infarction, kidney failure, shock, and even death. Coronavirus infections are known to have neuroinvasive potential with consequent neuropsychiatric manifestations. We analyzed COVID-19 adult patients in the TriNetX database, which is a global health collaborative clinical research platform collecting real-time electronic medical records data from a network of health care organizations (HCOs) from January 20, 2020 to June 10th, 2020. 40,469 patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 among whom 9086 (22.5%) patients had neuropsychiatric manifestations. The most common neurologic manifestations included headache (3.7%) and sleep disorders (3.4%), Encephalopathy (2.3%), Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) (1.0%) and 0.6% had seizures. Most common psychiatric manifestations included anxiety and other related disorders (4.6%), mood disorders (3.8%), while 0.2% patients had suicidal ideation.

"Incremental validity of coronaphobia: Coronavirus anxiety explains depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety","The adverse psychological effects of COVID-19 have increased globally. Moreover, the psychological toll may be worsening for this health crisis due to the growing numbers of mass deaths and unemployment levels. Coronaphobia, a relatively new pandemic-related construct, has been shown to be strongly related to functional impairment and psychological distress. However, the extent to which coronaphobia is uniquely accountable for the psychological distress experienced during the COVID-19 crisis has not been systematically investigated. The current study examined this question of incremental validity using online data from 453 adult MTurk workers in the U.S. The results of a series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses demonstrated that coronaphobia explained additional variance in depression, generalized anxiety, and death anxiety, above sociodemographics, COVID-19 factors, and the vulnerability factors of neuroticism, health anxiety, and reassurance-seeking behaviors. These findings suggest that health professionals should be aware of coronaphobia as this expression of pandemic-related stress has reliably demonstrated incremental validity in accounting for major indicators of psychological distress.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102268","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Projected increases in suicide in Canada as a consequence of COVID-19","Macroeconomic indicators, notably unemployment, are significant moderators of suicide. We projected the number of excess suicides in Canada as a consequence of the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment. Annual suicide mortality (2000-2018) and unemployment (2000-2019) data were derived from Statistics Canada. Time-trend regression models were used to evaluate and predict the number of excess suicides in 2020 and 2021 for two possible projection scenarios following the COVID-19 pandemic: 1) an increase in unemployment of 1.6% in 2020, 1.2% in 2021, or 2) an increase in unemployment of 10.7% in 2020, 8.9% in 2021. A percentage point increase in unemployment was associated with a 1.0% increase in suicide between 2000 and 2018. In the first scenario, the rise in unemployment rates resulted in a projected total of 418 excess suicides in 2020-2021 (suicide rate per 100,000: 11.6 in 2020). In the second scenario, the projected suicide rates per 100,000 increased to 14.0 in 2020 and 13.6 in 2021, resulting in 2114 excess suicides in 2020-2021. These results indicate that suicide prevention in the context of COVID-19-related unemployment is a critical priority. Furthermore, timely access to mental healthcare, financial provisions and social/labour support programs, as well as optimal treatment for mental disorders is urgently needed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113104","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"COVID-19 and mental health: A review of the existing literature","The COVID-19 pandemic is a major health crisis affecting several nations, with over 720,000 cases and 33,000 confirmed deaths reported to date. Such widespread outbreaks are associated with adverse mental health consequences. Keeping this in mind, existing literature on the COVID-19 outbreak pertinent to mental health was retrieved via a literature search of the PubMed database. Published articles were classified according to their overall themes and summarized. Preliminary evidence suggests that symptoms of anxiety and depression (16–28%) and self-reported stress (8%) are common psychological reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may be associated with disturbed sleep. A number of individual and structural variables moderate this risk. In planning services for such populations, both the needs of the concerned people and the necessary preventive guidelines must be taken into account. The available literature has emerged from only a few of the affected countries, and may not reflect the experience of persons living in other parts of the world.

"Depression, anxiety, stress levels of physicians and associated factors in Covid-19 pandemics","Aim To investigate anxiety, stress, and depression levels of physicians during the Covid-19 outbreak and explored associated factors in both clinical and general site. Methods An online survey is conducted to asses psychological responses of healthcare workers and related factors during Covid-19 outbreak. It is consisted of three subsections covering the following areas: 1) sociodemographic data 2) information on individuals` working condition 3) Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DAS-21). Results Of all 442 participants, 286 (64.7%) had symptoms of depression, 224 (51.6%) anxiety, and 182 (41.2%) stress. Being female, young, and single, having less work experience, working in frontline were associated with higher scores, whereas having a child was associated with lower scores in each subscale. Factors found to be associated with higher DAS-21 total scores in frontline workers were as follows: increased weekly working hours, increased number of Covid-19 patients cared for, lower level of support from peers and supervisors, lower logistic support, and lower feelings of competence during Covid-19 related tasks. Conclusions Our findings highlight the factors which need to be taken into consideration to protect the mental wellbeing of doctors while fighting with a disaster that has major impacts on society worldwide.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113130","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Clinical implications for US young adult mental health","This study sought to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology in U.S. young adults (18-30 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores = 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores = 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores = 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worry, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety. These factors provide initial guidance regarding the clinical management for COVID-19-related mental health problems.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113172","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Clinically significant fear and anxiety of COVID-19: A psychometric examination of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale","The present study examined the psychometric properties of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) using an online survey of 398 adult Amazon MTurk workers in the U.S. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the CAS measures a reliable (a = 0.92), unidimensional construct with a structure that was shown to be invariant across gender, race, and age. Construct validity was demonstrated with correlations between CAS scores and demographics, coronavirus diagnosis, history of anxiety, coronavirus fear, functional impairment, alcohol/drug coping, religious coping, hopelessness, suicidal ideation, as well as social attitudes (e.g., satisfaction with President Trump). The CAS also demonstrated solid discrimination ability for functional impairment (AUC =0.88), while the original cut score of =9 (76% sensitivity and 90% specificity) showed the strongest diagnostic effectiveness among scores. Overall, these findings are largely consistent with the results of the first CAS investigation and support the validity of this mental health screener for COVID-19 related research and practice.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113112","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact of Covid-19 lockdown on characteristics of autopsy cases in Greece Comparison between 2019 and 2020","In order to reduce transmission of COVID-19, social distancing measures were proposed, including spatial distancing (2m distance), or even generalized lockdown. Main concern was to prevent overwhelming of the healthcare systems, mainly of the intensive care units (ICUs) by decreasing the spreading of the disease. In Greece, the Government, after consulting with experts in the fields of infectious disease and epidemiology, implemented a rather aggressive stance with an early lockdown. Aim of our study, is to identify and compare the characteristics of cases referred for autopsy during the first month of the lockdown period for the COVID-19 outbreak, versus the cases referred during the same period in 2019. 231 autopsy cases were included in our study, 125 in 2019 and 106 in 2020. Regarding gender, age and nationality, no significant differences were detected between the two time periods. Age subgroup analysis demonstrated increased number of cases within the age group 70–79 years, in 2020. As to the place of death, the increase in the percentage of out-of-hospital deaths was not confirmed as statistically significant. Regarding type of death (violent, sudden/unexpected), the drop of violent deaths in the 2020 examined period, was not confirmed as statistically significant; however, further subgroup analysis showed a significant drop of fatal injuries resulting from road traffic accidents in the 2020 period. The slight increase of sudden/unexpected deaths, especially myocardial infarction cases, did not reach statistical significance. One month after lockdown, we cannot detect significant differences in the two time periods examined. Further study should be conducted soon when more data will become available. Frequency of fatal myocardial infarction seems to remain unaffected by the COVID-19 pandemic while deaths resulting from road traffic accidents exhibit a significant decrease. Homicides and suicides remain at low levels, in our jurisdiction area, seemingly unaffected by the COVID-19 outbreak and the subsequent lockdown. It appears that since sudden/unexpected deaths, statistically remain unaffected, the preventive measures taken by the Greek authorities prevented overwhelming of the healthcare system, which could function properly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2020.110365","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Filtration performances of non-medical materials as candidates for manufacturing facemasks and respirators","The recent outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is causing a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in different countries around the world. Because the coronavirus can transmit through droplets and aerosols, facemasks and N95 respirators that require complex certification, are urgently needed. Given the situation, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that “in settings where facemasks are not available, healthcare personnel might use homemade masks (e.g., bandana, scarf) for the care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.” Although aerosols and droplets can be removed through the fibers of fabrics through a series of filtration mechanisms, their filtration performances have not been evaluated in detail. Moreover, there are a series of non-medical materials available on the market, such as household air filters, coffee filters, and different types of fabrics, which may be useful when facemasks and respirators are not available. In this study, we comprehensively evaluated the overall and size-dependent filtration performances of non-medical materials. The experiments were conducted under different face velocities to study its influence on size-dependent filtration performances. The flow resistance across these filter materials is measured as an indicator of the breathability of the materials. The results illustrate that multiple layers of household air filters are able to achieve similar filtration efficiencies compared to the N95 material without causing a significant increase in flow resistance. Considering that these air filters may shed micrometer fibers during the cutting and folding processes, it is recommended that these filters should be inserted in multiple layers of fabrics when manufacturing facemasks or respirators.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijheh.2020.113582","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Protocol for a partially nested randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the scleroderma patient-centered intervention network COVID-19 home-isolation activities together (SPIN-CHAT) program to reduce anxiety among at-risk scleroderma patients","Objective Contagious disease outbreaks and related restrictions can lead to negative psychological outcomes, particularly in vulnerable populations at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested interventions to reduce mental health consequences of contagious disease outbreaks. The primary objective of the Scleroderma Patient-centered Intervention Network COVID-19 Home-isolation Activities Together (SPIN-CHAT) Trial is to evaluate the effect of a videoconference-based program on symptoms of anxiety. Secondary objectives include evaluating effects on symptoms of depression, stress, loneliness, boredom, physical activity, and social interaction. Methods The SPIN-CHAT Trial is a pragmatic RCT that will be conducted using the SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort, a sub-cohort of the SPIN Cohort. Eligible participants will be SPIN-COVID-19 Cohort participants without a positive COVID-19 test, with at least mild anxiety (PROMIS Anxiety 4a v1.0 T-score = 55), not working from home, and not receiving current counselling or psychotherapy. We will randomly assign 162 participants to intervention groups of 7 to 10 participants each or waitlist control. We will use a partially nested RCT design to reflect dependence between individuals in training groups but not in the waitlist control. The SPIN-CHAT Program includes activity engagement, education on strategies to support mental health, and mutual participant support. Intervention participants will receive the 4-week (3 sessions per week) SPIN-CHAT Program via videoconference. The primary outcome is PROMIS Anxiety 4a score immediately post-intervention. Ethics and dissemination The SPIN-CHAT Trial will test whether a brief videoconference-based intervention will improve mental health outcomes among at-risk individuals during contagious disease outbreak.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110132","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Media use and acute psychological outcomes during COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 outbreak in China led to an extraordinary threat to public health and wellbeing. This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Immediate psychological distress in quarantined patients with COVID-19 and its association with peripheral inflammation: A mixed-method study","Since the end of 2019, Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the cause of a worldwide pandemic. The mental status of patients with COVID-19 who have been quarantined and the interactions between their psychological distress and physiological levels of inflammation have yet to be analyzed. Using a mixed-method triangulation design (QUAN + QUAL), this study investigated and compared the mental status and inflammatory markers of 103 patients who, while hospitalized with mild symptoms, tested positive with COVID-19 and 103 matched controls that were COVID-19 negative. The severity of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) was measured via an on-line survey. Using a convenience sampling technique, qualitative data were collected until the point of data saturation. In addition, a semi-structured interview was conducted among five patients with COVID-19. Peripheral inflammatory markers were also collected in patients, both at baseline and within ± three days of completing the on-line survey. Results revealed that COVID-19 patients, when compared to non-COVID controls, manifested higher levels of depression (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (P < 0.001). A gender effect was observed in the score of “Perceived Helplessness”, the subscale of PSS-10, with female patients showing higher scores compared to male patients (Z = 2.56, P = 0.010), female (Z = 2.37, P = 0.018) and male controls (Z = 2.87, P = 0.004). Levels of CRP, a peripheral inflammatory indicator, correlated positively with the PHQ-9 total score (R = 0.37, P = 0.003, Spearman’s correlation) of patients who presented symptoms of depression. Moreover, the change of CRP level from baseline inversely correlated with the PHQ-9 total score (R = -0.31, P = 0.002), indicative of improvement of depression symptoms. Qualitative analysis revealed similar results with respect to patient reports of negative feelings, including fear, guilt, and helplessness. Stigma and uncertainty of viral disease progression were two main concerns expressed by COVID-19 patients. Our results indicate that significant psychological distress was experienced by hospitalized COVID-19 patients and that levels of depressive features may be related to the inflammation markers in these patients. Thus, we recommend that necessary measures should be provided to address depression and other psychiatric symptoms for COVID-19 patients and attention should be paid to patient perceived stigma and coping strategies when delivering psychological interventions.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.05.038","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A multinational, multicentre study on the psychological outcomes and associated physical symptoms amongst healthcare workers during COVID-19 outbreak","Objective Since the declaration of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak as pandemic, there are reports on the increased prevalence of physical symptoms observed in the general population. We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.049","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Adolescents' Motivations to Engage in Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Associations With Mental and Social Health","Purpose Reducing the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic prompted recommendations for individuals to socially distance. Little is known about the extent to which youth are socially distancing, what motivations underlie their social distancing, and how these motivations are connected with amount of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Using a large sample of adolescents from across the United States, this study examined adolescents' motivations for social distancing, their engagement in social distancing, and their mental and social health. Methods Data were collected on March 29th and 30th, 2020, two weeks after COVID-19 was declared a national emergency in the United States. The sample consisted of 683 adolescents recruited using social media. A series of multiple linear regressions examined unique associations among adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing, perceived amount of social distancing, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Results Almost all respondents (98.1%) reported engaging in at least a little social distancing. The most commonly reported motivations for social distancing concerned social responsibility and not wanting others to get sick. Motivations concerning state or city lockdowns, parental rules, and social responsibility were associated with greater social distancing, whereas motivations concerning no alternatives were associated with less social distancing. Specific motivations for social distancing were differentially associated with adolescents' anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Conclusions Understanding adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing may inform strategies to increase social distancing engagement, reduce pathogen transmission, and identify individual differences in mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.05.004","20200801",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Provision of Emergency Maxillofacial Service During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Collaborative Five Centre UK Study","The global pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) represents one of the greatest challenges to healthcare systems, and has forced medical specialties to rapidly adapt their approaches to patient care. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery is considered particularly at risk of disease transmission due to aerosol generation during surgical interventions, patient proximity and operating environment. On day 2 (26th March, 2020) of when severe restrictions in population movement were instigated in the United Kingdom, we began a study to prospectively monitor the presentation and management of maxillofacial emergencies at five hospital trusts. Data was collected onto an online live database fed through a smartphone application. Of the total 529 patients over six weeks, 395 attended for face-to-face consultations and 134 patients received remote consultations via telephone or video link. There were 255 trauma related cases, 221 infection and 48 cases of postoperative complications. Most trauma cases were minor soft tissue injury related to slip, trip or fall at home. There were 44 cases of facial fractures with a tendency for conservative treatment. 19 cases were related to domestic violence or self-harm. Of the 216 dental related emergencies, 68% could have been managed in the primary care setting. A quarter of all emergency patients were satisfactorily managed by remote consultations. There was a significant change in the provision of emergency maxillofacial service during the pandemic lockdown. We discuss the study findings as well as the potential implications in relation to planning for possible further COVID- 19 spikes and future pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.05.020","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact on mental health and perceptions of psychological care among medical and nursing staff in Wuhan during the 2019 novel coronavirus disease outbreak: A cross-sectional study","The severe 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first reported in Wuhan, would be expected to impact the mental health of local medical and nursing staff and thus lead them to seek help. However, those outcomes have yet to be established using epidemiological data. To explore the mental health status of medical and nursing staff and the efficacy, or lack thereof, of critically connecting psychological needs to receiving psychological care, we conducted a quantitative study. This is the first paper on the mental health of medical and nursing staff in Wuhan. Notably, among 994 medical and nursing staff working in Wuhan, 36.9% had subthreshold mental health disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 2.4), 34.4% had mild disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 5.4), 22.4% had moderate disturbances (mean PHQ-9: 9.0), and 6.2% had severe disturbance (mean PHQ-9: 15.1) in the immediate wake of the viral epidemic. The noted burden fell particularly heavily on young women. Of all participants, 36.3% had accessed psychological materials (such as books on mental health), 50.4% had accessed psychological resources available through media (such as online push messages on mental health self-help coping methods), and 17.5% had participated in counseling or psychotherapy. Trends in levels of psychological distress and factors such as exposure to infected people and psychological assistance were identified. Although staff accessed limited mental healthcare services, distressed staff nonetheless saw these services as important resources to alleviate acute mental health disturbances and improve their physical health perceptions. These findings emphasize the importance of being prepared to support frontline workers through mental health interventions at times of widespread crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.03.028","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Overdose and risk factors for coronavirus disease 2019","Background There have been significant efforts to respond to the two public health emergencies of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and overdose in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The purpose of this study was to quantify the prevalence of known risk factors associated with mortality due to COVID-19 for persons who have had a non-fatal overdose during 2015–2017 in comparison to persons who have not had an overdose. Methods Data were extracted from the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort which includes a 20 % random sample of BC residents and persons who have had a non-fatal overdose in BC from January 2015 to December 2017. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to compare risk factors by overdose history. Results Persons who had a non-fatal overdose were significantly more likely to have three (chronic pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary heart disease) of the four known chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19 compared to persons who did not have a previous non-fatal overdose event. Conclusion Persons who had an overdose were more likely to have several chronic conditions associated with the development of severe illness due to COVID-19. The increased likelihood of having these risk factors is reflective of the social and health inequities experienced by persons who have a history of overdose.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2020.108047","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Are we facing a crashing wave of neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19? Neuropsychiatric symptoms and potential immunologic mechanisms","The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is a significant psychological stressor in addition to its tremendous impact on every facet of individuals’ lives and organizations in virtually all social and economic sectors worldwide. Fear of illness and uncertainty about the future precipitate anxiety- and stress-related disorders, and several groups have rightfully called for the creation and dissemination of robust mental health screening and treatment programs for the general public and front-line healthcare workers. However, in addition to pandemic-associated psychological distress, the direct effects of the virus itself (several acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2), and the subsequent host immunologic response, on the human central nervous system (CNS) and related outcomes are unknown. We discuss currently available evidence of COVID-19 related neuropsychiatric sequelae while drawing parallels to past viral pandemic-related outcomes. Past pandemics have demonstrated that diverse types of neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as encephalopathy, mood changes, psychosis, neuromuscular dysfunction, or demyelinating processes, may accompany acute viral infection, or may follow infection by weeks, months, or longer in recovered patients. The potential mechanisms are also discussed, including viral and immunological underpinnings. Therefore, prospective neuropsychiatric monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 at various points in the life course, as well as their neuroimmune status, are needed to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, and to establish a framework for integrating psychoneuroimmunology into epidemiologic studies of pandemics.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.027","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Nowhere to hide: The significant impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) measures on elite and semi-elite South African athletes","Objectives To describe the perceptions of South African elite and semi-elite athletes on return to sport (RTS); maintenance of physical conditioning and other activities; sleep; nutrition; mental health; healthcare access; and knowledge of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Design Cross- sectional study. Methods A Google Forms survey was distributed to athletes from 15 sports in the final phase (last week of April 2020) of the level 5 lockdown period. Descriptive statistics were used to describe player demographic data. Chi-squared tests investigated significance (p <0.05) between observed and expected values and explored sex differences. Post hoc tests with a Bonferroni adjustment were included where applicable. Results 67% of the 692 respondents were males. The majority (56%) expected RTS after 1–6 months. Most athletes trained alone (61%; p <0.0001), daily (61%; p <0.0001) at moderate intensity (58%; p <0.0001) and for 30–60min (72%). During leisure time athletes preferred sedentary above active behaviour (p <0.0001). Sleep patterns changed significantly (79%; p <0.0001). A significant number of athletes consumed excessive amounts of carbohydrates (76%; p <0.0001; males 73%; females 80%). Many athletes felt depressed (52%), and required motivation to keep active (55%). Most had access to healthcare during lockdown (80%) and knew proceedings when suspecting COVID-19 (92%). Conclusions COVID-19 had physical, nutritional and psychological consequences that may impact on the safe RTS and general health of athletes. Lost opportunities and uncertain financial and sporting futures may have significant effects on athletes and the sports industry.

"Fear of COVID-19 scale: Psychometric characteristics, reliability and validity in the Israeli population","Mental health clinicians worldwide have been expressing concerns regarding the broad psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nonetheless, only a few studies have thus far evaluated the degree of fear of COVID-19, partially due to the lack of validated measures. In this study we evaluated the psychometric properties of the Hebrew version of the Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19S), recently developed to assess different aspects of the fear of the pandemic, in a normative population of participants in Israel. Participants (n = 639) were asked to complete the FCV-19S scale, as well as to report anxiety, depression, and stress levels using validated scales. The results a unidimensional factor structure of the FCV-19S which explained 53.71% of the variance. When forcing a two-factor structure model, the analysis revealed two factors pertaining to emotional fear reactions and symptomatic expressions of fear. Gender, sociodemographic status, chronic illness, being in an at-risk group, and having a family member dying of COVID-19 were positively associated with fear of COVID-19. The measure was associated with anxiety, stress and depression. These results suggest that the FCV-19S has good psychometric properties, and can be utilized in studies assessing the effects of the pandemic on the population's mental health.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113100","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals","Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management.

"Ayurveda and COVID-19: Where psychoneuroimmunology and the meaning response meet","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to high levels of psychological distress in the general public, including symptoms of anxiety and depression. Such distress is associated with alterations in immune function, including an elevated risk of viral respiratory tract infections. In this light, the possible effects of Ayurveda, a traditional system of medicine promoted by the Indian government as an “immune booster”, are examined from the point of view of psychoneuroimmune mechanisms as well as the “meaning response” described by Moerman. It was found that many of the measures advocated in their guidelines could positively influence immunity either by direct effects on symptoms of depression or anxiety, or through their symbolic significance. Therefore, it is possible that such traditional practices could be beneficial both in terms of psychological quality of life, and in terms of moderating the risk of infection.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.056","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"A longitudinal study on the mental health of general population during the COVID-19 epidemic in China","In addition to being a public physical health emergency, Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affected global mental health, as evidenced by panic-buying worldwide as cases soared. Little is known about changes in levels of psychological impact, stress, anxiety and depression during this pandemic. This longitudinal study surveyed the general population twice - during the initial outbreak, and the epidemic's peak four weeks later, surveying demographics, symptoms, knowledge, concerns, and precautionary measures against COVID-19. There were 1738 respondents from 190 Chinese cities (1210 first-survey respondents, 861 s-survey respondents; 333 respondents participated in both). Psychological impact and mental health status were assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), respectively. IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS -21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. This study found that there was a statistically significant longitudinal reduction in mean IES-R scores (from 32.98 to 30.76, p < 0.01) after 4 weeks. Nevertheless, the mean IES-R score of the first- and second-survey respondents were above the cut-off scores (>24) for PTSD symptoms, suggesting that the reduction in scores was not clinically significant. During the initial evaluation, moderate-to-severe stress, anxiety and depression were noted in 8.1%, 28.8% and 16.5%, respectively and there were no significant longitudinal changes in stress, anxiety and depression levels (p > 0.05). Protective factors included high level of confidence in doctors, perceived survival likelihood and low risk of contracting COVID-19, satisfaction with health information, personal precautionary measures.

"Do psychiatric patients experience more psychiatric symptoms during COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown? A case-control study with service and research implications for immunopsychiatry","This study aimed to assess and compare the immediate stress and psychological impact experienced by people with and without psychiatric illnesses during the peak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Seventy-six psychiatric patients and 109 healthy control subjects were recruited from Chongqing, China and completed a survey on demographic data, physical symptoms during the past 14 days and a range of psychiatric symptoms using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). IES-R measures PTSD symptoms in survivorship after an event. DASS-21 is based on tripartite model of psychopathology that comprise a general distress construct with distinct characteristics. The mean IES-R, DASS-21 anxiety, depression and stress subscale and ISI scores were higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serious worries about their physical health, anger and impulsivity and intense suicidal ideation were significantly higher in psychiatric patients than healthy controls (p < 0.05). More than one-third of psychiatric patients might fulfil the diagnostic criteria post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). More than one-quarter of psychiatric patients suffered from moderately severe to severe insomnia. Respondents who reported no change, poor or worse physical health status and had a psychiatric illness were significantly more likely to have higher mean IES-R, DASS depression, anxiety and stress subscale scores and ISI scores (p < 0.05). This study confirms the severity of negative psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 epidemic with strict lockdown measures. Understanding the psychological impact on psychiatric patients during the COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to provide insight into how to develop a new immunopsychiatry service. Further research is required to compare pro-inflammatory cytokines between psychiatric patients and healthy controls during the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2020.04.069","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Insomnia during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population","Insomnia is a major health issue associated with great psychological burden. Research of insomnia during a pandemic crisis is limited. The aim of the present study was to explore sleep difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic in a Greek population. The three-day online survey included questions about sociodemographic characteristics, contact with COVID-19 and COVID-19-related negative attitudes, as well as the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Intolerance to Uncertainty scale (IUS), the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness scale (JGLS) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) Depression Scale. Altogether, 2,427 individuals participated in the study (with 2,363 of them providing all basic demographic data). Sleep problems were detected in 37.6% of the participants. Women and people in urban areas were more vulnerable to sleep problems, while younger age showed a non-significant trend. Those uncertain about having themselves, or someone close to them contracted the virus, also demonstrated elevated insomnia scores. Lastly, according to the regression analysis, higher levels of intolerance to uncertainty, COVID-19-related worry, loneliness, as well as more severe depressive symptoms, were all predictive of insomnia. Results may be used for the development of therapeutic strategies and implementation of social policies to support people with sleep difficulties.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113076","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Frontline nurses’ burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear statuses and their associated factors during the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China: A large-scale cross-sectional study","Background During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, frontline nurses face enormous mental health challenges. Epidemiological data on the mental health statuses of frontline nurses are still limited. The aim of this study was to examine mental health (burnout, anxiety, depression, and fear) and their associated factors among frontline nurses who were caring for COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Methods A large-scale cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design was used. A total of 2,014 eligible frontline nurses from two hospitals in Wuhan, China, participated in the study. Besides sociodemographic and background data, a set of valid and reliable instruments were used to measure outcomes of burnout, anxiety, depression, fear, skin lesion, self-efficacy, resilience, and social support via the online survey in February 2020. Findings On average, the participants had a moderate level of burnout and a high level of fear. About half of the nurses reported moderate and high work burnout, as shown in emotional exhaustion (n = 1,218, 60.5%), depersonalization (n = 853, 42.3%), and personal accomplishment (n = 1,219, 60.6%). The findings showed that 288 (14.3%), 217 (10.7%), and 1,837 (91.2%) nurses reported moderate and high levels of anxiety, depression, and fear, respectively. The majority of the nurses (n = 1,910, 94.8%) had one or more skin lesions, and 1,950 (96.8%) nurses expressed their frontline work willingness. Mental health outcomes were statistically positively correlated with skin lesion and negatively correlated with self-efficacy, resilience, social support, and frontline work willingness. Interpretation The frontline nurses experienced a variety of mental health challenges, especially burnout and fear, which warrant attention and support from policymakers. Future interventions at the national and organisational levels are needed to improve mental health during this pandemic by preventing and managing skin lesions, building self-efficacy and resilience, providing sufficient social support, and ensuring frontline work willingness.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100424","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological Outcomes Associated with Stay-at-Home Orders and the Perceived Impact of COVID-19 on Daily Life","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the widespread implementation of extraordinary physical distancing interventions (e.g., stay-at-home orders) to slow the spread of the virus. Although vital, these interventions may be socially and economically disruptive, contributing to adverse psychological outcomes. This study examined relations of both stay-at-home orders and the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life to psychological outcomes (depression, health anxiety, financial worry, social support, and loneliness) in a nationwide U.S. community adult sample (N = 500; 47% women, mean age = 40). Participants completed questionnaires assessing psychological outcomes, stay-at-home order status, and COVID-19’s impact on their daily life. Being under a stay-at-home order was associated with greater health anxiety, financial worry, and loneliness. Moreover, the perceived impact of COVID-19 on daily life was positively associated with health anxiety, financial worry, and social support, but negatively associated with loneliness.

In a sample of 304 healthcare staff (doctors, nurses, radiologists, technicians, etc.), we found a sizable portion reached the cutoff levels of disorders in anxiety (28.0%), depression (30.6%), and distress (20.1%). Age, gender, education, access to PPE (personal protective equipment), healthcare institutions (public vs. private), and individual status of COVID-19 infection each predicted some but not all the outcome variables of SF-12, PHQ-4, K6, and job satisfaction. The healthcare workers varied greatly in their access to PPE and in their status of COVID-19 infection: negative (69.7%), unsure (28.0%), and positive (2.3%). The predictors were also different from those identified in previous studies of healthcare staff during the COVID-19 crisis in China.

"Preventing problematic internet use during the COVID-19 pandemic: Consensus guidance","As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments have introduced steps such as spatial distancing and “staying at home” to curb its spread and impact. The fear resulting from the disease, the ‘lockdown’ situation, high levels of uncertainty regarding the future, and financial insecurity raise the level of stress, anxiety, and depression experienced by people all around the world. Psychoactive substances and other reinforcing behaviors (e.g., gambling, video gaming, watching pornography) are often used to reduce stress and anxiety and/or to alleviate depressed mood. The tendency to use such substances and engage in such behaviors in an excessive manner as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic is considerable. Moreover, the importance of information and communications technology (ICT) is even higher in the present crisis than usual. ICT has been crucial in keeping parts of the economy going, allowing large groups of people to work and study from home, enhancing social connectedness, providing greatly needed entertainment, etc. Although for the vast majority ICT use is adaptive and should not be pathologized, a subgroup of vulnerable individuals are at risk of developing problematic usage patterns.

"COVID-19 in Wuhan: Sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on healthcare workers","Background The outbreak of COVID-19 has laid unprecedented threats and challenges to health workers (HWs) in Wuhan, China. We aimed to assess the sociodemographic characteristics and hospital support measures associated with the immediate psychological impact on HWs at Tongji Hospital in Wuhan during COVID-19 outbreak. Methods We conducted a single-center, cross-sectional survey of HWs via online questionnaires between February 8th and 10th, 2020. We evaluated stress, depression and anxiety by IES-R, PHQ-9, and GAD-7, respectively. We also designed a questionnaire to assess the perceptions of threat of COVID-19, and the satisfactions of the hospital's support measures. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to identify associated variables of acute stress, depression, and anxiety. Findings We received 5062 completed questionnaires (response rate, 77.1%). 29.8%, 13.5% and 24.1% HWs reported stress, depression and anxiety symptoms. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% CI, 0.47–0.97; p = 0.032), years of working >10 years (OR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.47–2.79; p<0.001), concomitant chronic diseases (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.27–1.80; p<0.001), history of mental disorders (OR, 3.27; 95% CI, 1.77–6.05; p<0.001), family members or relatives confirmed or suspected (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02–1.48; p = 0.03), hospital-based and department-based care (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.97; p = 0.024) and full coverage of all departments for avoiding nosocomial infection (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53–0.89; p = 0.004) were associated with stress. Interpretation Women and those who have more than 10 years of working, concomitant chronic diseases, history of mental disorders, and family members or relatives confirmed or suspected are susceptible to stress, depression and anxiety among HWs during the pandemic.

"Is returning to work during the COVID-19 pandemic stressful? A study on immediate mental health status and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of Chinese workforce","This study aimed to quantify the immediate psychological effects and psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures of a workforce returning to work during the COVID-19 epidemic. Workforce returning to work was invited to complete an online questionnaire regarding their attitude toward the COVID-19 epidemic and return-to-work along with psychological parameters including the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale- 21 (DASS-21) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures include precautions at personal and organization levels. From 673 valid questionnaires, we found that 10.8% of respondents met the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after returning to work. The respondents reported a low prevalence of anxiety (3.8%), depression (3.7%), stress (1.5%) and insomnia (2.3%). There were no significant differences in the severity of psychiatric symptoms between workers/technicians and executives/managers. >95% reported psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including good ventilation in the workplace and wore a face mask as protective. Factors that were associated with the severity of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce were marital status, presence of physical symptom, poor physical health and viewing return to work as a health hazard (p < 0.05). In contrast, personal psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures including hand hygiene and wearing face masks as well as organizational measures including significant improvement of workplace hygiene and concerns from the company were associated with less severe psychiatric symptoms (p < 0.05). Contrary to expectations, returning to work had not caused a high level of psychiatric symptoms in the workforce. The low prevalence of psychiatric symptoms could be due to confidence instilled by psychoneuroimmunity prevention measures before the resumption of work.

"Affective temperament, attachment style, and the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak: an early report on the Italian general population","The outbreak of COVID-19 is severely affecting mental health worldwide, although individual response may vary. This study aims to investigate the psychological distress perceived by the Italian general population during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to analyze affective temperament and adult attachment styles as potential mediators. Through an online survey, we collected sociodemographic and lockdown-related information and evaluated distress, temperament, and attachment using the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale (K10), the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis, Pisa, Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire short version (TEMPS-A) and the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ). In our sample (n = 500), 62% of the individuals reported no likelihood of psychological distress, whereas 19.4% and 18.6% displayed mild and moderate-to-severe likelihood. Cyclothymic (OR: 1.24; p < 0.001), depressive (OR: 1.52; p < 0.001) and anxious (OR: 1.58; p = 0.002) temperaments, and the ASQ “Need for approval” (OR: 1.08; p = 0.01) were risk factors for moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to no distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.89; p = 0.002) and “Discomfort with closeness” were protective (OR: 0.92; p = 0.001). Cyclothymic (OR: 1.17; p = 0.008) and depressive (OR: 1.32; p = 0.003) temperaments resulted as risk factors in subjects with moderate-to-severe psychological distress compared to mild distress, while the ASQ “Confidence” (OR: 0.92; p = 0.039) and “Discomfort with closeness” (OR: 0.94; p = 0.023) were protective. Our data indicated that a relevant rate of individuals may have experienced psychological distress following the COVID-19 outbreak. Specific affective temperament and attachment features predict the extent of mental health burden. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first data available on the psychological impact of the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sizeable sample of the Italian population.

"Addictovigilance contribution during COVID-19 epidemic and lockdown in France","Addictovigilance is a safety monitoring targeted at substances with potential for abuse and dependence. This vigilance was involved during the period of COVID-19 epidemic due to the significant changes in access to drugs and psychological disruption caused by the pandemic and lockdown. This article aims to present the different steps implemented by the French Addictovigilance network in collaboration with the French Health authorities from March to May 2020, including monitoring of potential harmful events, and scientific communication. The first events were identified through the continuity of the networking between the French addictovigilance centres and their partners: community pharmacies, general practitioners, specialized structures and emergency wards. As soon as the lockdown began, first cases of overdoses (lethal or not) were reported with opioids, mainly with methadone, and other opioids (heroin, oxycodone, tramadol or antitussive codeine). Lockdown-related noteworthy events consisted in clinical cases or other relevant information for which lockdown clearly played an important role: among the many substances identified at least once, pregabalin, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine and nitrous oxide were the most significant in terms of prevalence, seriousness or particularly specific to the lockdown context. Despite significant decrease in the activity and travel limited to vital needs, community pharmacies continued to identify falsified prescriptions in this period, highlighting an increase in suspicious requests for pregabalin, codeine and tramadol. In parallel, the French addictovigilance network continued its communications efforts in the period, issuing a newsletter on tramadol, a press release on methadone and naloxone, and participating in the COVID-19 frequently asked questions (FAQs) of the French Society of Pharmacology and Therapeutic website (https://sfpt-fr.org/covid19).

"Role of increasing the aerobic capacity on improving the function of immune and respiratory systems in patients with coronavirus (COVID-19): A review","Background and aims COVID-19 is a public world crisis, however, it is a self-limited infection. In COVID-19, the strength of immune and respiratory systems is a critical element. Thus, this review was conducted to demonstrate the short and long term effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on increasing the function and strength of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections and associated disorders. Methods This review was carried out by searching in Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, Medline databases. The search was conducted over clinical trials and literature and systematic reviews on the effects of increasing the aerobic capacity on the function and strength of specific immune and respiratory elements essential for overcoming COVID-19 infections. Results This review found that increasing the aerobic capacity could produce short-term safe improvements in the function of immune and respiratory systems, particularly those specific for COVID-19 infections. This could be mainly produced through three mechanisms. Firstly, it could improve immunity by increasing the level and function of immune cells and immunoglobulins, regulating CRP levels, and decreasing anxiety and depression. Secondly, it could improve respiratory system functions by acting as an antibiotic, antioxidant, and antimycotic, restoring normal lung tissue elasticity and strength. Lastly, it could act as a protective barrier to decrease COVID-19 risk factors, which helps to decrease the incidence and progression of COVID-19. Conclusion This review summarizes that increasing the aerobic capacity is recommended because it has potential of improving immune and respiratory functions which would help counter COVID-19.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.04.038","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Mental health consequences during the initial stage of the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) in Spain","The pandemic caused by Covid-19 has been an unprecedented social and health emergency worldwide. This is the first study in the scientific literature reporting the psychological impact of the Covid-19 outbreak in a sample of the Spanish population. A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 3480 people. The presence of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was evaluated with screening tests from 14 March. Sociodemographic and Covid-19-related data was collected. Additionally, spiritual well-being, loneliness, social support, discrimination and sense of belonging were assessed. Descriptive analyses were carried out and linear regression models compiled. The 18.7% of the sample revealed depressive, 21.6% anxiety and 15.8% PTSD symptoms. Being in the older age group, having economic stability and the belief that adequate information had been provided about the pandemic were negatively related to depression, anxiety and PTSD. However, female gender, previous diagnoses of mental health problems or neurological disorders, having symptoms associated with the virus, or those with a close relative infected were associated with greater symptomatology in all three variables. Predictive models revealed that the greatest protector for symptomatology was spiritual well-being, while loneliness was the strongest predictor of depression, anxiety and PTSD.

"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations associated with severe coronavirus infections: a systematic review and meta-analysis with comparison to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Before the COVID-19 pandemic, coronaviruses caused two noteworthy outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), starting in 2002, and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), starting in 2012. We aimed to assess the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases (from their inception until March 18, 2020), and medRxiv, bioRxiv, and PsyArXiv (between Jan 1, 2020, and April 10, 2020) were searched by two independent researchers for all English-language studies or preprints reporting data on the psychiatric and neuropsychiatric presentations of individuals with suspected or laboratory-confirmed coronavirus infection (SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, or SARS coronavirus 2). We excluded studies limited to neurological complications without specified neuropsychiatric presentations and those investigating the indirect effects of coronavirus infections on the mental health of people who are not infected, such as those mediated through physical distancing measures such as self-isolation or quarantine. Outcomes were psychiatric signs or symptoms; symptom severity; diagnoses based on ICD-10, DSM-IV, or the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (third edition) or psychometric scales; quality of life; and employment. Both the systematic review and the meta-analysis stratified outcomes across illness stages (acute vs post-illness) for SARS and MERS. We used a random-effects model for the meta-analysis, and the meta-analytical effect size was prevalence for relevant outcomes, I 2 statistics, and assessment of study quality. Findings 1963 studies and 87 preprints were identified by the systematic search, of which 65 peer-reviewed studies and seven preprints met inclusion criteria. The number of coronavirus cases of the included studies was 3559, ranging from 1 to 997, and the mean age of participants in studies ranged from 12·2 years (SD 4·1) to 68·0 years (single case report). Studies were from China, Hong Kong, South Korea, Canada, Saudi Arabia, France, Japan, Singapore, the UK, and the USA. Follow-up time for the post-illness studies varied between 60 days and 12 years. The systematic review revealed that during the acute illness, common symptoms among patients admitted to hospital for SARS or MERS included confusion (36 [27·9%; 95% CI 20·5–36·0] of 129 patients), depressed mood (42 [32·6%; 24·7–40·9] of 129), anxiety (46 [35·7%; 27·6–44·2] of 129), impaired memory (44 [34·1%; 26·2–42·5] of 129), and insomnia (54 [41·9%; 22·5–50·5] of 129). Steroid-induced mania and psychosis were reported in 13 (0·7%) of 1744 patients with SARS in the acute stage in one study. In the post-illness stage, depressed mood (35 [10·5%; 95% CI 7·5–14·1] of 332 patients), insomnia (34 [12·1%; 8·6–16·3] of 280), anxiety (21 [12·3%; 7·7–17·7] of 171), irritability (28 [12·8%; 8·7–17·6] of 218), memory impairment (44 [18·9%; 14·1–24·2] of 233), fatigue (61 [19·3%; 15·1–23·9] of 316), and in one study traumatic memories (55 [30·4%; 23·9–37·3] of 181) and sleep disorder (14 [100·0%; 88·0–100·0] of 14) were frequently reported. The meta-analysis indicated that in the post-illness stage the point prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder was 32·2% (95% CI 23·7–42·0; 121 of 402 cases from four studies), that of depression was 14·9% (12·1–18·2; 77 of 517 cases from five studies), and that of anxiety disorders was 14·8% (11·1–19·4; 42 of 284 cases from three studies). 446 (76·9%; 95% CI 68·1–84·6) of 580 patients from six studies had returned to work at a mean follow-up time of 35·3 months (SD 40·1). When data for patients with COVID-19 were examined (including preprint data), there was evidence for delirium (confusion in 26 [65%] of 40 intensive care unit patients and agitation in 40 [69%] of 58 intensive care unit patients in one study, and altered consciousness in 17 [21%] of 82 patients who subsequently died in another study). At discharge, 15 (33%) of 45 patients with COVID-19 who were assessed had a dysexecutive syndrome in one study. At the time of writing, there were two reports of hypoxic encephalopathy and one report of encephalitis. 68 (94%) of the 72 studies were of either low or medium quality. Interpretation If infection with SARS-CoV-2 follows a similar course to that with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, most patients should recover without experiencing mental illness. SARS-CoV-2 might cause delirium in a significant proportion of patients in the acute stage. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder, and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.

"Role of electronic media in mitigating the psychological impacts of novel coronavirus (COVID-19)","The current research initiative focuses on the role of Pakistani media in eliminating panic and depression among health practitioners and the general public due to the outbreak of novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In Pakistan, electronic media is the most common source of information due to the higher rural population and the lower literacy rate and media's handling of COVID-19 coverage so far creates panic and depression. We suggest that special televised transmissions featuring psychologists and physiatrists should be aired to reduce the panic.

"COVID-19: Psychological flexibility, coping, mental health, and wellbeing in the UK during the pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the daily lives of many people across the globe, both through the direct interpersonal cost of the disease, and the governmental restrictions imposed to mitigate its spread and impact. The UK has been particularly affected and has one of the highest mortality rates in Europe. In this paper, we examine the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and well-being in the UK during a period of ‘lockdown’ (15th–21st May 2020) and the specific role of Psychological Flexibility as a potential mitigating process. We observed clinically high levels of distress in our sample (N = 555). However, psychological flexibility was significantly and positively associated with greater wellbeing, and inversely related to anxiety, depression, and COVID-19-related distress. Avoidant coping behaviour was positively associated with all indices of distress and negatively associated with wellbeing, while engagement in approach coping only demonstrated weaker associations with outcomes of interest. No relationship between adherence to government guidelines and psychological flexibility was found. In planned regression models, psychological flexibility demonstrated incremental predictive validity for all distress and wellbeing outcomes (over and above both demographic characteristics and COVID-19-specific coping responses). Furthermore, psychological flexibility and COVID-19 outcomes were only part-mediated by coping responses to COVID-19, supporting the position that psychological flexibility can be understood as an overarching response style that is distinct from established conceptualisations of coping. We conclude that psychological flexibility represents a promising candidate process for understanding and predicting how an individual may be affected by, and cope with, both the acute and longer-term challenges of the pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.010","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The moderating roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown in Italy","The Moderating Roles of Psychological Flexibility and Inflexibility on the Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic and Lockdown in Italy. Preliminary data suggest the COVID-19 pandemic has adverse effects on mental health in approximately a quarter of the general population. Few prior studies have identified contextual risk factors and no published study has explored factors that might moderate their adverse effects on mental health. Psychological flexibility is the cornerstone of psychological health and resiliency. This study investigated the roles of psychological flexibility and inflexibility in moderating the effects of COVID-19 risk factors on three mental health outcomes: COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, anxiety, depression. We hypothesized that psychological flexibility would mitigate and psychological inflexibility would exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. During the Italian national lockdown (M = 39.29 days, SD = 11.26), 1035 adults (79% female, M = 37.5 years, SD = 12.3) completed an online survey. Twelve COVID-19 risk factors were identified (e.g. lockdown duration, family infected by COVID-19, increase in domestic violence and in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours) and constituted a COVID-19 Lockdown Index. As predicted, results showed that after controlling for sociodemographic variables, global psychological flexibility and four of its sub-processes (self-as context, defusion, values, committed action), mitigated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. In contrast and as expected, global psychological inflexibility and four of its sub-processes (lack of contact with present moment, fusion, self-as-content, lack of contact with personal values) exacerbated the detrimental impacts of COVID-19 risk factors on mental health. Findings converge with those from the broader psychological flexibility literature providing robust support for the use of ACT-based interventions to promote psychological flexibility and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.07.003","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Exploring COVID-19 stress and its factors in Bangladesh: A perception-based study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has aggregated mental health sufferings throughout the entire world. Suicide completions are the extreme consequences of COVID-19 related psychological burdens, which was reported in many countries including Bangladesh. However, there are lack of study assessing COVID-19 related human stress and its’ associations with other relevant factors affecting quality of life in the country, and which were explored in the present study. Methods An online based survey was carried out among 340 Bangladeshi adult populations (65.90% male; mean age 26.23 ± 6.39) by utilizing the socio-demographics, possible human stress due to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. Dataset were analysed through a set of statistical tools e.g., T-test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's Correlation Matrix (PCM), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Cluster Analysis (CA). Results About 85.60% of the participants are in COVID-19-related stress, which results in sleep shortness, short temper, and chaos in family. Fear of COVID-19 infection (i.e., self and/or family member(s), and/or relatives), hampering scheduled study plan and future career, and financial difficulties are identified as the main causes of human stress. Results of PCM explain the relationship among the factors of human stress, and found economic hardship and food crisis are linked together causes stress of mass people, while hamper of formal education and future plan create stress of career seeker. T-test, and one-way ANOVA illustrate demographic characteristics (i.e., occupation, age, gender, and marital status) have significant effects on elevated mental stress. Moreover, PCA and CA results revealed significant interface among the respondents’ perception and factors of human stress, which matched with the existing scenario of the country. Conclusions Considering the present findings, it is essential to introduce time-oriented policy, and implement care monitoring plans in the country, which may help in managing the pandemic as well as nurturing the public mental health to combat COVID-19 related psychological challenges.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04399","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Navigating crisis from the backseat? How top managers can support radical change initiatives by middle managers","We advance the premise that to navigate crisis, rather than reactively cutting costs by culling middle management, top managers can benefit from enabling radical change initiatives by middle managers. Contextualizing this idea to the marketing function and the COVID-19 crisis, we ask: How can Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) support marketing middle managers (MMMs) in initiating radical change in crisis situations? We take the position that marketing managers' distinctive functional influence on radical change is in driving product and service innovations that are new-to-the-firm. We then argue that crisis situations present an opportunity for top and middle managers to rethink assumptions about ‘who does what’ in radical change initiatives from the marketing function, focusing on the underemphasized possibility of MMMs initiating change and CMOs implementing. Building on recent findings on ‘change role reversal’, we unpack the notion that change initiatives may be most effective when middle managers initiate, while top managers implement. This unconventional change route would see CMOs taking a deliberate and supportive back seat in navigating crisis, while MMMs take the wheel in driving radical change initiatives. We identify duties and hurdles to a change role reversal— approach faced by MMMs throughout three stages of innovation-enabled radical change proposed by Burgelman (1991; variation-selection-retention) and chart corresponding roles that CMOs can play to support MMMs: advisor, judge, and guardian. Three tangible final questions addressed to CMOs guide managerial applications, while considerations outside scope are also discussed.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2020.05.024","20200701",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Suicidal behavior in light of COVID-19 outbreak: Clinical challenges and treatment perspectives","Objectifs La pandémie de COVID-19 touche à ce jour plus de 3 000 000 de personnes à travers le monde et les mesures de prévention ont conduit au confinement de plus de la moitié de l’humanité. La communauté scientifique et les autorités politiques redoutent une épidémie de suicides secondaires à cette crise. L’objectif de cette revue de la littérature est d’analyser l’impact de la pandémie de COVID-19 sur les dimensions du processus suicidaire, son interaction avec les différents facteurs de risque. Nous proposons également des solutions innovantes pour y remédier. Méthodes Nous avons réalisé une revue narrative des articles internationaux traitant des grandes pandémies (COVID-19, SRAS) et de leur influence sur la vulnérabilité suicidaire. Résultats De nombreux facteurs sont susceptibles de majorer l’émergence d’idées de suicide et le passage à l’acte suicidaire au cours de cette crise. La distanciation et le confinement pourraient favoriser un sentiment de déconnexion et la perception d’une douleur sociale chez les individus vulnérables. Certaines populations déjà « à risque suicidaire élevé » pourraient être encore fragilisées par la pandémie actuelle : personnes âgées, personnel médical et individus exposés à une forte précarité économique. Plusieurs solutions innovantes adaptées aux contraintes de la distanciation et du confinement permettront de prévenir le risque suicidaire : outils de santé connectée, protocole VigilanS, thérapie comportementale et cognitive de troisième vague et pratique artistique. Conclusions Il est possible que cette crise inédite exacerbe certaines dimensions du processus suicidaire. Cependant, à l’heure de l’innovation, plusieurs outils de prévention du suicide ont toute leur place dans les nouveaux modes de soins et devront être expérimentés à grande échelle. Objective The COVID-19 pandemic affected today more than 3,000,000 worldwide, and more than half of humanity has been placed in quarantine. The scientific community and the political authorities fear an epidemic of suicide secondary to this crisis. The aim of this review is to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the dimensions of the suicidal process and its interaction with the various risk factors. We also propose innovative strategies to manage suicidal behavior in the context of pandemic. Methods We carried out a narrative review of international publications dealing with major pandemics (COVID-19, SARS) and their influence on suicidal vulnerability. Results Many factors are likely to increase the emergence of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts during this crisis. Social distancing and quarantine could increase the feeling of disconnection and the perception of social pain in vulnerable individuals. Some populations at high suicidal risk could be further impacted by the current pandemic: the elderly, medical staff and individuals exposed to economic insecurity. Several innovative tools adapted to the constraints of social distancing and quarantine may prevent suicide risk: e-health, VigilanS, buddhist-derived practices and art engagement. Conclusions This unprecedented crisis may interact with certain dimensions of the suicidal process. However, it is time to innovate. Several suicide prevention tools all have their place in new modes of care and should be tested on a large scale.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.001","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"A qualitative study on the psychological experience of caregivers of COVID-19 patients","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is spreading rapidly, bringing pressure and challenges to nursing staff. Objective To explore the psychology of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients. Methods Using a phenomenological approach, we enrolled 20 nurses who provided care for COVID-19 patients in the First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology from January 20, to February 10, 2020. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or by telephone and were analysed by Colaizzi's 7-step method. Results The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarized into 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness was caused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-coping styles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, we found growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professional responsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negative emotions. Conclusions During an epidemic outbreak, positive and negative emotions of the front-line nurses interweaved and coexisted. In the early stage, negative emotions were dominant and positive emotions appeared gradually. Self-coping styles and psychological growth played an important role in maintaining mental health of nurses.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2020.03.018","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health problems faced by healthcare workers due to the COVID-19 pandemic–A review","Introduction The spread of novel corona virus (COVID-19) across the globe and the associated morbidity and mortality challenged the nations by several means. One such underrecognized and unaddressed area is the mental health issues medical staff develop during the pandemic. Materials and methods This review aimed to review the literature about mental health problems faced by health care workers (HCW) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Literature search was conducted in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Embase. All types of articles published in the last 4 months (January 2020-April 2020) which were relevant to the subject of the review were searched. A total of 23 articles were selected by initial screening and 6 articles were included in the final review. Results Review of all the 6 articles showed that current research focused on assessing several aspects of mental health affected in HCW due to COVID-19. Several sociodemographic variables like gender, profession, age, place of work, department of work and psychological variables like poor social support, self-efficacy were associated with increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, insomnia in HCW. There is increasing evidence that suggests that COVID-19 can be an independent risk factor for stress in HCW. Conclusion Regular screening of medical personnel involved in treating, diagnosing patients with COVID-19 should be done for evaluating stress, depression and anxiety by using multidisciplinary Psychiatry teams.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102119","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychopathological consequences of confinement","Les effets psychologiques de l’isolement ont déjà été décrits dans la littérature (expéditions polaires, sous-marins, prison). Néanmoins, l’échelle du confinement mis en œuvre à l’occasion de la pandémie à COVID-19 est inédite. Il nous faut non seulement relire les études publiées, mais aussi anticiper les problèmes psychologiques qui pourraient survenir pendant ou à distance du confinement. Nous avons fait le choix d’aller au-delà de la littérature COVID-19 pour examiner les implications des conséquences connues du confinement : l’ennui, l’isolement social, le stress, le manque de sommeil. L’anxiété, le trouble de stress post-traumatique, la dépression et les conduites suicidaires, les conduites addictives, les violences domestiques sont des effets décrits du confinement, mais les mécanismes d’émergence de ces troubles et leurs interrelations restent à étudier. Par exemple, quels sont les mécanismes d’émergence du trouble de stress post-traumatique dans le cadre du confinement ? Nous rappelons aussi les points de vigilance à garder sur des conséquences telles que les troubles des conduites alimentaires, les hallucinations, curieusement ignorées dans la littérature sur le confinement, alors qu’une vaste littérature fait le lien entre isolement social et hallucinations. Du fait de conséquences psychopathologiques larges, il nous faut partir à la recherche des différents symptômes pour permettre leur prise en charge. Nous résumons rapidement les approches diagnostiques et thérapeutiques déjà mises en place, comme la télémédecine, qui connaît un développement rapide à l’occasion de la crise du COVID-19. The psychological effects of isolation have already been described in the literature (polar expeditions, submarines, prison). Nevertheless, the scale of confinement implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. In addition to reviewing the published studies, we need to anticipate the psychological problems that could arise during or at a distance from confinement. We have gone beyond the COVID-19 literature in order to examine the implications of the known consequences of confinement, like boredom, social isolation, stress, or sleep deprivation. Anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicidal or addictive behaviours, domestic violence are described effects of confinement, but the mechanisms of emergence of these disorders and their interrelationships remain to be studied. For example, what are the mechanisms of emergence of post-traumatic stress disorders in the context of confinement? We also remind the reader of points of vigilance to be kept in mind with regard to eating disorders and hallucinations. Hallucinations are curiously ignored in the literature on confinement, whereas a vast literature links social isolation and hallucinations. Due to the broad psychopathological consequences, we have to look for these various symptoms to manage them. We quickly summarize the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches already in place, such as telemedicine, which is undergoing rapid development during the COVID-19 crisis.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.007","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Clinician Wellness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Extraordinary Times and Unusual Challenges for the Allergist/Immunologist","The global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused sudden and dramatic societal changes. The allergy/immunology community has quickly responded by mobilizing practice adjustments and embracing new paradigms of care to protect patients and staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 exposure. Social distancing is key to slowing contagion but adds to complexity of care and increases isolation and anxiety. Uncertainty exists across a new COVID-19 reality, and clinician well-being may be an underappreciated priority. Wellness incorporates mental, physical, and spiritual health to protect against burnout, which impairs both coping and caregiving abilities. Understanding the stressors that COVID-19 is placing on clinicians can assist in recognizing what is needed to return to a point of wellness. Clinicians can leverage easily accessible tools, including the Strength-Focused and Meaning-Oriented Approach to Resilience and Transformation approach, wellness apps, mindfulness, and gratitude. Realizing early warning signs of anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and posttraumatic stress disorder is important to access safe and confidential resources. Implementing wellness strategies can improve flexibility, resilience, and outlook.

"Health-Related Quality of Life in Common Variable Immunodeficiency Italian Patients Switched to Remote Assistance During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background A rapidly expanding pandemic of the new coronavirus has become the focus of global scientific attention. Data are lacking on the impact of the pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on health-related quality of life among patients affected by primary antibody deficiencies (PADs). Objective To identify factors impacting the health-related-quality of life (HRQOL) among Italian patients affected by PADs switched to remote assistance at the time of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Methods The quality of life was surveyed in 158 patients with PADs by the Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire, a disease-specific tool, and by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire, a generic tool to assess the risk of anxiety/depression. Since the beginning of the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic, we shifted all patients with PADs to home therapy, and activated remote visits. Questionnaires were sent by email 4 weeks later. Common Variable Immune Deficiency Quality of Life questionnaire and 12-item General Health Questionnaire data scores were compared with the same set of data from a survey done in 2017. Results Of 210 patients, 158 (75%) agreed to participate. The quality of life was worse in the group of patients who were at risk of anxiety/depression at the study time. HRQOL was similar in patients forced to shift from hospital-based to home-based immunoglobulin treatment and in patients who continued their usual home-based replacement. The risk of anxiety/depression is associated with pandemia caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 and with patients' fragility, and not with related clinical conditions associated with common variable immune deficiencies. Anxiety about running out of medications is a major new issue. Conclusions The coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic impacted HRQOL and the risk of anxiety/depression of patients with PADs. The remote assistance program was a useful possibility to limit personal contacts without influencing the HRQOL.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaip.2020.04.003","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"People experiencing homelessness: Their potential exposure to COVID-19","Background Insufficient housing quality is associated with stress and mental health impacts. Crowding, pollution, noise, inadequate lighting, lack of access to green spaces, and other environmental factors associated with slums can exacerbate mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, violence, and other forms of social dysfunction. Method The studies were identified using large-sized newspapers with international circulation. Results Experts say that people who sleep in shelters or on the streets already have lower life expectancy, suffer from addiction, and have underlying health conditions that put them at greater risk should they develop the virus. There are just so many competing and unmet needs, which makes it much harder for homeless to contend with all of this. If exposed, people experiencing homelessness might be more susceptible to illness or death due to the prevalence of underlying physical and mental medical conditions and a lack of reliable and affordable health care. Nevertheless, without an urgent solution, people experiencing homelessness will remain in limbo. Conclusions Many people living on the streets already have a diminished health condition, higher rates of chronic illnesses or compromised immune systems, all of which are risk factors for developing a more serious manifestation of the coronavirus infection. Those suffering from mental illness may have difficulty in recognizing and responding to the threat of infection. Homeless people have less access to health care providers who could otherwise order diagnostic testing and, if confirmed, isolate them from others in coordination with local health departments.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112945","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Impact Of Sars-Cov-2 And Its Reverberation In Global Higher Education And Mental Health","Background : According to UNESCO's monitoring, more than 160 countries implemented nationwide closures, which impacted over 87% of the world's student population. Several other countries implemented localized school closures; should these closures become nationwide, millions of additional learners will experience education disruption. Universities from around the world have been uncertain about how long the coronavirus crisis will last and how it might affect the mental health of students and faculty. The psychological impact has been a critical disruptor, creating anxiety and uncertainty. Method : The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : By discussing online and distance education, the coronavirus opens an important and urgent issue that affects mental health – these are virtually unexplored topics, and their results have not been validated yet. Online education is not limited to distance education, as it regards a grouping of learning/teaching procedures completed in cyberspace. Blended learning was, thus, introduced as a tool in personalized learning to adjust to new realities. These are unprecedented circumstances, and we understand they create stress, favoring anguish and a fierce search for new knowledge acquisition. Conclusions : Current research highlights that anxiety and depression, exacerbated by uncertainties and intensification of the information flow, will grow extensively. Negative physiological consequences of stress will manifest. For instance, loneliness, which will increase under these circumstances, seems to have a negative impact on education and, therefore, on psychological pain and suffering.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.112977","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Anxiety regarding contracting COVID-19 related to interoceptive anxiety sensations: The moderating role of disgust propensity and sensitivity","The COVID-19 public health crisis has led to extensive recommendations by officials to contain its spread. Anxiety regarding contracting the virus is prominent in the public. Specific routes to anxiety over disease contraction are under studied. It is expected that a contributory feature of fear of contracting COVID-19 involve disgust propensity and sensitivity, emotional reactions that are part of a broader behavioral immune system (BIS).

Participants completed measures of anxiety sensitivity, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and fear of contracting COVID-19. Results support a moderating relationship between both disgust propensity and sensitivity in the relationship between physical concerns associated with anxiety sensitivity and fear of contracting COVID-19.

D’autres facteurs de risque sont identifiés comme l’absence de soutien, la crainte de contaminer un proche, l’isolement ou la stigmatisation sociale, le haut niveau de stress au travail ou les patterns d’attachement insécure. Les soignants ont ainsi un risque augmenté d’anxiété, de dépression, d’épuisement, d’addiction et de trouble de stress post-traumatique. Conclusions Cette crise sanitaire devrait nous aider à mieux comprendre la vulnérabilité des soignants à la souffrance psychologique afin de renforcer les stratégies de prévention primaire et la formation aux enjeux psychologiques des soins, de la relation, et de la gestion des situations de crises sanitaires. Objectives The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused major sanitary crisis worldwide. Half of the world has been placed in quarantine. In France, this large-scale health crisis urgently triggered the restructuring and reorganization of health service delivery to support emergency services, medical intensive care units and continuing care units. Health professionals mobilized all their resources to provide emergency aid in a general climate of uncertainty. Concerns about the mental health, psychological adjustment, and recovery of health care workers treating and caring for patients with COVID-19 are now arising. The goal of the present article is to provide up-to-date information on potential mental health risks associated with exposure of health professionals to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature considering previous epidemics of 2003 (SARS-CoV-1) and 2009 (H1N1) with the more recent data about the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlighted most relevant data concerning the disease characteristics, the organizational factors and personal factors that may contribute to developing psychological distress and other mental health symptoms. Results The disease characteristics of the current COVID-19 pandemic provoked a generalized climate of wariness and uncertainty, particularly among health professionals, due to a range of causes such as the rapid spread of COVID-19, the severity of symptoms it can cause in a segment of infected individuals, the lack of knowledge of the disease, and deaths among health professionals. Stress may also be caused by organizational factors, such as depletion of personal protection equipment, concerns about not being able to provide competent care if deployed to new area, concerns about rapidly changing information, lack of access to up-to-date information and communication, lack of specific drugs, the shortage of ventilators and intensive care unit beds necessary to care for the surge of critically ill patients, and significant change in their daily social and family life. Further risk factors have been identified, including feelings of being inadequately supported, concerns about health of self, fear of taking home infection to family members or others, and not having rapid access to testing through occupational health if needed, being isolated, feelings of uncertainty and social stigmatization, overwhelming workload, or insecure attachment. Additionally, we discussed positive social and organizational factors that contribute to enhance resilience in the face of the pandemic. There is a consensus in all the relevant literature that health care professionals are at an increased risk of high levels of stress, anxiety, depression, burnout, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, which could have long-term psychological implications. Conclusions In the long run, this tragic health crisis should significantly enhance our understanding of the mental health risk factors among the health care professionals facing the COVID-19 pandemic. Reporting information such as this is essential to plan future prevention strategies. Protecting health care professionals is indeed an important component of public health measures to address large-scale health crisis. Thus, interventions to promote mental well-being in health care professionals exposed to COVID-19 need to be immediately implemented, and to strengthen prevention and response strategies by training health care professionals on mental help and crisis management.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.04.008","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"A cross-sectional study on mental health among health care workers during the outbreak of Corona Virus Disease 2019","The spread of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global major public health event, threatening people's physical and mental health and even life safety. This study is to investigate the psychological abnormality in health care workers battling the COVID-19 epidemic and to explore the associations among social support, resilience and mental health. A total of 1521 health care workers, of whom 147 had public health emergency experience while 1374 showed no experience, completed the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Chinese version of Connor-Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS). <U+03C7>2 test, t test and multiple regression analyses were used in statistical analysis. The results showed that people without public health emergency treatment experience showed worse performance in mental health, resilience and social support, and tended to suffer from psychological abnormality on interpersonal sensitivity and photic anxiety. This finding suggested that high levels of training and professional experience, resilience and social support were necessary to health care workers who are first taking part in public health emergence.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102111","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Epidemic of COVID-19 in China and associated Psychological Problems","The world is experiencing pandemic of the COVID-19 now, a RNA virus that spread out from Wuhan, China. Two countries, China first and later Italy, have gone to full lock down due to rapid spread of this virus. Till to date, no epidemiological data on mental health problems due to outbreak of the COVID-19 and mass isolation were not available. To meet this need, the present study was undertaken to assess the mental health status of Chinese people. An online survey was conducted on a sample of 1074 Chinese people, majority of whom from Hubei province. Lack of adequate opportunities to conduct face to face interview, anxiety, depression, mental well-being and alcohol consumption behavior were assessed via self-reported measures. Results showed higher rate of anxiety, depression, hazardous and harmful alcohol use, and lower mental wellbeing than usual ratio. Results also revealed that young people aged 21–40 years are in more vulnerable position in terms of their mental health conditions and alcohol use. To address mental health crisis during this epidemic, it is high time to implement multi-faceted approach (i.e. forming multidisciplinary mental health team, providing psychiatric treatments and other mental health services, utilizing online counseling platforms, rehabilitation program, ensuring certain care for vulnerable groups, etc.).",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102092","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A crisis within the crisis: The mental health situation of refugees in the world during the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak","Background 68.5 million people around the world have been forced to leave their houses. Refugees have mainly to face their adaption in a host country, which involves bureaucracy, different culture, poverty, and racism. The already fragile situation of refugees becomes worrying and challenged in the face of the new coronavirus (COVID-19) epidemic. Therefore, we aimed to describe the factors that can worsen the mental health of refugees. Method The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results According to the literature, the difficulties faced by refugees with the COVID-19 pandemic are potentiated by the pandemic state. There are several risk factors common to coronavirus and psychiatric illnesses as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation, lack of access to shelter, health care, public services, and safety. These associated with fear and uncertainty create a closed ground for psychological sickness and COVID-19 infection.

"When health professionals look death in the eye: the mental health of professionals who deal daily with the 2019 coronavirus outbreak","Background : The fact that COVID-19 is transmissible from human to human and associated with high morbidity and potentially fatality can intensify the perception of personal danger. In addition, the foreseeable shortage of supplies and an increasing flow of suspected and real cases of COVID-19 contribute to the pressures and concerns of health professionals. Method : The studies were identified in well-known international journals found in two electronic databases: Scopus and Embase. The data were cross-checked with information from the main international newspapers. Results : Work-related stress is a potential cause of concern for health professionals. It has been associated with anxiety including multiple clinical activities, depression in the face of the coexistence of countless deaths, long work shifts with the most diverse unknowns and demands in the treatment with patients with COVID-19. Therefore, it is an important indicator of psychic exhaustion. Conclusions : As coronavirus cases increase and deaths surge in Italy, new figures show an ""enormous"" level of contagion among the country's medical personnel. At least 2,629 health workers have been infected with coronavirus since the outbreak onset in February, representing 8.3% of total cases. The percentage of infected health workers has almost doubled the number registered in China throughout the epidemic.

"Mental health care in French correctional facilities during the Covid-19 pandemic","Objectif En France, les mesures de confinement ont été accompagnées de dispositions spécifiques pour les prisons : suspension des activités, parloirs et interventions extérieures. Plus de dix mille personnes détenues ont en outre été libérées pour diminuer le taux d’occupation des établissements et limiter la propagation du virus. L’objectif de cet article est de décrire la réorganisation des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire en contexte de pandémie de Covid-19 et d’interroger les conséquences du confinement et des libérations anticipées sur la santé mentale des personnes détenues. Méthode Ce travail s’appuie sur une enquête menée en avril 2020 auprès des soignants de 42 unités sanitaires en milieu pénitentiaire et des 9 unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées en France. Une synthèse de la littérature internationale sur la question des soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire durant l’épidémie de Covid-19 a également été réalisée. Résultats L’épidémie de Covid-19 semble avoir été plutôt contenue dans les prisons françaises au cours de la période de confinement mais le poids des mesures mises en place sur la population carcérale est important. Les 3 niveaux de soins psychiatriques en milieu pénitentiaire ont instauré des mesures spécifiques pour assurer la continuité des soins, accompagner les personnes incarcérées et contenir l’épidémie. Parmi les plus importantes, on note la restriction des consultations, la création de « secteurs Covid », la déprogrammation des hospitalisations non urgentes, le renforcement des mesures d’hygiène et le remaniement des effectifs. Actuellement, les soignants sont principalement confrontés à des sevrages forcés, des symptomatologies anxieuses et des décompensations de troubles psychiatriques chroniques. Certaines libérations anticipées sont aussi très préoccupantes, pouvant entraîner des ruptures de soins, par manque de préparation des relais de prise en charge. Discussion Les remaniements en lien avec le confinement donnent une visibilité accrue au fossé qui sépare la psychiatrie en milieu libre de la psychiatrie en milieu pénitentiaire. Il nous apparaît important de rappeler la vulnérabilité des personnes incarcérées qui doivent impérativement être considérées dans les politiques de santé publique. Objective The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the 11 million people currently incarcerated worldwide is the subject of many concerns. Prisons and jails are filled with people suffering from many preexisting medical conditions increasing the risk of complications. Detainees’ access to medical services is already limited and overcrowding poses a threat of massive contagion. Beyond the health impact of the crisis, the tightening of prison conditions worries. On March 16, 2020, in France, the lockdown measures have been accompanied by specific provisions for prisons: all facilities have suspended visitations, group activities and external interventions. Over 10,000 prisoners have been released to reduce the prison population and the risk of virus propagation. These adjustments had major consequences on the healthcare system in French prisons. The objectives of this article are to describe the reorganization of the three levels of psychiatric care for inmates in France in the context of Covid-19 pandemic and to have a look at the impact of lockdown measures and early releases on mental health of prisoners. Methods This work is based on a survey conducted in April 2020 in France among psychiatric healthcare providers working in 42 ambulatory units for inmates and in the 9 full-time inpatient psychiatric wards exclusively for inmates called “UHSAs” (which stands for “unités hospitalières spécialement aménagées”, and can be translated as “specially equipped hospital units”). A review of the international literature on mental healthcare system for inmates during the Covid-19 epidemic has also been performed. Results The Covid-19 epidemic has been rather contained during the period of confinement in French prisons but the impact of confinement measures on the prison population is significant. The three levels of psychiatric care for inmates have implemented specific measures to ensure continuity of care, to support detainees during Coronavirus lockdown and to prevent an infection's spread. Among the most important are: limitation of medical consultations to serious and urgent cases, creation of “Covid units”, cancellation of voluntary psychiatric hospitalizations, reinforcement of preventive hygiene measures and reshuffling of medical staff. Prolonged confinement has consequences on mental health of detainees. Currently, mental health workers are facing multiple clinical situations such as forced drug and substance withdrawal (linked to difficulties in supplying psychoactive substances), symptoms of anxiety (due to concerns for their own and their relatives’ well-being) and decompensation among patients with severe psychiatric conditions. Early releases from prison may also raise some issues. People recently released from prison are identified as at high risk of death by suicide and drug overdose. The lack of time to provide the necessary link between health services within prisons and health structures outside could have serious consequences, emphasizing the well-known “revolving prison doors” effect. Discussion The current lockdown measures applied in French jails and prisons point out the disparities between psychiatric care for inmates and psychiatric care for general population. Giving the high vulnerability of prison population, public health authorities should pay more attention to health care in prisons.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.002","20200601",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Ensuring mental health care during the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in France: A narrative review","Objectif L’absence de préparation du système de soins psychiatriques à l’épidémie de virus SARS-CoV-2 fait redouter fait redouter un scénario pessimiste pour la santé physique et mentale des patients suivis en psychiatrie. L’objectif de cet article est de proposer des éléments de guidance pour réorganiser les soins psychiatriques dans le contexte de pandémie Covid-19. Méthode Les auteurs ont réalisé une synthèse de la littérature internationale combinée au partage des expériences locales françaises. Résultats Les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques semblent particulièrement vulnérables à ce virus et à la pandémie : vulnérabilités liées aux comorbidités médicales, à l’âge, aux troubles cognitifs qui peuvent entraver le respect des consignes de confinement et aux complications psychosociales. Plusieurs initiatives ont été prises pour assurer la continuité des soins et contenir l’épidémie : création en psychiatrie d’unité Covid+ co-supervisée par des médecins généralistes ou internistes, restriction des consultations aux cas sévères et redéploiement des soins en téléconsultation, accompagnement de type case-management pour les sorties précoces ou l’impossibilité d’hospitaliser, accompagnements spécifiques pour les complications psychiques du confinement. Les populations suivies en pédopsychiatrie, en psychiatrie du sujet âgé, en addictologie ou détenues en prison doivent bénéficier d’une attention particulière. Plusieurs questions restent en suspend : la question de l’interaction négative ou positive des traitements sur l’infection SARS-CoV-2, l’épidémiologie de l’infection chez les personnes souffrant de troubles psychiques, leur adaptation à un confinement long. Discussion Une prise de conscience par les décideurs politiques de la grande vulnérabilité de ces populations et des institutions psychiatriques dans cette situation de catastrophe sanitaire est urgente. Objective The lack of ressources and coordination to face the epidemic of coronavirus raises concerns for the health of patients with mental disorders in a country where we keep in memory the dramatic experience of famine in psychiatric hospitals during the Second World War. This article aims at proposing guidance to ensure mental health care during the SARS-CoV epidemy in France. Methods Authors performed a narrative review identifying relevant results in the scientific and medical literature and local initiatives in France. Results We identified four types of major vulnerabilities in patients suffering from mental disorders during this pandemic: (1) medical comorbidities that are more frequently found in patients suffering from mental disorders (cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies, diabetes, obesity, etc.) which represent risk factors for severe infections with Covid-19; (2) age (the elderly constituting the population most vulnerable to coronavirus); (3) cognitive and behavioral troubles which can hamper compliance with confinement and hygiene measures and finally and (4) psychosocial vulnerability due to stigmatization and/or socio-economic difficulties. Furthermore, the mental health healthcare system is more vulnerable than other healthcare systems. Current government plans are poorly adapted to psychiatric establishments in a context of major shortage of organizational, material and human resources. In addition, a certain number of structural aspects make the psychiatric institution particularly vulnerable: many beds are closed, wards have a high density of patients, mental health community facilities are closed, medical teams are understaffed and poorly trained to face infectious diseases. We could also face major issues in referring patients with acute mental disorders to intensive care units. To maintain continuity of psychiatric care in this pandemic situation, several directions can be considered, in particular with the creation of Covid+ units. These units are under the dual supervision of a psychiatrist and of an internist/infectious disease specialist; all new entrants should be placed in quarantine for 14 days; the nurse staff should benefit from specific training, from daily medical check-ups and from close psychological support. Family visits would be prohibited and replaced by videoconference. At the end of hospitalization, in particular for the population of patients in compulsory ambulatory care situations, specific case-management should be organized with the possibility of home visits, in order to support them when they get back home and to help them to cope with the experience of confinement, which is at risk to induce recurrences of mental disorders. The total or partial closure of mental health community facilities is particularly disturbing for patients but a regular follow-up is possible with telemedicine and should include the monitoring of the suicide risk and psychoeducation strategies; developing support platforms could also be very helpful in this context. Private psychiatrists have also a crucial role of information with their patients on confinement and barrier measures, but also on measures to prevent the psychological risks inherent to confinement: maintenance of sleep regularity, physical exercise, social interactions, stress management and coping strategies, prevention of addictions, etc. They should also be trained to prevent, detect and treat early warning symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, because their prevalence was high in the regions of China most affected by the pandemic.

"Demographics and self-reported well-being of Brazilian adults as a function of pet ownership: A pilot study","The goals of the present study were to investigate socio-demographic characteristics and well-being indicators associated with pet ownership. The respondents (N = 801, 53.8% females; 56.2% with children) came from the five macro-regions of Brazil (8% North, 28% Northeast, 36% Southeast, 18% South, 10% Central-West). Their ages ranged from 20 to 50 years. Over half of the sample (60%) reported living with a pet. Logistic regression showed that residence type (to be owner versus renter) and parental status (to be childless versus to have children) were predictors of pet ownership. We found interaction between pet ownership and sex on well-being indicators: the Mann-Whitney test showed that men who owned a pet reported better sleep quality, better relationship with neighbors and less sadness; whereas women who owned a pet reported lower life organization. With respect to life satisfaction, no differences were found between pet owners and non-pet owners. Implications of our findings and new research directions are discussed.

"Respiratory rehabilitation in elderly patients with COVID-19: A randomized controlled study","Background Different degrees of disorders are reported in respiratory function, physical function and psychological function in patients with corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19), especially in elderly patients. With the experience of improved and discharged COVID-19 patients, timely respiratory rehabilitation intervention may improve prognosis, maximize functional preservation and improve quality of life (QoL), but there lacks of studies worldwide exploring the outcome of this intervention. Objective To investigate the effects of 6-week respiratory rehabilitation training on respiratory function, QoL, mobility and psychological function in elderly patients with COVID-19. Methods This paper reported the findings of an observational, prospective, quasi-experimental study, which totally recruited 72 participants, of which 36 patients underwent respiratory rehabilitation and the rest without any rehabilitation intervention. The following outcomes were measured: pulmonary function tests including plethysmography and diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), functional tests (6-min walk distance test), Quality of life (QoL) assessments (SF-36 scores), activities of daily living (Functional Independence Measure, FIM scores), and mental status tests (SAS anxiety and SDS depression scores). Results After 6 weeks of respiratory rehabilitation in the intervention group, there disclosed significant differences in FEV1(L), FVC(L), FEV1/FVC%, DLCO% and 6-min walk test. The SF-36 scores, in 8 dimensions, were statistically significant within the intervention group and between the two groups. SAS and SDS scores in the intervention group decreased after the intervention, but only anxiety had significant statistical significance within and between the two groups. Conclusions Six-week respiratory rehabilitation can improve respiratory function, QoL and anxiety of elderly patients with COVID-19, but it has little significant improvement on depression in the elderly.",NA,"https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2020.101166","20200501",NA,"Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Depression symptoms mediate mismatch between perceived severity of the COVID-19 and diminished compliance with prevention measures","Without any known vaccine or cure, sustaining individuals’ cooperation in following prevention measures is crucial to prevent spreading of the coronavirus (COVID-19). Here, we monitored national representative samples with changes in beliefs about the pandemic, depressive symptoms, and motivation to comply with prevention measures between the end of the first wave (Time1) and beginning of the second wave (Time2) of the COVID-19 in South Korea. Participants’ beliefs about the pandemic closely reflected the change of the COVID-19 situations. Strikingly, inconsistent with the accurate belief update, individuals regarded social distancing less important and externalized their motives to comply with preventive measures more at Time2 than Time1. This mismatch was mediated by depressive symptoms, such that increased depressive symptoms followed by negative belief change were associated with decreased perceived importance of social distancing and voluntary motivation. Our data highlights the importance of considering psychological reactions in promoting individuals’ compliance with prevention measures.","Jiwon Park et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460BE-CD1-974","20200729","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; depression; covid-19; belief; social distancing","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Resilience contributes to low emotional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in Italy","Background The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences. The Italian Government has implemented a massive lockdown to decrease the spread of the virus. Although a strong psychological impact is possible, few evidences are still available. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress promoting mental health. For these reasons, this study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterizing by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. Methods A total sample of 6314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 10 and May 4 2020 through an online survey, the majority of whom from Northern Italy. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) (a measure of mental health status) and the Resilience Scale (RS) (a measure of resilience) were administered. Also, demographic data and lockdown related information were collected. DASS-21 cut-off scores were used to verify the mental status among the participants. Subsequently, a correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between DASS-21 and RS. Lastly, three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the three DASS-21 scales as dependent variables and the RS scales as independent variables controlling for age, gender, and education. Results The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 36.1% for depression, 28.7% for anxiety, and 35.6% for stress. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that all the resilience factors were statistically significant in predicting anxiety, while meaningfulness, perseverance, existential aloneness, and equanimity predicted depression and stress. Conclusions During the lockdown following the COVID-19 outbreak, about a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychological interventions to enhance resilience might provide useful approaches to overcome COVID-related emotional impact.","Vittorio Lenzo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-344-7DB","20200801","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; clinical psychology; depression; dass-21; resilience; anxiety; covid-19; stress; resilience scale","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COnVida-20(1)","An increasing number of studies have addressed the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in the general population. Nevertheless, far less is known about the impact in specific populations such as university students, whose psychological vulnerability has been shown in previous research. This study sought to examine different indicators of mental health in university students during the Spanish lockdown; we also analyzed the main sources of stress perceived by students in relation to the COVID-19 crisis, and the coping strategies adopted when faced with the situation. Data was collected from 932 students (704 women) through a web-based platform. Measures of anxiety (i.e., GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), irritability and self-perceived change in mental health were administered, as well as ad hoc measures of stressors and coping strategies. Results indicated that students experienced considerable psychological problems during the confinement, with higher rates of emotional difficulties in women and undergraduate students than in men and postgraduates, respectively. Psychological distress was mainly related to several specific domains of stressors, as perceived by the participants: academic future, task overload, worsening of interpersonal conflicts, and restrictions in pleasant social contact; and far less related to the spread of the disease and its consequences for physical health. As regards coping strategies, both reframing skills and daily routines were shown to be the most effective. A path-analysis model integrating stressors, coping, and mental health revealed that coping strategies partially channeled the effect of stressors on psychological health. In general, results suggest that students’ psychological health was substantially affected by the COVID-19 situation and that the academic and relational changes were the most notable sources of stress. This study reinforces the need to monitor and promote mental health in university students to boost resilience in times of crisis. Our results on effective coping strategies may inform preventive programs aimed at helping students to deal with challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Isabel Padrón et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-A5C-11A","20200731","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; covid-19; psychological impact; coping; stressors; university students; convida-20.","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Hazardous Workplace, Work-related Stress, and Unhealthy Behaviors among Healthcare Workers: The Relationships with Depressive and Insomnia symptoms during COVID-19","We aimed to investigate the relationship between mental health problems and unhealthy behaviors among healthcare workers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Using an online survey, we collected data on healthcare workers’ consideration of their work unit as hazardous. Furthermore, workers’ depression, insomnia, and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Insomnia Severity Index, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale, respectively. Healthcare workers’ work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic were measured using the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic - 9 (SAVE-9) scale. As a result, work-related stress and anxiety in response to the viral epidemic was related to being female, to regarding one's work as a dangerous workplace, and depressive symptoms. Unhealthy behaviors, such as smoking and drinking as coping behaviors during the pandemic, were related to being male, young, experiencing depression, and having insomnia. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to closely observe the patterns of work-related stress and anxiety reactions among healthcare workers to reduce their burnout.","Ju Kab Lee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46057-70E-E8B","20201007","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; health personnel; occupational stress; save-9; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"When Social Interaction Backfires: Frequent Social Interaction during the COVID-19 Pandemic Period Is Associated with Decreased Well-Being and Higher Panic Buying","The present research investigated a backfiring effect of social interaction on well-being and general confidence in Western populations during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Across two studies, we observed that stronger self-other connectedness and frequent social communication with others during the first few weeks into the quarantine period led to worsened well-being and decreased general confidence. In study 1 (n = 331), we showed that people who reported higher social connectedness and more frequent social interaction experienced declined well-being. In study 2 (n = 327), we replicated the backfiring effect and showed that those who engaged in frequent social interaction, especially in COVID-19 related conversations, reported decreased general confidence, which mediated the accelerating effect of social interaction on panic buying. Overall, our findings indicated that frequent social interaction under a highly novel and uncertain crisis can induce negative consequences on mental health and behavior.","Hyunji Kim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603C-63E-D8A","20200703","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology|Consumer Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self and Social Identity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; well-being; social interaction; panic buying; general confidence level; self-other connectedness; word-of-mouth; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Application of the Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemic-6 (SAVE-6) and Coronavirus Anxiety scales (CAS) to measure cancer patient anxiety in response to the COVID-19","This study investigated the usefulness of the 6-item Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics (SAVE-6) scale and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS) as tools to assess anxiety related to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in cancer patients. A total of 221 patients with cancer responded to an anonymous online questionnaire between July 15 and August 15, 2020. The functional impairment of the patients was assessed using the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS), and the SAVE-6 and CAS were also applied. Among these 221 cancer patients, 110 (49.8%) had SAVE-6 scores =15 and 21 (9.5%) had CAS scores =5. Within the study population, 104 (47.1%) and 29 (13.1%) patients had WSAS scores =11 (moderate to severe functional impairment) and =21 (severe functional impairment), respectively. The correlations between the SAVE-6 and WSAS (p < 0.001) and CAS (p < 0.001) scores were statistically significant. The cut-off for the SAVE-6 was 15 points, while that for the WSAS was 11. Our results suggested that the SAVE-6 and CAS could be used to evaluate moderate and severe degrees of functional impairment related to mental health, respectively, in cancer patients during viral epidemics.","Myung Hee Ahn et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460E4-66C-75C","20200909","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; anxiety; mental health; cancer","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Psychological Impact of Threat & Lockdown During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objectives This study aimed to investigate the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health, particularly the effects of perceived threat and lockdown measures, and to elucidate individual and social factors exacerbating or mitigating its negative effects, particularly sense of control. Design An online survey was designed including questions about psychological wellbeing, lockdown behaviours, and perceived COVID-19 threat, risk, and knowledge. Methods Individuals (N=8,229; 39.4% male, 59.4% female, 1.1% other, Mage=38.3, SD=13.5, range = 18-88) were recruited in 79 countries via the snowballing method and social media, and completed the survey in March-April 2020. Results Participant showed elevated levels of anxiety and depression during early stages of lockdown, predicted by perceived threat. Feelings of social isolation moderated the effect of threat on depression symptoms, and increased with the duration of quarantine, but was mitigated by frequent communication with close others. Sense of control was predicted negatively by maladaptive coping, but positively by adaptive coping and the perception that the government is dealing with the outbreak. Individual actions to avoid contracting the virus were associated with higher anxiety, except when done professionally by essential workers. Conclusions We suggest that the psychological detrimental effects of the pandemic – following perceived threat and lockdown measures – can be alleviated by individual actions such as maintaining frequent social contact and adaptive coping, and by governmental actions which demonstrate support in a public health crisis. Citizens and governments can work together to adapt better to restrictive but necessary measures during the current and future pandemics.","Valerie Van Mulukom et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4617A-B65-F7C","20200722","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; government; sense of control; psychological well-being; lockdown; quarantine; anxiety; covid-19; survey; psychology; coronavirus; social isolation; depression; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Who Bought All the Toilet Paper? Conspiracy Theorists Are More Likely to Stockpile During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The current COVID-19 pandemic has changed many people’s lives. Some people have responded to the rising of the pandemic by engaging in panic buying behaviors, a phenomenon that has not been well-understood in the past. People who believe in these conspiracies may experience a heightened sense of powerlessness and vulnerability. As a result, they may be particularly susceptible to palliatively and compensatorily engage in the panic buying behaviors (i.e., stockpiling). Supporting this idea, two studies using data from the U.K. (cross-sectional) and the U.S. (longitudinal) show that people who endorse COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to engage in stockpiling behaviors in the past as well as in the future.","Max Hui Bai","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46157-536-B22","20200702","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"A Person-Centered Approach to Profiling COVID-Related Experiences in the United States: Preliminary Findings from the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII)","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on individuals, families, and communities around the world. Intensive health precautions have created constraints on mobility, work, education, family life, and interpersonal relationships. Preliminary survey studies have reported an increase in the prevalence and severity of psychosocial impairments in the pandemic’s immediate wake. However, the impact of specific pandemic-related experiences and patterns of experiences has not been systematically assessed and studied. The goal of the present study was to develop and conduct a preliminary empirical test of a novel, comprehensive assessment of pandemic-related experiences, the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII), using person-centered latent class analysis (LCA). Aims were to (1) test the hypothesis that LCA would identify unique subgroups based on patterns of negative and positive pandemic-related experiences across personal and social domains, and (2) examine whether identified subgroups would significantly differ on sociodemographic characteristics and indicators of mental health and functioning. Results supported hypotheses, with several unique subgroups identified across domains that were differentiated on sociodemographic characteristics and measures of perceived stress, depression, anxiety, PTSD, and perceived social support. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This study, combined with future research with the EPII, may serve to inform public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the current pandemic and under similar mass public health crisis circumstances in the future.","Damion Grasso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A1-77D-707","20200701","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; pandemic; epidemic; mental health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Change in Mental Health Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Appraisals and Daily Life Experiences","Intro: When confronted with major threats such as the COVID-19 pandemic, people often experience (temporary) decline in well-being. The central purpose of this study was to identify mechanisms underlying stability and change of well-being in times of threat like the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined change in mental health symptoms and its relationships with appraisals of the pandemic and daily life experiences during the pandemic, including affective states, stress, and mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a study across 3.5 weeks, including pretest, posttest, and a diary phase in-between. In this report, we worked with a sample of 460 adults, pre- and post-test information, as well as a total of 7189 observations from the diary phase. Results: Results showed that less fortunate change in mental health symptoms across three weeks was predicted by more negative affect and less mindfulness, specifically less attention to the present moment, in daily life. Furthermore, less fortunate change in mental health symptoms was correlated with change towards less fortunate appraisals of the appraisals. Finally, we showed that more general views of the pandemic (i.e., appraisals) were interrelated to experiences in daily life, with more negative appraisals of the pandemic predicting more negative affect and stressor occurrence as well as less mindfulness. Discussion: These findings speak to the dynamic nature of well-being and appraisals in times of threat, and they show how experiences in daily life matter for change in well-being","Annette Brose et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46234-9E1-68B","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; well-being; covid-19; stress; mental health; ambulatory assessment; affect; mindfulness","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Nature, Cause and Consequence of COVID-19 Panic among Social Media Users in India","Aims The recent pandemic of COVID-19 has not only shaken the healthcare but also economic structure around the world. In addition to these direct effects, it has also brought in some indirect difficulties owing to the information epidemic on social media. As India experienced a later outbreak of COVID-19 and a prolonged uninterrupted lockdown, we aimed to understand the nature of panic social media users in India are experiencing due to the flow of (mis)information. We further extend this investigation to other countries. Methods We performed a cross-sectional study by conducting survey on multiple social media platforms. We received 1075 responses (sex ratio 2:1) through opportunity sampling from social media users of 30 different countries (between April 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020). We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses on the 935 respondents from India. Several hypotheses are statistically tested on them and are further examined on rest of the 140 social media users from 29 other countries. We also performed a separate Twitter hashtag analysis and sentiment analysis on the responses. We applied a citizen science approach to involve the respondents in the analysis pipeline after the survey. Results This cross-sectional study on 1075 social media users from India and 29 other countries revealed a significant increase of social media usage and rise of panic over time in India. Middle-aged people and female exhibit a higher panic in India. The amount of panic was independent of the nature of association with COVID-19. The change of mental health was associated with panic level and productivity. Further qualitative analysis highlights the occurrences of information panic, economic panic, moral panic and spiritual panic, among other causes. Conclusions Several panic behaviors are unique to social media users in India possibly because COVID-19 broke out relatively later in comparison with the other countries and the uninterrupted lockdown prolonged for a long time. The amount of social media usage might not be causal but has a significant role in generating panic among the people in India. A significantly higher level of panic among the middle-aged people can be attributed to their higher amount of responsibility. The popularity of different hashtags, including the names of drugs under trial for COVID-19, in limited countries highlight that the causes of panic are not the same everywhere. As some of the respondents took part as citizen scientists a robust perspective to the outcome is obtained.","Chandrima Bhattacharya et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-9EA-D12","20200727","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; mental health; social media; covid-19; anxiety; panic","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Twitter and Census Data Analytics to Explore Socioeconomic Factors for Post-COVID-19 Reopening Sentiment","Investigating and classifying sentiments of social media users (e.g., positive, negative) towards an item, situation, and system are very popular among the researchers. However, they rarely discuss the underlying socioeconomic factor associations for such sentiments. This study attempts to explore the factors associated with positive and negative sentiments of the people about reopening the economy, in the United States (US) amidst the COVID-19 global crisis. It takes into consideration the situational uncertainties (i.e., changes in work and travel pattern due to lockdown policies), economic downturn and associated trauma, and emotional factors such as depression. To understand the sentiment of the people about the reopening economy, Twitter data was collected, representing the 51 states including Washington DC of the US. State-wide socioeconomic characteristics of the people (e.g., education, income, family size, and employment status), built environment data (e.g., population density), and the number of COVID-19 related cases were collected and integrated with Twitter data to perform the analysis. A binary logit model was used to identify the factors that influence people toward a positive or negative sentiment. The results from the logit model demonstrate that family households, people with low education levels, people in the labor force, low-income people, and people with higher house rent are more interested in reopening the economy. In contrast, households with a high number of members and high income are less interested to reopen the economy. The accuracy of the model is good (i.e., the model can correctly classify 56.18\% of the sentiments). The Pearson chi2 test indicates that overall this model has high goodness-of-fit. This study provides a clear indication to the policymakers where to allocate resources and what policy options they can undertake to improve the socioeconomic situations of the people and mitigate the impacts of pandemics in the current situation and as well as in the future.","Mokhlesur Rahman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4616E-F5C-0B1","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Media Consumption and Mental Health during COVID-19 lockdown: A UK Cross-sectional study across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern","As individuals adjust to new ‘norms’ and ways of living during the COVID-19 lockdown, there is a continuing need for up-to-date information and guidance. This has elevated the importance of media channels, such as social media and traditional media. Evidence suggests that frequent media exposure is related to a higher prevalence of mental health problems, especially anxiety and depression. The aim of this study is to determine whether COVID-19 related media consumption is associated with changes in mental health outcomes. This paper presents baseline data from the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study. The results showed a statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 media exposure and increases in anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The study suggested that media usage is statistically significantly associated with anxiety and depression on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales with excessive media exposure related to higher anxiety and depression scores.","Ruth Neill et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460F8-B20-1EF","20200701","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; depression; mental health; covid-19; media consumption; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Perceived stress and insomnia under the period of COVID-19: The mediating role of sense of security and the moderating role of family cohesion","Although perceived stress has been shown to play an important role in insomnia, little is known about the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying this relation. In particular, the outbreak of COVID-19 has undoubtedly had a significant impact on the physical and mental health of college students. The present study focused on Chinese college students during the COVID-19 pandemic and examined the mediating role of sense of security between perceived stress and insomnia and the moderating role of family cohesion. Chinese college students (N = 1,187) completed the measures of perceived stress, sense of security, insomnia, and family cohesion. The results indicated that perceived stress was significantly and positively associated with insomnia, and sense of security partially mediated this relation. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that family cohesion moderated the relation between perceived stress and sense of security. This relation became weaker for college students with higher levels of family cohesion. Results highlight the significance of identifying the mechanisms that moderate the mediate paths between perceived stress and college students’ insomnia.","Baojuan Ye et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46136-73E-BBC","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; sense of security; covid-19; insomnia; family cohesion; perceived stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Coping with Health Threats: The costs and benefits of managing emotions","How people respond to health threats can influence their own health and, when facing communal risks, even their community's health. We propose that people commonly respond to health threats by managing their emotions with cognitive strategies like reappraisal, which can reduce fear and protect mental health. However, because fear can also motivate health behaviors, reducing fear may also jeopardize health behaviors. In two diverse U.S. samples (N=1,241) tracked across three months, sequential and cross-lag panel mediation models indicated that reappraisal predicted lower fear about an ongoing health threat (COVID-19), and in turn, better mental health, but fewer recommended physical health behaviors. This trade-off was not inevitable, however: using reappraisal to increase socially-oriented positive emotions predicted better mental health without jeopardizing physical health behaviors. Examining the costs and benefits of how people cope with health threats is essential for promoting better health outcomes for individuals and communities.","Angela Moriah Smith et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614A-DE4-685","20201020","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; positive emotions; reappraisal; emotion regulation; fear; health behaviors; mental health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Relationships between Nutrition and Physical Activity, and the Symptoms of Insomnia, Depression and Anxiety among Adolescents in South China During COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has caused mental health issues among adolescents. This study aimed to explore the related factors of nutrition, physical activity (PA), and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety, and to investigate associations between the two lifestyle behaviors (insolated or combined) with symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Cross-sectional data of 1,756 middle school students from a survey conducted in May 2020 was used. The t-tests or c2 tests were used to determine the related factors of nutrition, PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety across the subgroups when appropriate. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the relationships between nutrition and PA, and symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Girls, rural students, left-behind, sibling, students with low family income or excessive fear had worse lifestyle or mental status. Both poor nutrition and inactive PA were related to higher odds of reporting symptoms of insomnia, depression and anxiety. Students with both poor nutrition and inactive PA tended to report insomnia symptoms (OR = 2.16) and depressive symptoms (OR = 2.57) than those with only one behavior or neither of them after controlling for confounding factors. The present study indicates the importance of helping adolescents to pursue a healthier lifestyle.","Xinli Chi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461D0-373-450","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Alarming levels of psychiatric symptoms and the role of loneliness during the COVID-19 epidemic: A case study of Hong Kong","Public health strategies to curb the spread of the coronavirus involve sheltering at home and social distancing are effective in reducing the transmission rate, but the unintended consequences of prolonged social isolation on mental health have not been investigated. We focused on Hong Kong for its very rapid and comprehensive response to the pandemic and strictly enacted social distancing protocols. Thus, Hong Kong is a model case for the population-wide practice of effective social distancing and provides an opportunity to examine the impact of loneliness on mental health during the COVID-19. We conducted an anonymous online survey of 432 residents in Hong Kong to examine psychological distress in the community. The results indicate a dire situation with respect to mental health. An astonishing 65.6% (95% C.I. = [60.6%, 70.4%]) of the respondents reported clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and/or stress. Moreover, 22.5% (95% C.I. = [18.2%, 27.2%]) of the respondents were showing signs of psychosis risk. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not social network size, were associated with increased psychiatric symptoms. To mitigate the potential epidemic of mental illness in the near future, there is an urgent need to prepare clinicians, caregivers and stakeholders to focus on loneliness.","Ivy Fei Tso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D2-FC4-0B5","20200627","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; depression; psychiatry; stress; covid-19; loneliness; social isolation; mental health; anxiety; psychosis; psychosis risk","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Karantzas et al (2020) COVID-19 Relationship Wellbeing & Loneliness","It has been assumed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted parental and family relationships due to issues including economic problems, strains of home confinement and social isolation. Despite these assumptions, there has been little research to date investigating the impact of COVID-19 stressors on parents’ relationship wellbeing and loneliness. Hence, there is an insufficient evidence base with which to guide policy or action in this most critical arena. The current study reports data from a large national representative sample (N=1,829) of Australian parents, surveyed during the early phases of the COVID-19 lockdown. Drawing on widely studied relationship models of vulnerability-stress and stress-buffering, Structural Equation Models (SEM) were derived to test the extent that COVID-19 stressors, personal vulnerabilities (mental health problems, attachment insecurity), relationship adaptation processes (constructive communication, partner support), and the interactions between these variables, predicted relationship quality and loneliness. After controlling for pre-pandemic stressors, relationship adaptations buffered the negative effects of COVID-19 stressors and personal vulnerabilities on relationship quality and loneliness. The findings provide support for a model of stress-buffering over a model of vulnerability-stress. The findings have important implications for the identification of parents at risk of relationship difficulties and social disconnection during the pandemic, and for policy and practice in how best to strengthen relationships and human connection during COVID-19.","Gery Karantzas et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460FA-FCC-E19","20201007","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; parents; stress-buffering; vulnerability-stress; romantic relationships; loneliness; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Report1: Impact of Covid-19 on young people aged 13-24 in the UK- preliminary findings","COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented disruption of normal social relationships and activities, which are so important during the teen years and young adulthood, and to education and economic activity worldwide. The impact of this on young people’s mental health and future prospects may affect their need for support and services, and the speed of the nation’s social recovery afterwards. This study focused on the unique challenges facing young people at different points during adolescent development, which spans from the onset of puberty until the mid-twenties. Although this is an immensely challenging time and there is a potential risk for long term trauma, adolescence can be a period of opportunity, where the teenagers’ brain enjoys greater capacity for change. Hence, the focus on young people is key for designing age-specific interventions and public policies, which can offer new strategies for instilling resilience, emotional regulation, and self-control. In fact, adolescents might be assisted to not only cope, but excel, in spite of the challenges imposed by this pandemic. Our work will feed into the larger societal response that utilizes the discoveries about adolescence in the way we raise, teach, and treat young people during this time of crisis. Wave 1 data has already been collected from 2,002 young people aged 13-24, measuring their mental health (anxiety, depression, trauma), family functioning, social networks, and resilience, and social risk-taking at the time of the pandemic.

Thus, in this study, we investigated the associations among the socioeconomic changes driven by the pandemic, mental health, life satisfaction (past, present, and future), and fear of COVID-19 in Japan. In total, 560 Japanese individuals took an online survey that included questions on their self-restraint and changing incomes and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale; Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale; and present, past, and future life satisfaction scale. Two structural equation models were constructed, revealing that fear of COVID-19 brought about reduced times outdoors, reduced incomes, negative symptoms, and negative present, future, and past life satisfaction.","Daichi Sugawara et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C0-5FD-0C2","20200630","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; covid-19; psychological well-being; fear of covid-19; life satisfaction","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Factors Mediating the Psychological Well-Being of Healthcare Workers Responding to Global Pandemics: A Systematic Review","The worldwide outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and the likelihood of future pandemics has raised the attention to the effects of pandemics on the psychological well-being of individuals. Given their indispensable role in such situations, healthcare workers are at greater risk of mental health issues. This paper aimed to review the mediators of psychological well-being among healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. After registration on PROSPERO, a systematic review was performed in four databases. Following study selection (PRISMA guidelines), inclusion criteria and analysis methods were assessed. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the EPHPP criteria. Out of 1467 references, 39 studies were included in this review. In most studies, worse well-being outcomes, such as stress, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout were related to demographic characteristics, direct contact with infected patients, and poor perceived support. In turn, self-efficacy, coping ability, altruism, and support from employers and organisations were found to be protective factors. Despite some limitations in the quality of the available evidence, this review highlights the prevalence of poor mental health outcomes in healthcare workers responding to global pandemics. Future interventions should target the identified mediators to promote psychological well-being among this population, particularly social and organisational support, which may improve workers’ mental health and reduce burnout and turnover.","Jekaterina Schneider et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46164-DBE-BD0","20200730","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; healthcare professionals; mediation; pandemic; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Heart Rate Variability Moderates the Link Between COVID-19 Stress and Emotional Problems in Adolescents: Evidence for Differential Susceptibility","The COVID-19 pandemic is a unique period of stress and uncertainty that will have significant implications for adolescent mental health. Nevertheless, stress about COVID-19 may be more consequential for some adolescents’ mental health than for others. We examined whether heart rate variability (HRV) indicated differential susceptibility to mental health difficulties associated with COVID-19 stress. Approximately four years prior to the pandemic, we assessed resting HRV and HRV reactivity to a well-validated stress paradigm in 87 adolescents. During the pandemic, these adolescents (ages 13-19) reported on their health-related stress and concerns about COVID-19 and their recent emotional problems. The association between COVID-19 stress and emotional problems was significantly stronger for adolescents who previously exhibited higher resting HRV or higher HRV reactivity. For adolescents who exhibited lower resting HRV or lower HRV reactivity, COVID-19 stress was not associated with emotional problems. Thus, parasympathetic functioning may reflect differential susceptibility to the effects of COVID-19 stress on mental health during the pandemic.","Jonas G.

"FreeSurfer based segmentation of hippocampal subfields: a review of methods and applications, with a novel quality control procedure for ENIGMA studies and other collaborative efforts","Structural hippocampal abnormalities are common in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, and even variation within the normal range is related to cognitive performance and other complex phenotypes such as stress sensitivity. Hippocampal subregions are increasingly studied, as automated algorithms have become available for mapping and volume quantification. In the context of the ENIGMA Consortium, several Disease Working Groups are using the FreeSurfer software to analyze hippocampal subregion (subfield) volumes in patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other conditions, along with data from matched controls. In this overview, we explain the algorithm’s principle, summarize measurement reliability studies, and demonstrate two additional aspects (subfield autocorrelation and volume/reliability correlation) with illustrative data. We then explain the rationale for a standardized hippocampal subfield segmentation quality control (QC) procedure for improved pipeline harmonization. To guide researchers to make optimal use of the algorithm, we discuss how global size and age effects can be modelled, how QC steps can be incorporated and how subfields may be aggregated into composite volumes. This discussion is based on a synopsis of 162 published neuroimaging studies (01/2013–12/2019) that applied the FreeSurfer hippocampal subfield segmentation in a broad range of domains including cognition and healthy aging, brain development and neurodegeneration, affective disorders, schizophrenia, childhood trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder, inflammatory and systemic disease, alcoholism, stress regulation, neurotoxicity, as well as assessments of heritability, effects of candidate genes, genome-wide association studies and epigenetic effects. Lastly, we highlight points where FreeSurfer-based hippocampal subfield studies may be optimized.","Philipp Gero Sämann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4600B-CFB-F5C","20200811","PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Clinical Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Computational Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; hippocampus; enigma; hippocampal subregions; quality control; freesurfer; hippocampal subfields; mri; segmentation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Parenting and child and adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: Early work indicates the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. Understanding which children may be more at risk for mental health problems, and which risk factors are amenable to change is crucial. The importance of studying children’s mental health within the context of the family system is recognized. Methods: The current study investigated associations between parent factors, and children’s mental health during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic across a number of Western countries (primarily Australia and the United Kingdom). Parents (N = 385) reported on their pandemic-related stress, mental health, and parenting behaviors, in addition to mental health changes in their 5-17 year old children (N = 481) during April/May 2020. Results: Analyses revealed significant associations between parent COVID-19 pandemic stress, parent depression, anxiety and stress symptoms, and increases in child internalizing and externalizing problems. Harsh parenting behavior was associated with trauma symptoms and increases in externalizing problems. Further, some associations were more pronounced for children with existing mental health problems, and for disadvantaged and single parent families. Limitations: The data was cross-sectional, the majority of participant parents were female, and all data were parent-report. Conclusions: Findings suggest the importance of parents in influencing children’s mental health during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is needed to investigate longer-term impacts.","Sarah Whittle et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C1-803-230","20200805","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; parenting; child development; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Exposure to COVID-19 Pandemic Stress: Associations with Depression and Anxiety in Emerging Adults in the US","Background: Stressful events due to the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to have profound effects on mental health, and validated methods for assessing these experiences and associations with psychopathology are needed. We developed the Pandemic Stress Questionnaire (PSQ) and tested its psychometric properties, characterized experiences in emerging adults, and examined associations with internalizing symptoms. Methods: Emerging adults (N=450) completed the PSQ and measures of internalizing symptoms and perceived stress through an online platform in May 2020. One month later, 288 participants completed a follow-up questionnaire to assess reliability of the PSQ and longitudinal associations between stress and internalizing symptoms. Results: Results supported the validity/reliability of the PSQ and indicated that stressful events were highly prevalent in May, particularly among younger, female, and Black emerging adults. Symptoms of depression and anxiety were high overall, but decreased at the follow-up assessment. Pandemic-related stress was moderately associated with both depression and anxiety at each assessment, but baseline stress did not predict change in symptoms when controlling for baseline symptoms. Conclusions: Results provide empirical evidence that emerging adults are at high risk for depression and anxiety related to the psychosocial effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and highlight specific types of experiences associated with greatest risk. Further, this study provides support for a questionnaire measure of experiences related to the COVID-19 pandemic that can be applied in future work to advance understanding of risk and resilience in response to stressful events.","Autumn Kujawa et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614D-D78-F8E","20200629","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; depression; pandemics; young adult; coronavirus","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Loneliness in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional results from The COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study","Objectives: Loneliness is a significant public health issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in lockdown measures limiting social contact. The UK public are worried about the impact of these measures on mental health outcomes. Understanding the prevalence and predictors of loneliness at this time is a priority issue for research. Design: The study employed a cross-sectional online survey design. Method: Baseline data collected between March 23rd and April 24th 2020 from UK adults in the COVID-19 Psychological Wellbeing Study were analysed (N = 1963, 18-87 years, M = 37.11, SD = 12.86, 70% female). Logistic regression analysis was used to look at the influence of sociodemographic, social, health and COVID-19 specific factors on loneliness. Results: The prevalence of loneliness was 27% (530/1963). Risk factors for loneliness were younger age group (OR: 4.67 – 5.31), being separated or divorced (OR: 2.29), meeting clinical criteria for major depression (OR: 1.74), greater emotion regulation difficulties (OR: 1.04), and poor quality sleep due to the COVID-19 crisis (OR: 1.30). Higher levels of social support (OR: 0.92), being married/co-habiting (OR: 0.35) and living with a great number of adults (OR: 0.87) were protective factors. Conclusions: Rates of loneliness during the initial phase of lockdown were high. Risk factors were not specific to the COVID-19 crisis. Findings suggest that supportive interventions to reduce loneliness should prioritise younger people and those with mental health symptoms. Improving emotion regulation and sleep quality may be optimal initial targets to reduce the impact of COVID-19 regulations on mental health outcomes.","Jenny Groarke et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46147-2B6-22E","20200624","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; mental health; risk factors; cross-sectional studies; protective factors; loneliness; emotion regulation; public health; prevalence; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Depression, Environmental Reward, Coping Motives and Alcohol Consumption During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Increases in the incidence of psychological distress and alcohol use during the COVID-19 pandemic have been predicted. Environmental reward and self-medication theories suggest that increased distress and greater social/environmental constraints during COVID-19 could result in increases in depression and drinking to cope with negative affect. The current study had two goals: (1) to clarify the presence and direction of changes in alcohol use and related outcomes after the introduction of COVID-19 social distancing requirements, and; (2) to test hypothesized mediation models to explain individual differences in alcohol use during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (n = 1127) were U.S. residents recruited for participation in an online survey. The survey included questions assessing environmental reward, depression, COVID-19-related distress, drinking motives, and alcohol use outcomes (alcohol use; drinking motives; alcohol demand, and solitary drinking). Outcomes were assessed for two timeframes: the 30 days prior to state-mandated social distancing (‘pre-social-distancing’), and the 30 days after the start of state-mandated social distancing (‘post-social-distancing’). Depression severity, coping motives, and frequency of solitary drinking were significantly greater post-social-distancing relative to pre-social-distancing. Conversely, environmental reward and other drinking motives (social, enhancement, and conformity) were significantly lower post-social distancing compared to pre-social-distancing. Time spent drinking and frequency of binge drinking were greater post-social-distancing compared to pre-social-distancing, whereas typical alcohol quantity/frequency were not significantly different between timeframes. Indices of alcohol demand were variable with regard to change. Mediation analyses suggested a significant indirect effects of reduced environmental reward with drinking quantity/frequency via increased depressive symptoms and coping motives, and a significant indirect effect of COVID-related distress with alcohol quantity/frequency via coping motives for drinking. Results provide early evidence regarding the relation of psychological distress with alcohol consumption and coping motives during the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, results largely converged with predictions from self-medication and environmental reinforcement theories. Future research will be needed to study prospective associations among these outcomes.","Matthew Mcphee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46035-C14-752","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; sars-cov-2; social distancing; covid-19; depression; alcohol; mental health; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Economic Evaluations of Mental Health Programs for Children and Adolescents in the United States: A Systematic Review","The United States spent 201 billion dollars on mental health related concerns in 2013, ranking mental illness as the leading cause of disability and the single largest source of economic burden worldwide. With mental health-related treatment costs and economic burden only projected to rise, there is an increasing need for cost-inclusive evaluations of mental health interventions specific to the United States as economic evaluations across countries are not easily comparable. Thus, this systematic, descriptive review characterized the types of interventions, target populations, and the quality of 9 economic evaluation studies (e.g., cost-effectiveness, cost-benefit) of youth mental health services conducted in the United States from 2003 to 2019. Existing evaluations suggest that certain mental health interventions for youth, among the few that have been formally evaluated, may be cost-effective and cost-beneficial. However, the small number and mixed quality of eligible studies highlights a dearth of rigorously conductedeconomic evaluations on this topic, variability in cost and outcome assessment approaches, as well as the homogenous characteristics of interventions evaluated. Greater standardization is needed to increase confidence in these conclusions and generate a body of meaningful, quality research that has the potential to shape evidence-based mental health policy.","Jenna Sung et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B2-12B-801","20200618","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Clinical Child Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Early Life Stress Predicts Depressive Symptoms in Adolescents During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Mediating Role of Perceived Stress","Background: Exposure to early life stress (ELS) is alarmingly prevalent, and has been linked to the high rates of depression documented in adolescence. Researchers have theorized that ELS may increase adolescents’ vulnerability or reactivity to the effects of subsequent stressors, placing them at higher risk for developing symptoms of depression. Methods: We tested this formulation in a longitudinal study by assessing levels of stress and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in a sample of adolescents from the San Francisco Bay Area (N=100; 43 male; ages 13-20 years) who had been characterized 4-7 years earlier (M=5.27, SD=0.75 years) with respect to exposure to ELS and symptoms of depression. Results: As expected, severity of ELS predicted levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic (r(98)=0.25, p=.012), which were higher in females than in males (t(98)=-3.36, p=.001). Importantly, the association between ELS and depression was mediated by adolescents’ reported levels of stress, even after controlling for demographic and other COVID-19-related variables. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of monitoring the mental health of vulnerable children and adolescents during this pandemic and targeting perceived stress and isolation in high-risk youth.","Ian Gotlib et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4608F-A98-64F","20200619","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; covid-19; perceived stress; depression; early life stress; adolescence","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mechanisms of COVID-19 Mental Health Burden","New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown in March and April 2020 was among the world's most stringent. Similar to other countries, New Zealand's lockdown occurred amidst pervasive health and economic uncertainties. However, New Zealanders experienced comparatively less psychological distress. To test theories of pandemic distress mitigation, we use national longitudinal responses with pre-COVID-19 baselines and systematically quantify psychological distress trajectories within the same individuals during the lockdown (pre-COVID-19 = 2018/2019; stringent-lockdown = March/April 2020; N = 940). Most distress indicators were minimally elevated. However, there was a three-fold increase in feelings of worthlessness. Neither satisfaction with the government, nor business-satisfaction, nor a sense of neighbourhood community were effective distress defences. Perceived social-belonging and health-satisfaction mitigated feelings of worthlessness. A silver lining was a relief from feelings of effort, which social-belonging fostered. That social-belonging and health satisfaction could quell serious distress among those low in government confidence, low in business satisfaction, and low neighbourhood community proves that distress mitigation is possible without shifting a population's general political, economic, and civic attitudes. Protection of income and containment of infectious disease threat reduces mental health burdens. Though feelings of worthlessness surge during lockdown, such feelings attenuate from interpersonal belonging with people one already knows.","Joseph Bulbulia et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46163-B20-33A","20200623","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods|Statistical Methods; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; employment; brms; kessler-6; glmm; bayesian; ordinal; stan; anxiety; longitudinal; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Decision making and mental health across adulthood during social distancing","Covid-19-related social-distancing measures have dramatically limited physical social contact between individuals of all ages. We wondered how these new societal conditions would impact the choices of individuals of different ages and if social distancing measures would have a differential emotional impact on older individuals. Early media reports suggested that older adults were more likely to ignore social distancing guidelines. We conducted two online studies to examine temporal discounting of monetary, health, and social rewards, COVID-19 beliefs, social distancing behaviors, and mental health symptoms. We used the initial study (N = 233) to form our hypotheses about social distancing behaviors and we ran the second, pre-registered study (N = 243) to determine if these relationships replicated. We found that although older adults were more likely to prefer smaller, sooner (i.e., temporal discount) social and health-related rewards in decision-making tasks, there were no adult age differences in social distancing behavior. The increased motivation for immediate social contact in older age appears to be balanced by a similarly increased motivation for physical health. Although older adults reported being more likely to contract Covid-19 and experience more severe health consequences, they experienced fewer overall Covid-19-related mental health symptoms compared to younger adults. These data contradict media anecdotes and suggest that older adults are not only similarly compliant with distancing guidelines, but also are faring relatively better emotionally during the pandemic while overall mental health issues are higher than normal in the population.","Kendra Leigh Seaman et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46008-064-E80","20200717","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; social distancing; covid-19; temporal discounting; mental health; aging","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Therapeutic alliance, social inclusion and infection control - Towards pandemic-adapted mental health care services in Switzerland","The Covid-19 pandemic has challenged the Swiss mental health care system. Many services were downsized or closed and admission to treatment and care institutions was restricted during lockdown. While these measures were necessary according to the general containment and mitigation strategies of federal and cantonal authorities, this situation has had negative consequences for care and treatment of service users. This paper asks to re-think key aspects of the Swiss mental health care system that have demonstrated to be not adaptable to the pandemic. In particular, the paper suggests diversifying care and treatment settings and strengthening outpatient and outreach services. Finally, some proposals to foster social inclusion during and after the pandemic are outlined.","Dirk Richter et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46021-DE5-951","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; mental health services; pandemic; switzerland; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on College Student Mental Health: A Longitudinal Examination of Risk and Protective Factors","The spread of the novel coronavirus has led to unprecedented changes in daily living. College students may face unique challenges associated with these changes. In the present study, college students (N = 205) completed a battery of questionnaires in April of 2020, after having completed similar measures 8, 5, and 2 months prior as part of a larger study. A repeated measures ANOVA suggested significantly greater depression and anxiety symptom severity during the pandemic than at any other time during the 2019-2020 academic year. Static and modifiable factors associated with psychological distress and controlling for pre-existing psychological distress were examined. Cognitive and behavioral avoidance was the most consistent predictor of psychological distress during the pandemic. Online social engagement and problematic Internet use also conferred greater risk. Women and Latinx participants were more likely to experience elevated distress during the pandemic, even when controlling for distress prior to the pandemic.","Martha Zimmermann et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460C8-053-EA4","20200617","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; college students; covid-19; depression; avoidance; distress; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Neurotic coronavirus generation? The report from the second wave of research on the students from Kraków","The report presents the results of the second wave of research conducted among the students of the Pedagogical University of Kraków. The research method was an on-line survey (CAWI) on the sample of 1927 respondents. The comparison of responses from both surveys indicates that the change in attitudes and mental condition of the respondents occurred. After almost three months of quarantine the youth is less interested in the pandemic, has lower fear of the coronavirus, evaluates the actions taken by government to combat the pandemic worse. A decrease in satisfaction with their lives and an increase in the symptoms of stress is also observed. Negative emotions of anxiety, sadness, exhaustion and loneliness are also dominant among youth. The psychological resources were exploited to a relatively small extent. The adaptive reactions remain on a similar level. Among the respondents active combating of the threats and redirecting their attention as well as comforting oneself that it could have been worse are dominant. The respondents reveal the symptoms of burnout with remote education. Mental tiredness, decreased efficiency of actions and a decrease in motivation for learning are observed as well.","Piotr Dlugosz","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46066-E0E-2A3","20200617","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; fear; youth; covid-19; poland; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Resilience During Uncertainty Greater Social Connectedness During COVID-19 Lockdown is Associated with Reduced Distress and Fatigue","Background: Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented social distancing measures resulting in significant changes to people’s usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people’s wellbeing, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity. Aims: We examined the relationship between individuals’ levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data was collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry—both general and COVID-19 specific—and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks. Results: Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19 specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19 specific worries—respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity.","Jonas P.

"Mental health outcomes of adults with comorbidity and chronic diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic: a matched case-control study","Background: Individuals with certain pre-existing chronic health conditions have been identified as a high-risk group for fatalities of COVID-19. Therefore, it is likely that individuals with chronic diseases may worry during this pandemic to the detriment of their mental health. This study compares the mental health of Bangladeshi adults affected by chronic disease to a healthy, matched control group during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A matched case–control analysis was performed with data collected from 395 respondents with chronic diseases and 395 controls matched for age, gender and residence. Inclusion criteria for cases were respondents who self-reported having asthma, cardiovascular symptoms and/or diabetes. Respondents were recruited using an online survey, which included the DASS-21 measure to assess stress, anxiety, and depression. Chi-square tests, Fisher’s exact tests and a conditional logistic regression were performed to examine associations among variables. Results: The prevalence estimates of stress, anxiety and depression were significantly higher among cases (73.7%; 59%; 71.6%, respectively) than among controls (43.3%; 25.6%; 31.1%). Chi-square tests showed significant associations between having chronic diseases and mental health outcomes. A conditional logistic regression showed that respondents with asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular symptoms, or any combination of these diseases had higher odds of feeling stress, anxiety, and depression than healthy individuals. Conclusion: These results underscore a subpopulation vulnerable to mental health consequences during this pandemic and indicate the need for additional mental health resources to be available to those with chronic diseases.","Abu Sayeed et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4624E-9CC-022","20200617","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; bangladesh; comorbidity; mental health; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Promoting Graduate Student Mental Health during COVID-19: Acceptability and Perceived Utility of an Online Single-Session Intervention","The COVID-19 outbreak has simultaneously increased the need for mental health services and decreased their availability. Brief online self-help interventions that can be completed in a single session could be especially helpful in improving access to care during the crisis. However, little is known about the uptake, acceptability, and perceived utility of these interventions outside of clinical trials in which participants are compensated. Here, we describe the development, deployment, acceptability ratings, and pre-post effects of a single-session intervention, the Common Elements Toolbox (COMET), adapted for the COVID-19 crisis to support graduate and professional students. Participants (n = 263), who were not compensated, were randomly assigned to two of three modules: behavioral activation, cognitive restructuring, and gratitude. Over one week, 263 individuals began and 189 individuals (72%) completed the intervention. Participants reported that the intervention modules were acceptable (93% endorsing), helpful (88%), engaging (86%), applicable to their lives (87%), and could help them manage COVID-related challenges (88%). Participants reported pre- to post-program improvements in secondary control (i.e., the belief that one can control their reactions to objective events; dav=0.36, dz=0.50, p<0.001) and in the perceived negative impact of the COVID-19 crisis on their quality of life (dav=0.22, dz=0.25, p<0.001). On average, differences in their perceived ability to handle lifestyle changes resulting from the pandemic were positive, but small and at the level of a nonsignificant trend (dav=0.13, dz=0.14, p=0.066).

"Drinking to cope during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of external and internal stress-related factors in coping motive pathways to alcohol use, solitary drinking, and alcohol problems","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in massive disruptions to society, to the economy, and to daily life. Some people may turn to alcohol to cope with stress during the pandemic, which may put them at risk for heavy drinking and alcohol-related harms. Research is needed to identify the factors that are relevant for coping-motivated drinking during these extraordinary circumstances to inform interventions. This study provides an empirical examination of coping motive pathways to alcohol problems during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N = 320; 54.6% male; mean age 32 years old) were Canadian adult drinkers who completed an online survey assessing work- and home-related factors, psychological factors, and alcohol-related outcomes over the past 30 days, covering a time period soon after the initiation of the COVID-19 emergency response. The results of a theory-informed path model showed that living with children under 18, greater depression, and lower social connectedness each predicted unique variance in past 30-day coping motives, which in turn predicted increased past 30-day alcohol use (controlling for pre-COVID-19 alcohol use reported retrospectively). Income loss was associated with increased alcohol use and living alone was associated with increased solitary drinking (controlling for pre-COVID-19 levels), but these associations were not mediated by coping motives. Increased alcohol use, increased solitary drinking, and coping motives for drinking were all independently associated with past 30-day alcohol problems, and indirect paths to alcohol problems from living with children, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone were all supported. Findings provide insight into coping-motivated drinking early in the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for longitudinal research to establish longer-term outcomes of drinking to cope.","Jeffrey Wardell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46220-A31-593","20200615","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Substance Abuse and Addiction; stress; income; alcohol problems; social isolation; drinking alone; depression; coping; solitary drinking; alcohol; covid-19; social distancing; coronavirus; drinking motives; parent","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

This paper describes the the first two waves of the UK survey (the ‘parent’ strand of the Consortium) during March-April 2020. A longitudinal, internet panel survey assessed: (1) COVID-19 related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours; (2) the occurrence of common mental health disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression); as well as the role of (3) psychological factors (e.g. personality, locus of control, resilience) and (4) social and political attitudes (e.g. authoritarianism, social dominance), in influencing the public’s response to the pandemic. Quota sampling was used to recruit a nationally representative (in terms of age, sex, and household income) sample of adults (N=2025), 1406 of whom were followed-up one month later (69.4% retention rate). The baseline sample was representative of the UK population in terms of economic activity, ethnicity, and household composition. Attrition was predicted by key socio-demographic characteristics, and an inverse probability weighting procedure was employed to ensure the follow-up sample was representative of the baseline sample.

"Mood Symptoms Predict COVID-19 Pandemic Distress but not Vice Versa: An 18-Month Longitudinal Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had medical, economic and behavioral implications on a global scale and was argued to have negatively impacted the population’s mental health as well. The current study utilizes longitudinal data to assess such an assertion. An international group of 218 participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, rumination and distress intoler-ance at two baselines six months apart as well as at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic ex-actly 12 months later. Contrary to expectations, depression, rumination, and distress intolerance were at equivalent levels during the pandemic as they were at baseline. Anxiety was reduced by a trivial degree (d = .10). Furthermore, a comparison of quantitative explanatory models indi-cated that symptom severity and pandemic-related environmental stressors predicted pandem-ic-related distress, but pandemic-related distress did not predict symptom severity. These find-ings underscore the necessity of longitudinal designs and diathesis-stress models in the study of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Benjamin A Katz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DE-A9E-78B","20200611","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; depression; covid-19; psychological stress; equivalence testing","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Well-Being and COVID-19 Anxiety: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study in China","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic threatens human beings’ livelihoods and mental health, which lowers their well-being and gives rise to anxiety. This study examines whether there is a causal relationship between people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety. Method: 222 participants (54.50% female, Mage = 31.53, SD = 8.17) from 26 provinces of China completed measures of well-being and COVID-19 anxiety at three key nodes of the development of COVID-19 in China. Results: The results showed that people’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the peak, decline and trough stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, the cross-lagged analysis showed that the participants’ well-being at Time 1 significantly predicted their COVID-19 anxiety at Time 2. However, well-being at Time 2 was not associated with the COVID-19 anxiety at Time 3. Furthermore, COVID-19 anxiety could not predict subsequent well-being. Conclusions: People’s well-being and COVID-19 anxiety fluctuated with the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and people’s well-being at the peak stage of the COVID-19 pandemic predicted their subsequent anxiety. The current findings contribute to clarifying the causal relationship between well-being and anxiety, as well as finding ways to alleviate people’s COVID-19 anxiety.","Zhuojun Wang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4612E-F41-854","20200615","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; cross-lagged analysis; china; covid-19 anxiety; well-being; longitudinal design","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Barriers and facilitators to mood and confidence in pregnancy and early parenthood during COVID-19 in the UK: A mixed-methods synthesis survey","Background: Parents’ well-being during pregnancy and early parenthood is critical for children’s development. Environmental stressors can significantly challenge parents’ well-being. Aims: To investigate how COVID-19 and associated restrictions influence mood and parenting confidence of expectant parents and those in early parenthood, identifying barriers and facilitators. Methods: We used a cross-sectional online survey to collect data from 590 expectant parents and parents of infants (564 females) during the most restrictive phase of the lockdown in the UK. Survey included a mixture of forced-choice and open-ended questions pertaining to mood, perceived social support, media use, online interactions, and parenting expectations. Quantitative data were analysed using multiple linear regression and proportional odds models, while an inductive thematic analysis was employed for qualitative data. Quantitative and qualitative data were qualitatively synthesised. Results: A decrease in mood and parenting confidence were found. Barriers included practical difficulties (finding essentials, reliable health information), social difficulties (loss of physical contact, decreased support), and uncertainty during pregnancy. Facilitators included support from others and for first-time parents, loss of childcare resulting in greater parenting confidence. While online resources and communication were not preferable to face-to-face interactions, technology was a helpful tool for communicating, getting support, and finding essentials and information during lockdown. Conclusion: By mid-May 2020, mood and parenting confidence among expectant and parents of newborns in the UK were significantly reduced. Consideration of barriers and facilitators in healthcare and psychological support provided is likely to play an important part in promoting parental mental health and healthy parent-child relationships.","Alejandra Perez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46121-20E-4D8","20201011","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Couples, Marriage, and Family; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Emotional Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Infancy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Prenatal Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; covid-19; parental well-being; pandemic; pregnancy; infancy; parenting","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The psychological wellbeing of frontline workers in the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic: First and second wave findings from the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study","Background: Extant research relating to the psychological impact of infectious respiratory disease epidemics/pandemics suggests that frontline workers are particularly vulnerable. Methods: The current study used data from the first two waves of the United Kingdom (UK) survey of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study to compare frontline workers with the rest of the UK population on prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during the first week of ‘lockdown’ (Wave 1) and one month later (Wave 2). Results: Compared to the rest of the population, frontline workers generally, and individual frontline worker groups, had significantly higher prevalence estimates of depression, anxiety, and PTSD during both wave 1 and wave 2. While prevalence estimates of depression significantly increased among Local & National Government Workers from Wave 1 (15.4%) to Wave 2 (38.5%), no significant improvement or deterioration in mental health status was recorded for any other frontline worker group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis showed that, beyond other risk factors, food workers were nearly twice as likely as others to screen positive for anxiety, while all frontline worker groups, other than transport workers, were significantly more likely to screen positive for PTSD (Odds Ratios ranged from 1.74 – 3.43). Finally, while frontline workers, generally, were significantly more likely than the general public to have received mental health advice during the pandemic (26.9% versus 20.3% respectively), this was largely reflective of health and social care workers (37.9%).

Its exponential capacity has overwhelmed even the most resilient health systems (1). The already significant impact of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) on the global scale is worsened by psychological responses that may aggravate the health crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study is aimed at collecting demographic information, prevalence of psychological morbidities and associated coping styles during the COVID-19 pandemic on Peruvian population. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through online survey using snowball sampling techniques after the state of emergency was declared in Perú. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ -28) identify somatic symptom, anxiety/ insomnia, social misfunctioning and depression prevalence and the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (COPE-28) maps strategies addressing recent stress. RESULTS: We collected data from 434 self-selected participants within 18-68 years old (ME =33.87), by analysing the socio-economic information in which the majority of the respondents were women (61.3%), aged between 18 and 28 (41.7%), from well-educated groups (>=85.0 %), Peruvian (94.2%), working citizen (57.4%) and single (71.20 %). Nearly 40.8% rated psychological problems, expressing fear of being infected by coronavirus (71.43%). Regression analysis shows that female gender is associated to higher somatic (p<0.001*, C.I: -2.75 to -.99) and anxiety/insomnia symptoms (p=0.00*, C.I: -2.98 to 0.84). Depression and social dysfunction are experienced at any age. Educational status is protective against developing psychological disorders (p<0.05). While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge).

While active responses (Acceptance and Social support) are scarcely used by individuals with psychological problems; Passive strategies are commonly reported (Denial, Self-Distraction, Self-Blame, Disconnection, and Emotional discharge). CONCLUSION: These findings provide a better understanding of psychological disorders resulting from the current pandemic in Peruvian population. This evidence informs the need to strengthen mental health programs, especially in less privileged groups after the Covid-19 pandemic.","Rita Judith Ames-Guerrero et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AF-D39-1F2","20200615","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; public health; mental health; coping strategies; primary prevention; psychological morbidities","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Longitudinal evaluation of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain","The aim of this study was to assess the temporal evolution of the psychological impact of the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown from two surveys carried out in Spain with a time difference of about one month. Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, and the psychological impact of the situation were longitudinally analyzed using the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES) respectively. The Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS) and the Mini-Social Phobia Inventory (Mini-SPIN) were also employed to evaluate resilience and social anxiety. There was a total of 4,724 responses from both surveys. Symptomatic scores of anxiety, depression and stress were exhibited by 37.22%, 46.42% and 49.66% of the second survey respondents, showing a significant increase compared to the first survey (32.45%, 44.11% and 37.01%, respectively). There was no significant longitudinal change of the IES scores, with 48.30% of the second survey participants showing moderate to severe impact of the confinement. Low resilience was shown by 40.5% of the respondents, and high social anxiety by 34.8%. Constant news consumption about COVID-19 was found to be positively associated with symptomatic scores in the different scales. On the other hand, daily physical activity was found to be negatively associated with DASS-21 scores. Results indicate that people with social anxiety might be especially vulnerable to the development of other mental disorders after the relaxation of the confinement measures.","Álvaro Planchuelo-Gómez et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4623A-16D-42D","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; stress; covid-19; longitudinal; anxiety; posttraumatic stress disorder; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Perceived Risk and Mental Health Problems Among Healthcare Professionals During COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring the Mediating Effects of Resilience and Coronavirus Fear","During coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, healthcare professionals were particularly at high-risk of developing symptoms of mental health problems due to being on the frontline in the battle against COVID-19. This study examined the mediating roles of resilience and coronavirus fear in the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among healthcare professionals including doctors and nurses who were actively treating patients confirmed with COVID-19. We recruited 204 healthcare professionals (50% females) with a mean age of 32.92 years (SD=7.01). Results showed that perceived risk and coronavirus fear positively predicted depression, anxiety, and stress while resilience negatively predicted those mental health problems. Coronavirus fear mediated the relationship between perceived risk and resilience, depression, anxiety, and stress. Additionally, resilience mitigated the effect of coronavirus fear on depression, anxiety, and stress. This study is among the first indicating the importance of resilience and fear as critical mechanism that explain the relationship between perceived risk and mental health problems among health professionals directly caring for COVID-19 patients.","Murat Yildirim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A3-666-E0B","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; covid-19 perceived risk; covid-19; resilience; mental health problems; healthcare professionals; covid-19 fear","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Early life adversity, dispositional mindfulness, and longitudinal stress experience during the COVID-19 pandemic","Experiencing severe or prolonged stressors in early life is associated with increased risk for mental and physical disorders in adulthood. Further, individuals who experienced early life stress (ELS) may use dysfunctional coping strategies like stress-related eating, in contrast to more beneficial stress buffering mechanisms e.g. based on mindfulness. Whether these mechanisms contribute to increased levels of perceived stress and symptoms of mental disorders in individuals with ELS in times of crisis is yet unclear. As part of a larger project, we assessed changes in perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms in a sample of N=102 participants (81% female; meanage=23.49, SDage= 7.11, range 18–62) from October/December 2019 (prior to the Covid-19 pandemic) to April/June 2020 (after the German government introduced Covid-19 related restrictions). Additionally, we assessed ELS and dispositional mindfulness. Perceived stress and depression significantly increased while anxiety levels decreased. No significant change was observed for somatization. ELS and dispositional mindfulness were not associated with change scores, but with perceived stress and psychopathological symptoms at both assessments. The increase in perceived stress during the pandemic in a majority of participants demonstrates the impact of the pandemic in the general population.","Annika Benz et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46149-FB9-288","20200806","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; longitudinal data; anxiety; mental health; covid-19; depression; early life stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Coronavirus Stress, Meaningful Living, Optimism, and Depressive Symptoms: A Study of Moderated Mediation Model","In the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to public mental health stress, anxiety, panic, and behavioral disorders. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether meaning in life mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms and whether the mediating effect of meaning in life on depressive symptoms was moderated by optimism. The sample of the study included 475 undergraduate students attending a public university in an urban city of Turkey. They were 69.2% female, ranged in age between 18 and 34 years (M = 20.63, SD = 1.99). Results showed that meaning in life and optimism–pessimism mediated the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. Optimism also mediated the relationship between meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, optimism moderated the mediating effect of meaning in life in the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms. These results indicated that the relationship between coronavirus stress and depressive symptoms can be better understood by meaning in life and optimism.

"COVID Feel Good – An Easy Self-Help Virtual Reality Protocol to Overcome the Psychological Burden of Coronavirus","Background: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. Aims: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflexion. 360° or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships and goals. Methods: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. Conclusion: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness.","Giuseppe Riva et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A9-9EA-8BE","20200610","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Treatment; psychological support; virtual reality; post-traumatic stress disorder; psychological distress; self-help; coronavirus; anxiety; positive technology; research protocol; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Pandemic buying: Testing a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying using data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Over-purchasing and hoarding of necessities is a common response to crises, especially in developed economies where there is normally an expectation of plentiful supply. This behaviour was observed internationally early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of actual scarcity, this behaviour can be described as ‘panic buying’ and can lead to temporary shortages. However, there have been few psychological studies of this phenomenon. We propose a psychological model of over-purchasing informed by animal foraging theory and make predictions about variables that predict over-purchasing by either exacerbating or mitigating the anticipation of future scarcity. These variables include additional scarcity cues (e.g. loss of income), distress (e.g. depression), psychological factors that draw attention to these cues (e.g. neuroticism) or to reassuring messages (eg. analytical reasoning) or which facilitate over-purchasing (e.g. income). We tested our model in parallel nationally representative internet surveys of the adult general population conducted in the United Kingdom (UK: N = 2025) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI: N = 1041) 52 and 31 days after the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the UK and RoI, respectively. About three quarters of participants reported no or very little over-purchasing. More over-purchasing in RoI may have reflected different government messaging or historical factors. When over-purchasing occurred, it was observed across a wide range of product categories and was accounted for by a single latent factor. It was positively predicted by household income, the presence of children at home, psychological distress (depression, death anxiety), threat sensitivity (right wing authoritarianism) and mistrust of others (paranoia). Analytic reasoning ability had an inhibitory effect. Predictor variables accounted for 36% and 34% of the variance in over-purchasing in the UK and RoI respectively. With some caveats, the data supported our model and point to strategies to mitigate over-purchasing in future crises.","Richard Bentall et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46216-035-A5C","20200819","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; over-purchasing; general population; psychological; panic buying; pandemic; coronavirus; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Loneliness and social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic: Risk factors and associations with psychopathology","Background: The mitigation strategies employed against the COVID-19 pandemic have severe mental health consequences. In particular, as a result of the social distancing protocols, loneliness is likely to increase. The aim of the present study was to investigate (a) the levels of loneliness in the Norwegian population during the strict social distancing non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) implemented against the pandemic, (b) the risk and resilience factors for loneliness and (c) the associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Methods: A survey was disseminated online to the adult Norwegian population when strict social distancing measures had been implemented for two weeks. The resulting sample of 10084 respondents was proportionally biased in terms of gender and educational level and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The levels of loneliness were compared to those found in other studies during non-pandemic circumstances, loneliness levels were compared across demographic sub-groups, and regression analyses were conducted to identify risk and resilience factors for loneliness and associations between loneliness and psychopathology symptoms. Results: Loneliness levels were higher than in comparable samples measured during non-pandemic circumstances. Among stable factors and as hypothesized, being single and having a psychiatric diagnosis were related to more loneliness with clinically significant effect sizes. Among state risk factors and as hypothesized, more rumination and worry in general was associated with stronger loneliness, showing a clinically significant effect size. Among the coping behaviors explored, doing new things at home not done otherwise was negatively related to loneliness, with a clinically significant effect size. Loneliness predicted both depression and anxiety with clinically significant effect sizes, when all potential confounders as well as psychiatric diagnosis were controlled. The relationship to depression was more marked. Conclusions: The findings support that loneliness is increased during implementation of social distancing measures to impede the coronavirus. Singles and those with a psychiatric diagnosis were most affected. The results support the link between loneliness and depression and anxiety. The results of the analysis of risk and resilience factors point to intervention targets for reducing loneliness during pandemic crises.","Asle Hoffart et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46199-EA9-277","20200610","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; quarantine; physical distancing; isolation; loneliness; epidemiology; risk factors; sars-cov-2; depression; psychopathology; social distancing; covid-19; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Longitudinal changes in mental health and the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had a range of negative social and economic effects that may contribute to a rise in mental health problems. In this observational population-based study, we examined longitudinal changes in the prevalence of mental health problems from before to during the COVID-19 crisis and identified subgroups that are psychologically vulnerable during the pandemic. Methods Participants (N =14,393; Observations =48,486) were adults drawn from wave 9 (2017-2019) of the nationally representative United Kingdom Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) and followed-up across three waves of assessment in April, May, and June, 2020. Mental health problems were assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Results The population prevalence of mental health problems (GHQ-12 score =3) increased by 13.5 percentage points from 24.3% in 2017-2019 to 37.8% in April, 2020 and remained elevated in May (34.7%) and June (31.9%), 2020. All sociodemographic groups examined showed statistically significant increases in mental health problems in April, 2020. The increase was largest among those aged 18-34 years (18.6 percentage points, 95% CI [14.3%-22.9%]), followed by females and high income and education groups. Levels of mental health problems subsequently declined between April and June, 2020 but remained significantly above pre-COVID-19 levels. Additional analyses showed that the rise in mental health problems observed throughout the COVID-19 pandemic was unlikely to be due to seasonality or year-to-year variation. Conclusions This study suggests that a pronounced and prolonged deterioration in mental health occurred as the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the UK between April and June, 2020.","Michael Daly et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4606A-538-ECB","20200610","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; psychological distress; mental health; representative study; coronavirus; covid-19; public health; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Basketball jones: Fan passion, motives, and reactions to the suspension of the National Basketball Association season due to COVID-19","The suspension of the 2019-2020 National Basketball Association (NBA) season due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant that NBA fans were unable to engage in an activity that they loved in the midst of a global health crisis. In this research, we assessed if fan responses to the suspension and the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with different types of fan passion and motives. Shortly after the NBA season suspension, NBA fans (N = 395) completed online surveys assessing harmonious and obsessive passion for being an NBA fan, motives for watching games, and various attitudes and responses to the suspension and COVID-19. We found that both fan passion and motives predicted responses to the suspension and COVID-19, particularly obsessive passion which predicted greater levels of distress, coping responses, and negative attitudes toward both the suspension and COVID-19. These findings have implications for both the passion and fan motives literatures.","Benjamin J. I.

"Home confinement during the COVID-19: day-to-day associations of sleep quality with rumination, psychotic-like experiences and somatic symptoms","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, populations from many countries have been confined at home for extended periods of time in stressful environmental and media conditions. Cross-sectional studies already evidenced deleterious psychological consequences, with poor sleep as a risk factor for impaired mental health. However, limitations of cross-sectional assessments are response bias tendencies, and the inability to track daily fluctuations in specific subjective experiences in extended confinement conditions. In a prospective study conducted across three European countries, we queried participants (N = 166) twice a day through an online interface about their sleep quality and their negative psychological experiences for two consecutive weeks. Focus was set on between-and within-person associations of subjective sleep quality with daytime experiences such as rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints about the typical symptoms of the coronavirus. Results show that daily reports of country-specific COVID-19 deaths predicted increased negative mood, psychotic-like experiences and somatic complaints during the same day, and decreased subjective sleep quality the following night. Disrupted sleep was globally associated with negative psychological outcomes during the study period, and a relatively poorer night of sleep predicted increased rumination, psychotic-like experiences, and somatic complaints the following day. This temporal association was unidirectional since daytime reports of negative mental experiences were not associated with poor sleep quality on the following night. Our findings show that night-to-night changes in sleep quality predict how individuals cope the next day with daily challenges induced by home confinement","Peter Simor et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46209-9FB-D9D","20200807","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; coronavirus; psychotic-like; somatic symptoms; sleep; rumination; stress","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"How communication technology helps mitigating the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on individual and social wellbeing: Preliminary support for a compensatory social interaction model","The present study preliminary tested the compensatory social interaction model for individuals experiencing the Covid-19 pandemic. This original model comprises two distinct processes: expression of online emotions leads to post-traumatic growth, which can favor positive mental health and prosocial behaviors; and receiving online social support leads to increases in positive mental health, which can also favor prosocial behaviors. Adults living in Italy (n=1412) completed an online survey during the lockdown period in March 2020. Results showed that being more involved in expression of online emotions was associated with higher post-traumatic growth that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Moreover, participants who perceived higher online social support were more likely to report higher positive mental health that in turn was associated with prosocial behaviors. Collectively, these two social interaction processes suggest that communication technologies appear to be critical resources in helping individuals cope with difficulties raised by the Covid-19 pandemic.","Natale Canale et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611E-AFF-C0E","20200730","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Interpersonal Relationships; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Prosocial Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Well-being; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Digital phenotyping of complex psychological responses to the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has negatively impacted mortality, economic conditions, and mental health. A large scale study on psychological reactions to the pandemic to inform ongoing population-level symptom tracking and response to treatment is currently lacking. Methods: Average intake scores for standard depression and anxiety symptom scales were tracked from January 1, 2017 to June 9, 2020 for patients seeking treatment from a digital mental health service to gauge the relationship between COVID-19 and self-reported symptoms. We applied natural language processing (NLP) to unstructured therapy transcript data from patients seeking treatment during the height of the pandemic in the United States between March 1, 2020 and June 9, 2020 to identify words associated with COVID-19 mentions. This analysis was used to identify symptoms that were present beyond those assessed by standard depression and anxiety measures. Results: Depression and anxiety symptoms reported by 169,889 patients between January 1, 2017 and June 9, 2020 were identified. There was no detectable change in intake depression symptom scores. Intake anxiety symptom scores increased 1.42 scale points [95% CI: 1.18, 1.65] between March 15, 2020 and April 1, 2020, when scores peaked. In the transcript data of these 169,889 patients, plus an expanded sample of 49,267 patients without symptom reports, term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) identified 2,377 positively correlated and 661 negatively correlated terms that were significantly (FDR<.01) associated with mentions of the virus. These terms were classifiable into 24 symptoms beyond those included in the diagnostic criteria for anxiety or depression. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic may have increased intake anxiety symptoms for individuals seeking digital mental health treatment. NLP analyses suggest that standard symptom scales for depression and anxiety alone are inadequate to fully assess and track psychological reactions to the pandemic. Symptoms of grief, trauma, obsession-compulsion, agoraphobia, hypochondriasis, panic, and non- suicidal self-injury should be monitored as part of a new COVID-19 Syndrome category.","Thomas Hull et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46158-7D5-3B8","20200813","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Helplessness Among University Students: An Empirical Study Based on a Modified Framework of Implicit Personality Theories","Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and within a very short period of time, teaching in the 2020 summer term changed from predominantly on-site to online instruction.

"Potential psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on children: A scoping review of pandemics & epidemics","Context: Physical distancing and health measures, such as school closures and work-at-home mandates, implemented to mitigate the transmission of COVID-19, will likely have far-reaching impacts on children’s psychosocial health and well-being. Objective: We aimed to examine extant literature on pandemics to identify the expected impact of COVID-19 on children’s psychosocial health and secondary outcomes, including nutritional, financial and child safety outcomes. Data Sources: Articles were searched within the Medline, Global Health, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases on June 11th, 2020. Gray literature was also examined from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations International Fund (UNICEF) until July 24th, 2020. Study Selection: A total of 8332 articles were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Of these, 7,919 and 413 articles were from academic databases and additional sources, respectively. Data Extraction: Results on child outcomes were extracted and collated. Results: Seventy-three articles met inclusion criteria. Children have faced significant challenges with 12% of total articles indicating loneliness/depression, 21% anxiety, 7% grief, 10% stress-related disorders, 25% child abuse, 8% family conflict, and 12% stigma during pandemics/epidemics. Furthermore, 25% of articles indicated economic challenges, 23% negative academic impacts, 33% improper nutrition, and 21% reduced opportunities for play/increased screen time.

"Emotion Regulation and Psychological and Physical Health during a Nationwide COVID-19 Lockdown","The COVID-19 pandemic poses considerable challenges that threaten health and well-being. Initial data supports that many people experienced elevated psychological distress as the pandemic emerged. Yet, prior examinations of average changes in well-being fail to identify who is at greater risk for poor psychological health. The aim of the current research was to examine whether the use of different emotion regulation strategies (emotional suppression, rumination, cognitive reappraisal) predicted residual changes in psychological and physical health during a nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. We leveraged an ongoing study in which participants had reported on their psychological and physical health prior to the pandemic. Participants then reported on the same health outcomes as well as their use of emotion regulation strategies, stress and emotion control difficulties during a nationwide lockdown involving confinement in the home for 5 weeks. Accounting for pre-pandemic psychological health, greater emotional suppression and rumination predicted greater depressive symptoms, lower emotional well-being, greater limitations due to emotional problems, and poorer social functioning during the lockdown, even when controlling for the detrimental effects of stress and emotion control difficulties. Accounting for pre-pandemic physical health, greater rumination predicted greater fatigue and poorer physical health, but the amount of stress people experienced was a stronger predictor across physical health outcomes. The results validate concerns that the stress of the pandemic risks declines in psychological and physical health and identify emotional suppression and rumination as important risk factors of poor psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rachel S.

"Cross-Cultural comparisons of psychosocial distress in the USA, South Korea, France, and Hong Kong during the initial phase of COVID-19","The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has resulted in the worldwide disruption of everyday life but the impact and response to the pandemic have not been uniform. Many countries rapidly deployed physical-distancing mandates to curb the spread of the COVID-19; others did not. Whilst social distancing strategies are necessary to reduce the transmission of the virus, it is also important to examine unintended psychiatric consequences of social isolation. We examined psychological distress in four countries with distinct public health strategies (South Korea, Hong Kong, France and the United States) to identify common and region-specific factors that may contribute to mental illness. From March to July June 2020, an online survey of demographics, general health, mental health, loneliness and social networks was conducted. Overall, younger age, greater concern for COVID, and increased loneliness predicted worse psychological outcome, although the magnitudes of the effects were not uniform among the four countries. We also observed notable differences in psychological distress; Hong Kong, with the strictest lockdown mandate, suffered the most drastic worsening of mental health outcome. To explain differential exacerbations of psychological distress around the globe during the pandemic, contributions of social unrest, economic uncertainty, and disruption to regular routine should be considered.","Derek Dean et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4613D-EF3-CA3","20200916","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; depression; global mental health; social isolation; covid-19; loneliness; anxiety","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Short-term effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicidal ideation: A prospective cohort study","Background: Few studies have examined the effect of pandemics on suicide-related outcomes. Aims: We examined whether suicidal ideation levels among the general population changed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic by tracking individuals between January and April 2020. Method: We used a prospective observational longitudinal design (n = 6,683) to conduct online surveys of the general adult population in Japan before (baseline) and during the pandemic (follow-up). Results: Suicidal ideation levels were significantly lower during than before the pandemic; however, the effect size was small (r = .07). Participants who were younger, with unstable employment, without children, with low income, and receiving psychiatric care were more likely to have higher suicidal ideation levels during the pandemic. Limitations: The dropout rate may have affected the results. COVID-19 cases and deaths in Japan were relatively lower than in other developed countries. Conclusion: Although the short-term impact of COVID-19 on suicidal ideation is limited, relatively young and economically vulnerable individuals are more likely to show exacerbated suicidal ideation during the pandemic.","Hajime Sueki et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A8-A1E-A07","20200919","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; novel coronavirus; mental health; suicide prevention; suicidal behaviors; public health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19, social isolation, and psychological distress in a Brazilian sample","Importance: The global infection outbreak by the new SARS-CoV-2 prompted community containment schedules; however, social isolation is a predictor of psychological distress. Objective: To determine whether social isolation, in Brazil, led to higher signs of psychological distress, and which intra- and inter-psychic variables mediated this effect. The following hypotheses were tested: 1) in isolated individuals, loneliness activates distancing and escape-avoidance coping strategies with intensities that are directly correlated with symptoms of anxiety and common health disorders; 2) in isolated individuals, poor reliance on social support coping strategies increase the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders; 3) in isolated individuals, External Entrapment moderates the effects of loneliness such that the higher the feelings of entrapment, the higher the effects of loneliness on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. 4) in both isolated and non-isolated individuals, intense reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies decrease (moderate) the effects of information consumption on symptoms of anxiety and common mental disorders. No a priori hypothesis on the specific nature of the subjective experiences of social isolation were established. We proposed that the semantic field of social isolation should present a complex and multidimensional nature. Design: Two phases of web-based surveys were applied to participants between May 25th 2020 and August 19th 2020. Setting: Brazilian participants responded surveys on the web. Participants: For Phase 1, 440 participants responded to the survey. Participants were a volunteer sample of Brazilian nationality and above 18 years old. For Phase 2, a sub-sample of 55 participants was drawn from the pool of the first phase. Main outcomes and measures: For Phase 1, the primary endpoint was score in the SRQ-20 scale (an instrument to screen symptoms of common mental disorders), and the secondary endpoint was score in an anxiety scale that screened feelings of anxiety related to illness and medical procedures. Results: For Phase 1, 51% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 27.6% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 9.8% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 11.6% reported leaving the house every day. Using SRQ-20, we found that 76.9% of the female respondents and 58.0% of the male respondents that reported leaving their houses less than once a week showed clinically significant symptoms, while these proportions fell below 65% for females and 44% for males that reported leaving their houses more than 3 times per week. Reliance on escape/avoidance as well as distancing coping strategies were significant mediators of the effect of isolation-induced loneliness. We did not find support for the hypothesis that reliance on social support coping strategies significantly altered the effects of social isolation-induced loneliness on psychological distress, nor for the hypothesis that external entrapment moderated the effects of loneliness. We also found that the impact of reliance on positive reappraisal coping strategies on the relationship between frequency of media use for COVID-19-related information and psychological distress depended on the type of media, with individuals which sought information from print or online newspapers, social networks, and podcasts at higher frequencies consistently showing more psychological distress; however, higher levels of positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this impact instead of decreasing it. In Phase 2 (qualitative survey), 47.3% of the sample reported leaving the house less than once a week during the period of the research, 21.8% reported leaving the house 1-2 times per week, 10.9% reported leaving the house 3-4 times per week, and 20% reported leaving the house every day. At the qualitative survey we found that individuals interpreted isolation as producing self-assessment with protective and introspective dimensions, but also ruminative and emotional experiences of distress. Conclusions and relevance: Our results reveal that social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased psychological distress at clinically relevant rates, with loneliness being an important predictor of this effect. We also found that escape-avoidance and distancing coping strategies mediated this effect. Psychological distress was also related to high consumption of COVID-19-related information in social networks, print or online newspapers, and podcasts, but that relying on positive reappraisal coping strategies increased this effect instead of decreasing it. Our results suggest the need for policies that diminish the impact of social isolation on mental health; the need to assess and teach alternative coping strategies in clinical settings; and the need to address the impact of Internet-based sources.","Raíssa Oliveira De Mendonça et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46125-884-F01","20200930","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Affect and Emotion Regulation; media consumption; coping strategies; mental health; covid-19; entrapment; social isolation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 Health Status Scale (CHSS)","This study will explore how COVID-19 impacts physical and mental health among convenience samples taken from the general US adult population to improve health and wellbeing for vulnerable groups. Any knowledge thus gained should clarify how the pandemic has affected the overall physical and mental health of these individuals. The CHSS approach to measuring health status should help evaluate general populational needs, treatments, and programs in the COVID-19 context. Study significance. There is a lack of research on how populational health is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially in the context of physical and mental health functioning among the general population. This study holds significant potential in three main areas. First, the US faces an unprecedented and sweeping pandemic, which threatens both the quality of life and life itself across a broad populational spectrum. It is urgent to enhance our understanding of how COVID-19 affects the general population, which requires a rapid investigation of its widespread effects on physical and mental health. Second, the knowledge gained from exploring the relationship between COVID-19 and physical/mental health status will help design new clinical and community interventions that are tailored to general populational needs. Any new health and welfare interventions must be evaluated based on their actual impact. Third, a reliable, valid, and practical outcome measure is a priority area for understanding the physical and mental health consequences of COVID-19. Although physical and mental health care outcomes can be assessed through a variety of parameters, such as satisfaction and cost, health status is the most important.","Areen Omary","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460A4-CA6-F82","20200930","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Cognitive Reappraisal and Self-Compassion as Emotion Regulation Strategies for Parents during COVID-19: An online RCT","Objective. Parenting during pandemic restrictions places extreme demands on everyday family life, leading to increased stress levels for parents and distressed parent-child interactions. The goal of this RCT study was to investigate whether cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion are helpful emotion regulation (ER) strategies to reduce individual and parental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method. An online intervention for parents was developed focusing on the application of ER strategies to pandemic requirements of families. N = 265 participants were randomly assigned to either cognitive reappraisal (CR; n = 88), self-compassion (SC; n = 90) or wait-list control (WLC; n = 87) group. Interventions included two video sessions (day 1 and day 3) and three email reminders to transfer the application of ER strategies to daily family life (days 2, 4, 5). Parents’ perceived individual stress and parental stress were assessed at baseline (T0), at T1 prior to the booster session, and at T2 (7 days after baseline). Results. Significant decreases from T0 to T2 emerged for both primary stress outcomes in both intervention groups. Individual stress significantly decreased in CR compared to WLC at T2. No time × group interactions for parental stress were found. However, mediation analyses suggested that parental stress was indirectly decreased via reductions in individual stress for CR compared to WLC at both time points. Conclusions. COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic to affect family life. Cognitive reappraisal as brief online intervention can ease acute stress and strengthen the mental health of parents in acute crises.","Hanna Preuss et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-A04-9DF","20200916","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; online intervention; self-compassion; randomized controlled trial; pandemic; emotion regulation; cognitive reappraisal; rct; stress; covid-19; parental stress; corona virus","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Child, parent, and family mental health and functioning in Australia during COVID-19: Comparison to pre-pandemic data","The COVID-19 pandemic presents significant risks to the mental health and wellbeing of families. This study aimed to examine: (1) patterns of parent and child (0–18 years) mental health, parent substance use, couple conflict, parenting practices, and family functioning during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic data; and (2) associations between parent, child, and family outcomes during the pandemic and both pre-existing risk factors and COVID-19 stressors. Participants were Australian mothers (81%) and fathers aged 18 years and over who were parents of a child 0–18 years (N=2,365). Parents completed an online self-report survey assessing mental health, substance use, couple conflict, parenting, and family functioning during ‘stage three’ COVID-19 restrictions in April 2020. Data were compared to pre-pandemic data from four Australian population-based cohorts. Compared to pre-pandemic estimates, during the pandemic period parents reported higher rates of parent mental health symptoms (Cohen’s d=0.26-.81, all p<.001), higher parenting irritability (d=0.17-.46, all p<.001), lower family positive expressiveness (d=-0.18, p<.001), and higher alcohol consumption (22% vs 12% drinking four or more days per week, p<.001). In multivariable analyses, pre-existing financial deprivation and COVID-19 stressors were associated with greater severity in parent and child mental health symptoms, parent emotion dysregulation, parenting irritability, couple conflict and family positive/negative expressiveness. Parents and children with pre-existing mental health conditions had elevated difficulties during the pandemic across most domains. Our data suggest wide-ranging, detrimental family impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic; and support policy actions to assist families with financial supports, leave entitlements, and social housing.","Elizabeth Westrupp et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46001-3E8-FF4","20200930","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; child; tobacco; child mental health; mother; family functioning; couple conflict; smoking; covid-19 pandemic; parenting; parenting irritability; mental health; alcohol; father","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

This virus has impacted in a way that has imposed mandatory lockdowns in many countries including India. However, since the lockdown has been imposed, attention is being focussed on the economic repercussions, migrants and livelihoods. Mental health issues such as anxiety, worry, fear of infection, sleep disturbance and in some cases suicide are side lined.

"From ‘It has stopped our lives’ to ‘Spending more time together has strengthened bonds': The varied experiences of Australian families during COVID-19","The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8th and April 28th, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including: 'Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion'; 'Families are missing the things that keep them healthy'; 'Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy'; 'The unprecedented demands of parenthood'; 'The unequal burden of COVID-19'; and 'Holding on to positivity'. Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude and tolerance.","Subhadra Evans et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4619E-3AE-DF5","20200817","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; qualitative; social restrictions; covid-19; australia; family relationships","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in an International Sample: Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms and the Role of Fatalism","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is a global emergency affecting millions of people and their mental health. We aimed to assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) during the COVID-19 outbreak in an international sample and to explore the role of fatalism in behavior modification and psychological distress. Data for the study were collected via an anonymous online survey. The survey included questions about demographic characteristics, health status, the impact of COVID-19 on health and behavior, pandemic-related stress, as well as fatalism. Traumatic impact of the pandemic was assessed by the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). The sample included 465 participants from 30 different countries (mean age = 36.87, SD = 13.39, age range = 18 – 76; 80% female). Study participants were significantly affected by the pandemic. While none of the study participants have been diagnosed with COVID-19, almost 25% knew someone who had received the diagnosis. The overwhelming majority (79%) had to make changes to their daily routine, and 48.82% of the sample reported moderate to severe traumatic impact of the pandemic. Fatalism was found to be a statistically significant predictor of PTSS in a multiple regression model and was also associated with a lack of behavior modification in response to the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event with a potential to affect the mental health and well-being of individuals and communities. Our findings also indicate that public health interventions should take into account the negative impact of fatalism on behavior modification.","Olga Bogolyubova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4615A-020-15D","20200818","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; traumatic stress; mental health; covid-19; coronavirus; ptss; posttraumatic stress symptoms; fatalism","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

But there were others whom I have followed up for longer periods, and I have reported three such cases of drug resistant depression, who were utterly hopeless but showed a sharp improvement with MACI. In common mental illnesses (depression and anxiety, alcohol and tobacco use), such sharp improvements are often observed with MACI.

"Addressing COVID-19 Worry and Social Isolation in Home-Based Primary Care","Social distancing measures following the outbreak of COVID-19 have led to a rapid shift to virtual and telephone care. Social workers and mental health providers in VA home-based primary care (HBPC) teams face challenges providing psychosocial support to their homebound, medically complex, socially isolated patient population who are high risk for poor health outcomes related to COVID-19. We developed and disseminated an 8-week telephone or virtual group intervention for front-line HBPC social workers and mental health providers to use with socially isolated, medically complex older adults. The intervention draws on skills from evidence-based psychotherapies for older adults including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, and Problem-Solving Therapy. The manual was disseminated to VA HBPC clinicians and geriatrics providers across the United States in March 2020 for expeditious implementation. Eighteen HBPC teams and three VA Primary Care teams reported immediate delivery of a local virtual or telephone group using the manual. In this paper we describe the manual’s development and clinical recommendations for its application across geriatric care settings. Future evaluation will identify ways to meet longer-term social isolation and evolving mental health needs for this patient population as the pandemic continues.","Rachel Elizabeth Weiskittle et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460DB-0C0-3C1","20200825","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Aging; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19: An online cross-sectional survey among Bangladeshi residents","The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19) rapidly infects people across the world, leading to a massive public reaction. Peoples’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 are the most important for the control and prevention of the pandemic infectious disease. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude & practices (KAP) towards measures for prevention of the spread of COVID-19 among Bangladeshi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey of 1765 respondents was conducted through the social media networks of authors. The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD: 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD: 1.8, ranging: 0-17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. About 67.2 % scored well (above the mean: 4.5, range: 1-5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wear mask outside the home, and 98.7% washed hand with soap when came back. COVID-19 knowledge score was significantly associated with a lower risk of (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.92) of negative attitudes. Again, the awareness score was associated with a lower likelihood of (OR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.87-0.98) of poor practices.

"Mental health difficulties of adults with COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh: a case control-study","Introduction The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 coupled with inefficient testing capacities in Bangladesh has resulted in a number of deaths from COVID-19-like symptoms that have no official test results. Insufficient test sites and healthcare facilities catered to COVID-19 has led to feelings of fear and frustration in those who are sick. This study was the first study which explored the mental health of adults with the most common COVID-19-like symptoms in Bangladesh. Methods This retrospective case control study gathered data via an online survey to explore the mental health of Bangladeshi adults with symptoms akin to COVID-19. Level of stress, anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms were measured with the DASS-21. Chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence rates of anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms of overall population were 26.9% and 52.0% respectively and 55.6% reported mild to extremely severe levels of stress. Multivariate logistic regression determined that respondents with COVID-19-like symptoms (case) reported higher odds for stress level (AOR: 2.043; CI: 1.51-2.76), anxiety symptoms (AOR: 2.770; CI: 2.04-3.77) and depressive symptoms (AOR: 1.482; CI: 1.12-1.96) than asymptomatic respondents (control).

"A COVID-19 descriptive study of life after lockdown in Wuhan, China","On April 8th, 2020, the Chinese government lifted the lockdown and opened up public transportation in Wuhan, China, the epicentre of the COVID-19 pandemic. After 76 days in lockdown, Wuhan residents were allowed to travel outside of the city and go back to work. Yet, given that there is still no vaccine for the virus, this leaves many doubting whether life will indeed go back to normal. The aim of this research was to track longitudinal changes in motivation for self-isolating, life structured, indicators of well-being and mental health after lockdown was lifted. We have recruited 462 participants in Wuhan, China, prior to lockdown lift between the 3rd and 7th of April, 2020 (Time 1), and have followed up with 292 returning participants between 18th and 22nd of April, 2020 (Time 2), 284 between 6th and 10th of May, 2020 (Time 3), and 279 between 25th and 29th of May, 2020 (Time 4). This 4-wave study used latent growth models to examine how Wuhan residents’ psychological experiences change (if at all) within the first two months after lockdown was lifted. The Stage 1 manuscript associated with this submission received in-principle acceptance (IPA) on 2 June 2020. Following IPA, the accepted Stage 1 version of the manuscript was preregistered on the OSF at https://osf.io/g2t3b. This preregistration was performed prior to data analysis. Generally, our study found that: 1) a majority of people still continue to value self-isolation after lockdown was lifted; 2) by the end of lockdown, people perceived gradual return to normalcy and restored structure of everyday life; 3) the psychological well-being slightly improved after lockdown was lifted; 4) people who utilized problem-solving and help-seeking as coping strategies during lockdown had better well-being and mental health by the end of the lockdown; 5) those who experienced more disruptions in daily life during lockdown would display more indicators of psychological ill-being by the end of the lockdown.","Tong Zhou et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46101-51B-49F","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Well-being; well-being; stress; mental health; covid-19; coping","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Standalone smartphone CBT-based Ecological Momentary Interventions to increase mental health - a narrative review","Introduction: A growing number of psychological interventions are delivered via smartphone with the aim to increase the efficacy and effectiveness of these treatments and provide scalable access to interventions for improving mental health. Most of the scientifically tested apps are based on cognitive behavioural therapy principles which are considered as a gold standard for the treatment of many mental health problems. Objective: This review aimed to investigate standalone smartphone-based ‘ecological momentary interventions’ (EMIs) to improve mental health, that were built based on principles derived from cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Methods: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and PubMed databases for peer-reviewed studies published between 1st January 2007 and 15th January 2020. We included studies with a focus on standalone app-based approaches to improve mental health and their feasibility, and/or efficacy and/or effectiveness. Both within- and between-group designs and studies with both healthy and clinical samples were included. Blended interventions, e.g., app-based treatments in combination with psychotherapy, were not included. Selected studies were evaluated in terms of their design, i.e., choice of the control condition, sample characteristics, EMI content, EMI delivery characteristics, feasibility, efficacy and effectiveness. The latter was defined in terms of improvement in primary outcomes used in the studies. Results: A total of 26 studies were selected. The results show that EMIs based on CBT principles can be successfully delivered, significantly increase well-being among users, and reduce mental health symptoms. Standalone EMIs were rated as helpful (m=70.8%), and outcomes were satisfying by users (m=72.6%). Conclusions: Study quality was heterogeneous, and feasibility was often not reported in the reviewed studies, hence limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing data. Together, the studies show that EMIs may help increase mental health and thus support individuals in their daily life. Such EMIs provide readily available, scalable and evidence-based mental health support. These characteristics appear crucial in the context of a global crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but may also help reduce personal and economic costs of mental health impairment beyond this situation or in the context of potential future pandemics.","Marta Anna Marciniak et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46040-8DA-A42","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; mhealth; covid-19; emi; cbt; mobile app; cognitive behavioral therapy; ecological momentary intervention","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychosocial effects of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic: Differences between seven European countries and between children with and without mental health conditions","The aim of the present study was to examine parental experiences of homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic in families with or without a child with a mental health condition across Europe. The study included 6720 parents (2002 parents with a child with a mental health condition and 4718 without) from seven European countries: the United Kingdom (n=508), Sweden (n=1436), Spain (n=1491), Belgium (n=508), the Netherlands (n=324), Germany (n=1662) and Italy (n=794). Many parents found homeschooling to be of poor quality, with insufficient support from schools and general negative effects on both children and parents. In most countries, online teaching was uncommon, leaving parents with primary responsibility for managing their child’s schooling. Parents also reported increased levels of stress, worry, social isolation, and domestic conflict. A small number of parents reported increased parental alcohol/drug use. Some differences were found between countries and some effects were more pronounced in families with a child with a mental health condition. However, group differences were generally small, indicating that negative effects were present in many families across countries. It should also be noted that some parents reported positive effects of homeschooling for their child or themselves. The adverse effects of homeschooling will likely have a long-term impact and contribute to increased inequalities. Given that school closures have been argued to be less effective than other social distancing interventions, policymakers need to carefully consider the negative consequences of homeschooling during a possible second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.","Lisa Thorell et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4602D-DEA-E25","20200924","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; psychosocial effects; mental health problems; homeschooling; covid-19","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Prevalence and correlates of anxiety and depression in frontline healthcare workers treating people with COVID-19 in Bangladesh","Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) who are in the frontline during the COVID-19 pandemic are often under significant pressures which may predispose them to mental ill-health. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of anxiety and depression among HCWs and factors correlated with mental problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between July and August 2020. A self-reported online questionnaire was utilized to collect data. The survey included questions concerning socio-demographic, lifestyle, and work setting and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Data from 803 HCWs (50.7% male; mean age: 27.3 [SD=6.9]; age range: 18-58 years) were included in analyses. Prevalence estimates of anxiety and depression were, respectively, 69.5% and 39.5% for at least borderline abnormal, 41.2% and 15.7% for at least abnormal symptoms. Regression analyses with HADS-score as dependent variable revealed significant (p<0.05) associations with female sex, moderate and poor health status, irregular physical exercising, smoking, having had regrets about their profession because of the pandemic and many unexpected experiences, not updating on the latest COVID-19-related research, experiencing discrimination in the workplace, and facing social problems due to working in a lab or hospital. Conclusions: Symptoms of mental ill-health are prevalent among HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The findings suggest a need for monitoring and early interventions to help these individuals.","Rafia Tasnim et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461CF-004-65D","20200923","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; healthcare workers; anxiety; covid-19; bangladesh; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Disordered Social Media Use and Fear of COVID-19 and the Association with Stress and Depression","The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global threat that has negative impacts on individuals’ physical and mental health. Here, we explore if disordered social media use promotes fear of COVID-19, which in turn increases stress and depression in users. The study also explores several risk and protective factors that may affect the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and stress and depression. There were 174 participants that completed an online survey that measured disordered social media use, fear of COVID-19, perceived stress, and depression symptomatology. We found that disordered social media use predicts perceived stress indirectly through fear of COVID-19. Disordered social media use had a direct relationship with depression scores and this relationship is mediated by fear of COVID-19. We also found that the positive relationship between fear of COVID-19 and perceived stress is stronger for older people than younger people. The psychological impact of COVID-19 may be exacerbated by content promoting the fear of COVID-19 that users will be exposed to on social media.","Gabriel Tillman","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4604E-981-0EB","20200923","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology, other; stress; covid-19; social media; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Delay discounting and under-valuing of recent information predict lower adherence to social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented changes in the day-to-day behaviours of populations globally, especially in areas where social distancing rules have been mandated. Understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying (un)successful behaviour change around social distancing is crucial to inform public health policy for both the current and future crises. In this study, we utilise tasks probing delay discounting (the preference for immediate versus delayed rewards) and patch foraging (evaluating the trade-off between exploiting a known resource and exploring an unknown one) to investigate cognitive predictors of social distancing and mental health symptoms. Participants (N=442) were recruited from a large UK cohort (N=2025) nationally representative in age, gender and income. Greater sensitivity to reward magnitude during delay discounting predicted lower adherence to social distancing measures and higher levels of mood and anxiety symptoms. In addition, under-valuing recently sampled information during foraging separately predicted greater violation of social distancing. Analyses examining cognitive factors underpinning social distancing behaviour across two time points (early and late phases of the pandemic) additionally revealed that greater sensitivity to magnitude of rewards on offer during delay discounting predicted a greater decline in psychological inclination to maintain social distancing. Moreover, under-valuing recent information during foraging separately predicted less motivation to engage in social distancing during the established phase of the pandemic. The findings suggest that those who typically regulate their mood through behaviours that bring about immediate reward are also those who struggle to maintain social distancing. Further, those who adapt more quickly to new information showed better ability to change their behaviour in response to public health measures. These findings highlight the need for public health initiatives that bolster sustained confidence in planning around social distancing by emphasising the immediate rewards to self as well as longer term benefits.","Alex Lloyd et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46225-88E-782","20200922","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Judgment and Decision Making; decision-making; coronavirus; patch; social distancing; covid-19; delay discounting; foraging","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The psychological distress in students during the COVID-19 crisis: An 8-wave longitudinal study","The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in psychological distress during initial stage of the coronavirus pandemic in Croatia. The sample consisted of 363 students with an average age of 23.42 years. The results show that students in Croatia reported average levels of depression, anxiety and stress, with no differences in the degree of psychological distress between the pre-pandemic period and the pandemic period. Of the respondents, 19.48%, 28.8% and 22.08% respectively reported moderate to severe depression, anxiety and stress, which remained largely stable during the survey period. All significant differences during the 8-week period show that depression, anxiety and stress generally decrease over time.","Anita Vulic-Prtoric et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4611F-19C-F12","20200829","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; anxiety; stress; longitudinal study; students; covid -19 pandemic; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19: A Boon or a Bane for Creativity?","In many countries, the COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of lockdown that impacted individual’s lifestyles, in both professional and personal spheres. New problems and challenges arose, as well as opportunities. Numerous studies have examined the negative effects of lockdown measures, but few have attempted to shine light on the potential positive effects that may come out of these measures. We focused on one particular positive outcome that might have emerged from lockdown: creativity. To this end, this paper compared professional creativity (Pro-C) and everyday creativity (little-c) before and during lockdown, using a questionnaire-based study conducted on a French sample (N = 1266). We expected participants to be more creative during than prior to lockdown, in both professional and everyday spheres. Regarding professional creativity, we did not see any significant differences between the two comparison points, before and during lockdown. Regarding everyday creativity, we observed a significant increase during lockdown. Furthermore, our results suggest that participants with a lower baseline creativity (before lockdown) benefited more from the situation than those with a higher initial baseline creativity. Our results provide new insights on the impact of lockdown and its positive outcomes. These measures may have inarguably negative consequences on the physical and mental health of many, but their positive impact exists as well.","Maxence Mercier et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AC-44D-278","20200901","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology|Creativity; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Industrial and Organizational Psychology|Innovation and Technology; covid-19; creativity development; creativity; pro-c; little-c; positive outcome; lockdown","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"ABC framework of fear of COVID-19 for psychotherapeutic intervention in Nepal: a review","The COVID-19 pandemic is having an impact on physical and mental health. Most studies report the impact on mental health and mental distress during the pandemic. As a result of various stressors (such as lockdown, quarantines, and misinformation) there is heightened fear of a pandemic. The sufferer may experience a variety of symptoms of anxiety, depression, and even psychosis. In predisposed vulnerable individuals, fear of COVID-19 is perpetuating pain and dysfunction. This study discussed the ABC framework of fear and influencer to better understand the different levels of symptoms and interventions. There is an urgent need to integrate mental health into primary health-care centers. The attending physician should be aware of the stress disorders associated with the pandemic. This article introduces a handy and practical portrayal of the ABC framework that can be taught to individuals in distress during clinical visits to primary care centers providing awareness of the relationship between thinking, emotional and behavioral responses.","Dhirendra Paudel","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461C8-025-8F0","20200904","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Assessment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Mental Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotherapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Therapy; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cultural Psychology; phobia; abc; coronaphobia; anxiety; depression; psychotherapy","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Deterioration of mental health despite successful control of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea","South Korea was able to successfully control the spread of COVID-19 without nationwide lockdowns or drastic social distancing efforts, but pandemic-related psychological outcome of the general population remains unknown. We aimed to document the mental health outcome in relation to social factors during the pandemic. Between March and June 2020, 400 South Korean residents participated in an online study of depression, anxiety, stress, psychosis-risk and loneliness, as well as indices of social network, physical health and demographics. Clinical levels of depression, anxiety or stress were reported by 45% of the respondents, and psychosis-risk was present in 12.8%; a drastic increase above the base rate prior to the pandemic. Subjective feelings of loneliness, but not the size of the social network accounted for poor mental health. Women were especially at increased risk for mental health problems. Thus, despite effective mitigation of the pandemic, there was a striking deterioration of mental health. As the psychological burden of the continuing pandemic accrues, the probability of an impending mental health crisis is increasing, especially in countries with greater infection and death rates than South Korea. Comprehensive efforts to address the psychological aftermath of the pandemic are urgently needed.","Hyeon-Seung Lee et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46091-F8D-4FA","20200830","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Depressive Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Psychotic Disorders; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Emotion; loneliness; korea; stress; depression; anxiety; social isolation; psychosis; covid-19; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Child and parent physical activity, sleep and screen time during COVID-19 compared to pre-pandemic nationally representative data and associations with mental health","Objective: To investigate differences in movement behaviors (physical activity, sleep, screen time) in both parents and children during the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, compared to pre-COVID-19 national data; and, estimate associations between these movement behaviors with parent and child mental health. Methods: We used cross-sectional baseline data from the COVID-19 Pandemic Adjustment Study (CPAS; N=2,365). Participants were parents of children aged =18 years, residing in Australia. We drew on nationally representative pre-COVID data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC; N=9,438). In both studies, parents provided the same self-report measures of physical activity, sleep quality, as well as measures of child physical activity and screen time. Parents reported on their own and their child’s mental health. Results: Compared to LSAC, children in CPAS had more sleep problems (17.4% vs 8.9%, p<.001) and more weekend screen time (3.98 hours vs 3.35 hours, p<.001), while more parents had poor sleep quality (56.7% vs 21.0%, p<.001) despite increased weekly physical activity (3.86 days vs 2.85 days, p<.001). Children’s sleep problems were associated with increased depression, anxiety and irritability symptoms, after accounting for physical activity and screen time (all p<.001). Poorer parent sleep quality and lower levels of physical activity were associated with poorer mental health across all indicators (all p=.001). Conclusion: Government funded mental health programs to implement evidence-based sleep interventions for children and their parents, along with targeted messaging around physical activity should be considered to promote mental health within the family context during lockdown restrictions.","Lisa Olive et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46046-C6F-F9C","20200902","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; anxiety; adult; parent; mental health; screen-time; children; depression; family; covid-19; sleep; physical activity","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The role of personality in shaping pandemic response: Systemic sociopolitical factors drive country differences","The current study utilizes the current COVID-19 pandemic to highlight the importance of accounting for the influence of external political and economic factors in personality public-health research. We investigated the extent to which systemic factors modify the relationship between personality and pandemic response. Results shed doubt on the cross-cultural generalizability of common big-five factor models. Individual differences only predicted government compliance in autocratic countries and in countries with income inequality. Personality was only predictive of mental health outcomes under conditions of state fragility and autocracy. Finally, there was little evidence that the big five traits were associated with preventive behaviors. Our ability to use individual differences to understand policy-relevant outcomes changes based on environmental factors and must be assessed on a trait-by-trait basis, thus supporting the inclusion of systemic political and economic factors in individual differences models.","Meghan Siritzky et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4607A-8FA-A5B","20200831","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Individual Differences; democracy; gini; personality; autocracy; pandemic; polity; covid-19; state fragility; health behavior; individual differences","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

In this study, we show that self-perceived loneliness coincides with objective measures of social isolation as well as the personality trait neuroticism, and that these comorbidities contribute to differential associations with risk factors including depression, social deprivation, unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, cardiovascular risk, and aging of the brain. The findings contribute to identifying groups of individuals who may be vulnerable to loneliness and associated health problems, and emphasize the need for public-health initiatives addressing socioeconomic conditions as well as social, mental, and physical health to reduce the risk of loneliness and adverse health outcomes in the population.","Ann-Marie G De Lange et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-183-FF0","20200921","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Neuroscience|Behavioral Neuroscience; PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Health-related Behavior; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Social health; lifestyle behavior; depression; mental health; cardiovascular risk; risk factors; neuroticism; brain aging; loneliness; social isolation","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Experiences, impacts and mental health functioning during a COVID-19 outbreak and lockdown: Data from a diverse New York City sample of college students","In March 2020, New York City (NYC) experienced an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which resulted in a 78-day mass confinement of all residents other than essential workers. The aims of the current study were to (1) document the breadth of COVID-19 experiences and their impacts on college students of a minority-serving academic institution in NYC; (2) explore associations between patterns of COVID-19 experiences and psychosocial functioning during the prolonged lockdown, and (3) explore sex and racial/ethnic differences in COVID-19-related experiences and mental health correlates. A total of 911 ethnically and racially diverse students completed an online survey in May 2020. Findings highlight significant impediments to multiple areas of students’ daily life during this period (i.e., home life, work life, social environment, and emotional and physical health) and a vast majority reported heightened symptoms of depression and generalized anxiety. Each of these life disruptions were significantly related to poorer mental health. Moreover, those who reported the loss of a close friend or loved one from COVID-19 (17%) experienced significantly more psychological distress than counterparts with other types of infection-related histories. Nonetheless, the majority (96%) reported at least one positive experience since the pandemic began. Our findings add to a growing understanding of COVID-19 impacts on psychological health and contribute the important perspective of the North American epicenter of the pandemic during the time frame of this investigation. We discuss how the results may inform best practices to support students’ well-being and serve as a benchmark for future studies of student populations facing COVID-19 and its aftermath.","Teresa Lopez-Castro et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4609E-F5E-885","20200904","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Trauma and Stress; anxiety; mass confinement; college students; depression; gender differences; ptsd; covid-19; racial/ethnic differences; mental health","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Supporting Families to Protect Child Health: Parenting Quality and Household Needs During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Supportive parenting is critical for promoting healthy child development in the face of stressors, such as those occurring during COVID-19. Here, we address a knowledge gap regarding specific household risk factors associated with parenting quality during the pandemic and incorporate first-person accounts of family challenges and needs. Methods: Mixed methods were applied to data collected between April 14th - 28th, 2020 from the “Parenting During the Pandemic” survey. Participants included 656 primary caregivers (e.g., mothers, fathers, foster parents) of least one child age 1.5-8 years of which 555 (84.6%) responded to at least one parenting questionnaire. Parenting quality was assessed across stressful, negative, and positive parenting dimensions. Household risk was examined across pandemic-linked (e.g., caregiver depression, unmet childcare needs) and stable factors (i.e., annual income, mental illness history). Significant correlates were examined with regressions in Mplus. Thematic analysis identified caregiver challenges and unmet needs from open-ended questions. Findings: Caregiver depression, higher child parity, unmet childcare needs, and relationship distress predicted lower-quality parenting. Caregiver depression was the most significant predictor across every parenting dimension, with analyses indicating medium effect sizes, ds = .39 - .73. Qualitative findings highlighted severe strains on parent capacities including managing psychological distress, limited social supports, and too much unstructured time. Interpretations: Lower quality parenting during COVID-19 is associated with multiple household and pandemic risk factors, with caregiver depression consistently linked to parent-child relationship disruptions. Focused efforts are needed to address caregiver mental health to protect child health as part of the pandemic response.","Leslie E Roos et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46130-C20-32A","20200904","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Attachment; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Early Childhood; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; parenting; psychology; covid; maternal-child health; family; mental health; child development; depression","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The predictive effect of quarantine regulations and anxiety on curiosity during the emerging infectious disease outbreak","With the world-wide implementation of quarantine to suppress the spread of the COVID-19, people, having weathering a hard time, are confronted with an alarming state of mental health. For people who have taken self-quarantine at home for a long time, the anxiety and the new “staying home normality” may undermine their desire to seek information and thus might have negative effects on their curiosity. Here, we explored and examined how anxiety and the effect of quarantine regulations during the public health emergency predict different kinds of curiosity. With 1071 participants, we conducted an exploratory study (N = 570) and a confirmatory study (N = 501), with measures of anxiety, curiosity, interpersonal distancing and autistic tendency etc. There are three main findings in our results: (1) trait anxiety had negatively indirect impact on trait curiosity and the time spent on update of the COVID-19 information, however, no such correlation was found between state anxiety and epistemic curiosity; (2) state anxiety has negatively indirect impact on perceptual curiosity through increasing interpersonal distancing during quarantine; (3) interpersonal distancing and autistic tendency have negatively indirect impact on interpersonal curiosity. These effects suppressed the positive prediction of anxiety to interpersonal curiosity. Our research provides insights for the relationship between quarantine, anxiety and curiosity during the COVID-19.","Qi Huang et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46111-9BD-9D8","20200920","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; quarantine; curiosity; interpersonal distancing; anxiety; covid-19; autism","PsyArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental Health and Economic Concerns from March to May during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Canada","Background The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the psychological wellbeing of populations worldwide. In this study, we assess changes in mental health during the early months of the pandemic in Canada and examine its relationship with another prominent problem during this time, economic concerns. Methods Analyses were based on two nationally representative cross-sectional surveys from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series (N=4,627 in March and 4,600 in May). We described the changes in mental health and economic concerns between March and May, and assessed the relationship between the two characteristics. Results Mental health declined significantly during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic: the proportion of Canadian adults who reported only good/fair/poor mental health grew from 46% to 52% from March to May. Economic concerns including food insecurity were an important correlate of ‘bad’ mental health, as was younger age, female gender, and Canada-born status. Contrary to expectations, however, economic concerns lessened during this time frame. Conclusions These findings suggest that policies to mitigate economic stress, such as Canada’s Emergency Response Benefit, may have eased mental health deterioration in early pandemic months through a reduction in financial hardship. Interventions to increase the economic security of the population will have far-reaching consequences in terms of improved mental health, and should be continued throughout the pandemic.","Anna Zajacova et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46240-EB2-6C5","20201018","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; covid-19; canada; economic; mental health; adults","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"“My Husband Thinks I’m Crazy”: COVID-19-Related Conflict in Couples with Young Children","Objective: We examine how disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic are creating conflicts for couples with young children. Background: National polls suggest that COVID-19 has led to increased conflict for couples in the U.S. Although scholars have not examined the source of these new conflicts, pre-pandemic research suggests that pandemic-related disruptions may create conflicts around paid work and parenting, economic security, politics, and health decision-making. Method: This study uses the Pandemic Parenting Study, a mixed-methods study of Southern Indiana mothers, conducted April-May 2020, and involving surveys (N=139), diary entries (N=104), and in-depth interviews (N=65). We examine mothers’ reports of pandemic-related changes in their frustrations with their partners and how those changes vary with the disruptions couples have experienced during the pandemic. We then use qualitative data to understand how pandemic-related disruptions are generating conflicts for couples and what consequences those conflicts have. Results: A substantial minority of mothers (39%) report pandemic-related increases in their frustrations with their partners. These frustrations are particularly common among mothers whose partners are (reportedly) providing insufficient support with pandemic parenting or dismissing mothers’ concerns about COVID-19. Mothers blame themselves for these conflicts and feel responsible for reducing them, including by leaving the workforce, beginning use of antidepressants, or ignoring their own concerns about COVID-19. Conclusion: The pandemic has exacerbated longstanding sources of conflict (related to partners’ insufficient support with parenting) and created new sources of conflict (related to partners’ dismissals of mothers’ concerns about COVID-19), with serious implications for mothers, families, and public health.","Jessica Mccrory Calarco et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46176-680-C96","20201009","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; relationships; work-family; family; conflict; health; decision-making; covid-19; parenthood","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Physically distant but socially close? Changes in intergenerational non-physical contacts during the COVID-19 pandemic among older people in France, Italy and Spain","Keeping physical distance is intended to mitigate the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. However, the impact of a decrease in face-to-face interactions on non-physical social contacts of older people remains unclear. In particular, we focus on intergenerational contacts that are particularly relevant for older people’s mental health implications. Our analyses rely on an on-line representative survey conducted in Italy, Spain and France during April 14-24 2020. We considered the sub-sample of individuals aged 50+ (N=4,207). We calculated post-stratification weights based on official statistics and used logistic regressions to analyse how changes in intergenerational relationships differed by socio-economic factors in the three considered countries and to what extent non-physical contacts (via phone, social media, etc.) have compensated the reduction in physical interactions. Finally, changes in the use of digital devices has been explored as a consequence of both, decreased in physical and increased in non-physical intergenerational contacts. Our findings are relevant to understand changes in intergenerational relationships during the pandemic and to better plan future outbreak responses.","Bruno Arpino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460AD-ACD-44A","20201009","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; family relationships; sars-cov-2; digital contacts; intergenerational relationships; covid; older people; social contacts; coronavirus; intergenerational contacts","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 and the Future of US Fertility: What Can We Learn from Google?","We use data from Google Trends to predict the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on future births in the United States. First, we show that periods of above-normal search volume for Google keywords relating to conception and pregnancy in US states are associated with higher numbers of births in the following months. Excess searches for unemployment keywords have the opposite effect. Second, by employing simple statistical learning techniques, we demonstrate that including information on keyword search volumes in prediction models significantly improves forecast accuracy over a number of cross-validation criteria. Third, we use data on Google searches during the COVID-19 pandemic to predict changes in aggregate fertility rates in the United States at the state level through February 2021. Our analysis suggests that between November 2020 and February 2021, monthly US births will drop sharply by approximately 15%. For context, this would be a 50% larger decline than that following the Great Recession of 2008-2009, and similar in magnitude to the declines following the Spanish Flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and the Great Depression. Finally, we find heterogeneous effects of the COVID-19 pandemic across different types of mothers. Women with less than a college education, as well as Black or African American women, are predicted to have larger declines in fertility due to COVID-19. This finding is consistent with elevated caseloads of COVID-19 in low-income and minority neighborhoods, as well as with evidence suggesting larger economic impacts of the crisis among such households.","Joshua Wilde et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46186-A32-3DA","20201007","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; prediction; covid-19; statistical learning; fertility; machine learning; births; google","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Exploring Household Food Security and Malnutrition Risk with Psychosocial Indicators of Healthy Ageing in Place: The Food Train - Eat Well Age Well Partnership Project","In Scotland, and United Kingdom, there are stark inequalities in the experience of older age, particularly for those with limited social contact, poorer health, located in deprived neighbourhoods (Centre for Ageing Better 2015). This mixed-methodology research, reports survey findings with n=169 community dwelling older adults in Scotland (average age 79.5), supported with qualitative interviews to evidence the underexplored connection between food insecurity and physiological risk indicators of undernutrition (malnutrition), with psychosocial indicators of healthy ageing. Findings are grounded in collaboration with a third sector social enterprise – Food Train, who provide food shopping and volunteer meal making for those aged 65+. Findings revealed correlations between food insecurity and early indicators of malnutrition risk with poorer wellbeing, and social connectedness. Supported food access mitigates the negative cycle of food insecurity on mental health, via empowerment (locus of control) over one’s life. Qualitative findings suggest that risks of food insecurity may not be financial (food poverty), or attributable to health realities associated with ageing. Rather, psychosocial health and wellbeing diverge as older adults attempt to draw upon available resources, reflective of their own social capital. Mitigators of malnutrition risk includes empowerment through social care located in the third sector, as well as social aspects of food access e.g. social eating, warranting future investigation. These findings are considered post Covid-19, with key policy implications.","Kate Reid et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46194-866-997","20201001","SocArXiv|Arts and Humanities; SocArXiv|Law; SocArXiv|Law|Human Rights Law; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Community Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy; undernutrition; older adult; third sector; social connections; ageing in place; wellbeing; food insecurity; healthy ageing; malnutrition; active ageing","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Changing living arrangements, family dynamics and stress during lockdown: evidence from four birth cohorts in the UK","On 23 March 2020 the UK went into lockdown in an unprecedented step to attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus. Since then, many families have found themselves spending an unprecedented amount of time together, with some facing the additional challenge of adapting to changes in who they are living with as some families have found themselves unexpectedly brought back together. School and university closures, the move to remote working, furlough or the loss of employment have all meant that many adult children who had previously left the parental home have returned. Other individuals have moved to provide care and support for a family member or friend who has been ‘shielding’, and conversely some vulnerable and/or older people have moved in with a younger relative or friend. This paper provides an overview of the changes in living arrangements during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing upon recently available data from five large scale nationally representative surveys, including the second wave of Understanding Society Covid-19 Study, conducted in May 2020 and the special Covid-19 surveys conducted with the participants of the 1958, 1970, 2000-01 British birth cohorts and Next Steps (born in 1989-90). The paper then goes on to explore the impact of the unexpected changes in living arrangements and mental health, as measured by self-reported stress and interpersonal conflict. Data from the Understanding Society May Covid-19 survey shows that for most of the respondents (95.5%) their living arrangements during the three months since 1st March 2020 had not changed. Just over 2% had changed their address and a further 1.5% reported other people had moved in, whilst under 1% reporting people moving out. However, the likelihood of having changed living arrangements varied significantly by age with one in seven of those aged 20-24 reporting a change in living arrangements. Young people aged 16-29 accounted for over half (57%) of all respondents reporting that they had moved themselves. By contrast, respondents in mid-life (45-59) and early later life (60-74) accounted for the majority of respondents reporting other people had moved in or out. Analysis of the cohort data confirmed this picture with nearly a quarter (24%) of the Millennium Cohort Study, currently aged 19 reporting a change in the people they were living with as a result of covid-19, compared to under one in ten of the 1958 cohort, now aged 62. Logistic regression models were used to assess the odds of reporting increased stress and conflict increase amongst those respondents who had experienced a change in living arrangement change compared to those who had not. The results provide strong evidence that those individuals whose living arrangements have changed as a result of the covoid-19 pandemic have a higher likelihood of reported increased stress and family conflict than those whose living arrangements remained unchanged. This has important implications for public health and wider policy as prolonged periods of stress can lead to serious health problems and policy makers need to be mindful that services may need to flex to take these new, albeit for many temporary, forms of living into account.","Maria Evamdrou et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4614F-108-619","20200909","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; stress; cohort; living arrangements; covid-19; pandemic; family relationships","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Escaping to nature in pandemic: a natural experiment of COVID-19 in Asian cities","Cities implemented social distancing measures to cope with COVID-19, which kept people away from nature. A steep drop in the greenspace use was observed in western cities. Surprisingly, news revealed a surging greenspace use in Asian cities. In this study, we used COVID-19 outbreak stages as natural experiments to investigate individual behavioural changes of greenspace use before and during the pandemic. Our case cities are Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo and Seoul. We extracted panel data which consisted of longitudinal posts of 100, 232 users, being posted in 1,185 greenspaces in the four Asian cities. Our statistical models found a 5.3% increase in the odds of people using greenspaces for every 100 additional weekly new cases. The analyses also revealed people’s preference in larger, nature parks that are close to city centres. Due to the established physical and mental health benefits of greenspaces, people have been escaping to nature to cope with the pandemic in Asian cities.","Yi Lu et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461BC-C31-DFA","20200903","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Human-animal relationships and interactions during the Covid-19 lockdown phase in the UK: investigating links with mental health and loneliness","Background: The Covid-19 pandemic raises questions about the role that relationships and interactions between humans and animals play in the context of widespread social distancing and isolation measures. We aimed to investigate links between mental health and loneliness, companion animal ownership, the human-animal bond, and human-animal interactions; and to explore animal owners’ perceptions related to the role of their animals during lockdown. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of UK residents over 18 years of age was conducted between April and June 2020. The questionnaire included validated and bespoke items measuring demographics; exposures and outcomes related to mental health, wellbeing and loneliness; the human-animal bond and human-animal interactions. Results: Of 5,926 participants, 5,323 (89.8%) had at least one companion animal. Most perceived their animals to be a source of considerable support, but concerns were reported related to various practical aspects of providing care during lockdown. Strength of the human-animal bond did not differ significantly between species. Poorer mental health pre-lockdown was associated with a stronger reported human-animal bond (b = -.014, 95% CI [-.023 - -.005], p = .002). Animal ownership compared with non-ownership was associated with smaller decreases in mental health (b = .267, 95% CI [.079 - .455], p = .005) and smaller increases in loneliness (b = -.302, 95% CI [-.461 - -.144], p = .001) since lockdown. Conclusion: The human-animal bond is a construct of potential clinical importance to identify mental health vulnerability in animal owners. Animal ownership appeared to mitigate some of the detrimental psychological effects of lockdown. Further targeted investigation of the role of human-animal relationships and interactions for human health, including testing of the social buffering hypothesis and the development of instruments suited for use across animal species, is required.","Elena Ratschen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46105-AA9-2F9","20200803","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; social distancing &amp; mental health; isolation; covid-19; human-animal bond; human-animal interaction","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Digital screen time during COVID-19 pandemic: A public health concern","The use of digital screens, including television, computers, mobile phones, and smart devices, can be associated with a wide range of health outcomes. During the COVID-19 pandemic, different population groups may have been adapted to varying levels of screen time, which may have profound implications on their health and wellbeing. The available evidence suggests that screen time is associated with obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, myopia, depression, sleep disorders, and many other noncommunicable diseases. This elevated burden of diseases is prevalent among individuals who have sedentary lifestyles and other unhealthy behaviors that are likely to increase during quarantine or isolation due to COVID-19. As several empirical studies have reported a rising trend of screen time during this pandemic, it is critical to assess the adverse health outcomes that may appear as its long-term consequences globally. Researchers and practitioners need to revisit the available guidelines and incorporate evidence-based interventions for preventing unhealthy screen time among the affected individuals. Such interventions may address not only unhealthy screen use behavior but also promote active lifestyles that may improve health across populations during and after this pandemic.","Abida Sultana et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46184-928-6EC","20200901","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Child Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Developmental Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; covid-19; screen use; screen time; health promotion; coronavirus","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Gender differences in the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on unpaid care work and psychological distress in the UK","School and nursery closures and homeworking during the Covid-19 crisis have resulted in an immediate increase in unpaid care work, particularly for parents. Amongst contemporary couples in the UK, women spent more time than men doing housework, childcare and caring for adults prior to the crisis; thus, lockdown draws new attention to gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work. This study aims to answer how couples in the UK divided childcare and housework during lockdown and whether this is associated with changes in levels of psychological distress. Data for this study come from the April and May waves of Understanding Society Covid-19 study. Psychological distress was measured using the GHQ score (ranges from 0 to 36). Unpaid care work included men and women’s hours spent on childcare and housework and the impact of increased unpaid care work on employment schedules. We found that every week, women spent 5 more hours on housework and 10 more hours on childcare than men during lockdown, and this increased housework and childcare was associated with higher levels of psychological distress for women. One-third of parents adapted their work patterns because of childcare/ homeschooling. Men and women who adapted their work patterns had on average 1.16 and 1.39 higher GHQ scores than those who did not. This association was much stronger if he or she was the only member in the household who adapted their work patterns, or if she was a lone mother. Only 10% of fathers reduced work hours due to care work compared to 20% of mothers. Fathers had more psychological distress if they reduced work hours but she did not, compared to neither reducing work hours. Our research suggests that lockdown has hit people with young families and lone mothers particularly hard in terms of mental health, and continued gender inequality in divisions of unpaid care work during lockdown may be putting women at a greater risk of psychological distress.","Baowen Xue et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461AE-6C7-E11","20200821","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; mental health; covid; lone mothers; domestic work; gender inequality; divisions of unpaid care","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Disequilibrium and COVID-19: Effectively Applying Crisis Intervention","Crisis intervention is widely understood as a response to life-threatening emergencies and therefore often limited in its application to natural disasters, severe physical violence, suicidal ideation, and similarly dangerous incidents. While crisis intervention is appropriate for these scenarios, historical definitions of crisis suggest the term and related interventions have much broader application. The ramifications of the novel coronavirus and related cultural fallout increase vulnerability and impair coping capacity in such a way that individuals are significantly more likely to enter crisis states, demanding a prompt reconsideration of the breadth of this practice technique. Successful application of crisis intervention reduces the long-term psychological implications for individuals encountering sudden loss, unexpected traumas, and other hazards that overwhelm traditional coping strategies, outcomes all made more likely by this pandemic. Crisis intervention is a structured, time-limited, problem-oriented treatment modality that is well suited to a remote practice environment because it is directive in its approach and requires few contacts at a time when client access is potentially limited. This paper examines the course of crisis with or without intervention, assessment and intervention tactics, social work values when applying crisis intervention, and the implications of the use of this modality as it relates to COVID-19.","Stephen Oby","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460D5-7FB-5A9","20200817","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; crisis intervention; coping; crisis; covid-19; disequilibrium; coronavirus","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Functional and Dysfunctional Fear of COVID-19: A Classification Scheme","Worry about COVID-19 is a central topic of research into the social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Worry can be a negative and debilitating experience that damages mental health and discourages healthy re-engagement with the world, but it can also be a problem-solving activity, directing people’s attention to problems, and encouraging them to act accordingly. We present in this paper a way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between “functional fear” and “dysfunctional fear.” Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (adaptive emotions encourage proactive behaviours to reduce the chance of infection) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (quality of life is damaged by the emotional experience or taking ineffective or damaging precautions). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1,000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we compare perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence) for each group, and find a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups. Our findings inform what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote. We conclude with some thoughts on the applicability of our measurement scheme for future research.","Reka Solymosi et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46108-D58-862","20200808","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; risk; wellbeing; worry; covid-19; precautions; re-engagement","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Lifestyle and Mental Health Disruptions During COVID-19","COVID-19 has affected daily life in unprecedented ways. Using a longitudinal dataset linking biometric and survey data from several cohorts of young adults before and during the pandemic (N=685), we document large disruptions to physical activity, sleep, time use, and mental health. At the onset of the pandemic, average steps decline from 9,400 to 4,600 steps per day, sleep increases by about 25-30 minutes per night, time spent socializing declines by over half to less than 30 minutes, and screen time more than doubles to over 5 hours per day. The proportion of participants at risk of clinical depression increases to 65%, over twice the rate in the same population prior to the pandemic. Our analyses suggest that disruption to physical activity is a leading risk factor for depression during the pandemic. However, restoration of those habits--either naturally or through policy intervention--has limited impact on restoring mental well-being.","Giovanni Giuntella et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46013-408-4CF","20200804","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics; covid-19; higher education; depression; sleep; physical activity; health; mental health","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Maintaining contact with blue-green spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic associated with positive mental health","There is growing evidence that exposure to the natural world (blue-green spaces) has potential benefits for mental health and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures adopted to control it provide a natural experiment to investigate the links between nature exposure and mental health under extreme conditions. Using a survey distributed online and based on 6,080 responses, we tested three hypotheses: (1) people will show different levels of symptoms of depression and anxiety depending on the level of lockdown (severity) and ability to maintain contact with outdoor spaces; and (2) where access to outdoor public spaces was restricted, those with access to private outdoor spaces (2a) or even a green-blue nature view (2b) will show fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety and a more positive mood. Lockdown severity significantly affected mental health, while contact with nature helped people to cope with these impacts. The buffering effect of nature was especially relevant for those under strict lockdowns. People perceived that nature helped them to cope with lockdown measures; and emotions were more positive among individuals with accessible outdoor spaces and blue-green elements in their views. These findings can help decision-makers in developing potential future lockdown measures to mitigate the negative impacts, helping people to be more resilient and maintain better mental health.","Sarai Pouso et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46095-496-4DD","20200804","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies; nature’s contributions to people; depression; ecosystem services; anxiety; green-blue infrastructure","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Social capital and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 pandemic is affecting mental health and wellbeing across populations. The continued burden of psychosocial stressors in different contexts necessitates multipronged interventions that address mental health problems and associated disparities. Global evidence suggests that social capital plays a critical role in determining mental health outcomes in communities, which can be leveraged for improving mental health in COVID-19. As communities with better social capital is likely to have a lower burden of mental disorders, it is necessary to assess potential measures to use social capital for mental health promotion in vulnerable populations. The existing forms of social capital may provide social support within and between communities that are critically affected by COVID-19. Alongside faster recovery from socioeconomic challenges, social capital interventions may strengthen the social determinants of mental health and empower communities to alleviate the psychosocial consequences of this pandemic.","Tahmina Tasnim Rodela et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/460B6-B45-166","20200728","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociological Practice and Public Sociology; mental health; coronavirus; psychosocial interventions; covid-19; social capital; mental disorders","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Gender Differences in Telecommuting and Implications for Inequality at Home and Work","The global pandemic has led to an unprecedented shift to remote work that will likely persist to some degree into the future. Telecommuting’s impact on flexibility and work family conflict is a critical question for researchers and policy-makers. Our study addresses this question with data collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis: the 2003-2018 American Time Use Survey (ATUS, N = 19,179) and the April and May 2020 COVID Impact Survey (N = 784). Comparing mothers and fathers who work exclusively at the workplace, exclusively from home, and part-day from home, we describe differences in time spent on housework, childcare, and leisure; the nature of time worked at home; and the subjective experiences of telecommuting. In addition to a broad descriptive portrait, we take advantage of a quasi-experimental design in the ATUS leave supplements to examine time working at home among those who report ever telecommuting, providing estimates of telecommuting’s effect on other uses of time that better approximate causal relationships than prior studies. We find that gender gaps in housework are larger for telecommuters, and, among telecommuters, larger on telecommuting days. Conversely, telecommuting may shrink the gender gap in childcare, particularly among couples with two full time earners, although childcare more frequently impinges upon mothers’ work time.

"Indirect consequences of COVID-19 on people’s lives Findings from an on-line survey in France, Italy and Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has limited individuals’ possibility to meet and socialize with others due to the state of emergency restrictions to movements, events and relations imposed in different countries. Most shops and restaurants have been closed and some economic activities have been seriously damaged. This significant disruption may have contributed to a deterioration of people’s mental health on top of other negative consequences of the pandemic. To better understand the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak on people’s lives we have designed the intergen-COVID online survey (https://sites.google.com/unifi.it/intergen-covid), carried out in France, Italy and Spain between the 14th to the 24th of April 2020. Quota sampling on the population 18-plus and post-stratification weights were used to achieve the alignment between the sample (N = 9,056) and the total population on important socio-demographic characteristics. We collected information on four key domains of individuals’ lives: intergenerational (and other type of) relationships (physical and non-physical; means of communication; frequency, etc.); living arrangements; mental health; events experienced during the lockdown (e.g., income loss, death of relative/friend due to COVID-19, worsened partner relationships, time spent with family); intentions for the future 3 years (e.g., fertility, living parental home, marriage, cohabitation, divorce/separation, retirement). In this paper we provide the main results from this survey, focusing on the first three domains abovementioned. The fourth domain consists of questions applicable to different sub-groups of the population and will be analyzed in separate papers. We show that, despite the general reduction of physical contacts, with low educated people reporting a lower reduction in all kinds of physical contacts, non-physical contacts have significantly increased, especially among women. About 50% of respondents felt sad or depressed more often than usual during the lockdown, but mental health deterioration was found to be heterogeneous and vary with respondents’ age, gender and country. Job and income loss, and worsening of relationships quality were other negative consequences often experienced during the lockdown, especially by younger individuals. Finally, although maintaining physical distance, during the lockdown people have experienced a high level of social connection, emotional support and practical help.","Bruno Arpino et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4603E-788-AD3","20200707","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning; sars-cov-2; physical distancing; consequences of covid-19; covid-19; mental health; social relationships; coronavirus","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Twitter under Storm: Social Media Response Sensitization in the Caribbean","Climate change has led to rising sea levels and warmer sea surface temperatures. These factors contribute greatly to the intensity of hurricanes and floods they provoke. Projections estimate there will be an increase of 45% to 87% in the frequency of Category >4 hurricanes originating in the Atlantic Basin, which typically impact the Caribbean and Continental United States of America. During the 2019 Hurricane Season, there were 20 depressions, 18 storms, 6 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. Through this work, we explored the response on Social Media to these natural phenomena as a function of their trajectory, intensity, and previous exposure of the population to intense natural disasters. Data was collected through the Twitter API. The influences of hurricane proximity and intensity on volume of Social Media production was explored. Hurricane Dorian, with its trajectory strongly threatening the previously exposed Puerto Rico, and eventually causing widespread damage in the Abaco Islands of the Bahamas, presented the strongest case for the evaluation of the dichotomy of responses between populations with differences in previous history of exposure. The landscape of historic hurricane exposure Caribbean has radically changed in recent years. Taking advantage of Big Data to help elucidate these dynamics could be instrumental in the tailoring of emergency preparedness plans and the effective design of mental health first aid strategies.","Danilo T Perez-Rivera et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46030-651-F28","20200630","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology; tropical storm; 2019; bahamas; national hurricane center; karen; abaco islands; dorian; twitter; irma; puerto rico; caribbean; social media; maria; noaa; 2017; hurricane","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Applications of artificial intelligence technologies on mental health research during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted mental health globally. It is essential to deploy advanced research methodologies that may use complex data to draw meaningful inferences facilitating mental health research and policymaking during this pandemic. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies offer a wide range of opportunities to leverage advancements in data sciences in analyzing health records, behavioral data, social media contents, and outcomes data on mental health. Several studies have reported the use of several AI technologies such as vector machines, neural networks, latent Dirichlet allocation, decision trees, and clustering to detect and treat depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, and other mental health problems. The applications of such technologies in the context of COVID-19 is still under development, which calls for further deployment of AI technologies in mental health research in this pandemic using clinical and psychosocial data through technological partnerships and collaborations. Lastly, policy-level commitment and deployment of resources to facilitate the use of robust AI technologies for assessing and addressing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mahbub Hossain et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46110-88F-FED","20200623","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Cognitive Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology; machine learning; covid-19; deep learning; covid19; mental health; artificial intelligence; coronavirus; psychiatric; mental disorders; psychological","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

In this article, we examine the expectations of the economic outlook, fear of the future, and behavioural change during the lockdown, for three European countries (Spain, the United Kingdom, and Italy) that have been severely hit by Covid-19. We use a novel data source that we collected to monitor the three countries during the pandemic. As outcome variables, we use expectations (e.g., economic outlook, labour market situation, recovery), fear (e.g., scenario of new outburst, economic depression, restriction to individual rights and freedom), and behavioural change across the following dimensions: savings, cultural consumption, social capital, and risky behaviour.

"The importance of urban natural areas and urban ecosystem services during the COVID-19 pandemic","Urban, peri-urban forests and other natural areas provide a wide range of material and non-material benefits to people known as ecosystem services. Access to these areas has been linked to improvements in physical and mental health of local populations. In the Spring of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic forced many governments to impose a set of restrictions including the closure of businesses and cancelation of events, social distancing and limitation of gatherings, and movement limitations. During this period of restrictions, we conducted a study assessing the importance of urban and peri-urban forests and other natural areas to people living in and around the city of Burlington, Vermont, USA. We evaluated the use and value changes related to these natural areas before and during the period of restrictions. We received over 400 surveys from the local community. The results show that 69.0% of the respondents had increased or greatly increased their visitation rate to these areas, and 80.6% of respondents considered that the importance of these natural areas and access to them either increased or greatly increased. Moreover 25.8% of the sample had either never, or very rarely accessed their local natural areas before the pandemic, but 69.2% of the first time or infrequent visitors reported that having access to these areas during COVID-19 as ‘very important’. People reported that these areas were important for a wide range of activities from exercise to birding, but also reported values related to reducing stress in a time of global chaos. Our results indicate the increasing demand and value of such areas in times of crisis such as COVID-19. Experts in zoonotic disease predict the potential for more frequent pandemic events, thus predicating the importance for continued funding for, maintenance of and improved access to natural areas to our largely urban civilization.","Brendan Fisher et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461A2-F81-886","20200612","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Political trust during the Covid-19 pandemic: Rally around the flag or lockdown effects?","How can we explain the rise in diffuse political support during the Covid-19 pandemic? Recent research has argued that the lockdown measures generated political support. In contrast, I argue that the intensity of the pandemic rallied people around political institutions. Collective angst in the face of exponentially rising Covid-19 cases depresses the usual cognitive evaluations of institutions, and leads citizens to rally around existing intuitions as a lifebuoy. Using a representative Dutch household survey conducted over March 2020, I compare the lockdown effect to the dynamic of the pandemic. I find that the lockdown effect is driven by pre-existing time trends. Accounting for nonlinearities in time makes the lockdown effect disappear. In contrast, more flexible modelling techniques reveal a robust effect of Covid-19 infections on political trust. Moreover, I find that standard determinants of political trust – such as economic evaluations and social trust – lose explanatory power as the pandemic spreads. This speaks to an emotionally driven rally effect that pushes cognitive evaluations to the background.","Dominik Schraff","https://share.osf.io/preprint/4621E-6CD-E2B","20200608","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science; corona; political support; netherlands; covid-19; political trust","SocArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Feeling Like It is Time to Reopen Now? COVID-19 New Normal Scenarios based on Reopening Sentiment Analytics","The Coronavirus pandemic has created complex challenges and adverse circumstances. This research discovers public sentiment amidst problematic socioeconomic consequences of the lockdown, and explores ensuing four potential sentiment associated scenarios. The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led to the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare challenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of extreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and anticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for effective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using Twitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends associated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual analytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential divergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences of each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual analytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American Twitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the US economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time sensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government, corporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new normal future.","Samuel, Jim; Rahman, Md.

"Analyzing COVID-19 on Online Social Media: Trends, Sentiments and Emotions","At the time of writing, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused severe impacts on society, economy and people's daily lives. People constantly express their opinions on various aspects of the pandemic on social media, making user-generated content an important source for understanding public emotions and concerns. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis on the affective trajectories of the American people and the Chinese people based on Twitter and Weibo posts between January 20th, 2020 and May 11th 2020. Specifically, by identifying people's sentiments, emotions (i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise) and the emotional triggers (e.g., what a user is angry/sad about) we are able to depict the dynamics of public affect in the time of COVID-19. By contrasting two very different countries, China and the Unites States, we reveal sharp differences in people's views on COVID-19 in different cultures. Our study provides a computational approach to unveiling public emotions and concerns on the pandemic in real-time, which would potentially help policy-makers better understand people's need and thus make optimal policy.","Li, Xiaoya; Zhou, Mingxin; Wu, Jiawei; Yuan, Arianna; Wu, Fei; Li, Jiwei","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200529",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"How Does COVID-19 impact Students with Disabilities/Health Concerns?","The impact of COVID-19 on students has been enormous, with an increase in worries about fiscal and physical health, a rapid shift to online learning, and increased isolation. In addition to these changes, students with disabilities/health concerns may face accessibility problems with online learning or communication tools, and their stress may be compounded by additional risks such as financial stress or pre-existing conditions. To our knowledge, no one has looked specifically at the impact of COVID-19 on students with disabilities/health concerns. In this paper, we present data from a survey of 147 students with and without disabilities collected in late March to early April of 2020 to assess the impact of COVID-19 on these students' education and mental health. Our findings show that students with disabilities/health concerns were more concerned about classes going online than their peers without disabilities. In addition, students with disabilities/health concerns also reported that they have experienced more COVID-19 related adversities compared to their peers without disabilities/health concerns. We argue that students with disabilities/health concerns in higher education need confidence in the accessibility of the online learning tools that are becoming increasingly prevalent in higher education not only because of COVID-19 but also more generally. In addition, educational technologies will be more accessible if they consider the learning context, and are designed to provide a supportive, calm, and connecting learning environment.","Zhang, Han; Nurius, Paula; Sefidgar, Yasaman; Morris, Margaret; Balasubramanian, Sreenithi; Brown, Jennifer; Dey, Anind K.; Kuehn, Kevin; Riskin, Eve; Xu, Xuhai; Mankoff, Jen","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200511",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 Public Opinion and Emotion Monitoring System Based on Time Series Thermal New Word Mining","With the spread and development of new epidemics, it is of great reference value to identify the changing trends of epidemics in public emotions.

A new word structure discovery scheme based on the timing explosion of network topics and a Chinese sentiment analysis method for the COVID-19 public opinion environment is proposed. Establish a""Scrapy-Redis-Bloomfilter""distributed crawler framework to collect data. The system can judge the positive and negative emotions of the reviewer based on the comments, and can also reflect the depth of the seven emotions such as Hopeful, Happy, and Depressed. Finally, we improved the sentiment discriminant model of this system and compared the sentiment discriminant error of COVID-19 related comments with the Jiagu deep learning model. The results show that our model has better generalization ability and smaller discriminant error. We designed a large data visualization screen, which can clearly show the trend of public emotions, the proportion of various emotion categories, keywords, hot topics, etc., and fully and intuitively reflect the development of public opinion.","Zhang, Yixian; Chen, Jieren; Liu, Boyi; Yang, Yifan; Li, Haocheng; Zheng, Xinyi; Chen, Xi; Ren, Tenglong; Xiong, Naixue","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200523",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Robot art, in the eye of the beholder?: Personalization through self-disclosure facilitates visual communication of emotions in representational art","Socially assistive robots could help to support people's well-being in contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood. For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study, participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy involving""visual metaphors""to balance exogenous and endogenous components, and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in everyday human environments.","Cooney, Martin","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200508",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Centralized and decentralized isolation strategies and their impact on the COVID-19 pandemic dynamics","The infectious diseases are spreading due to human interactions enabled by various social networks. Therefore, when a new pathogen such as SARS-CoV-2 causes an outbreak, the non-pharmaceutical isolation strategies (e.g., social distancing) are the only possible response to disrupt its spreading. To this end, we introduce the new epidemic model (SICARS) and compare the centralized (C), decentralized (D), and combined (C+D) social distancing strategies, and analyze their efficiency to control the dynamics of COVID-19 on heterogeneous complex networks. Our analysis shows that the centralized social distancing is necessary to minimize the pandemic spreading. The decentralized strategy is insufficient when used alone, but offers the best results when combined with the centralized one. Indeed, the (C+D) is the most efficient isolation strategy at mitigating the network superspreaders and reducing the highest node degrees to less than 10% of their initial values. Our results also indicate that stronger social distancing, e.g., cutting 75% of social ties, can reduce the outbreak by 75% for the C isolation, by 33% for the D isolation, and by 87% for the (C+D) isolation strategy. Finally, we study the impact of proactive versus reactive isolation strategies, as well as their delayed enforcement. We find that the reactive response to the pandemic is less efficient, and delaying the adoption of isolation measures by over one month (since the outbreak onset in a region) can have alarming effects; thus, our study contributes to an understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic both in space and time. We believe our investigations have a high social relevance as they provide insights into understanding how different degrees of social distancing can reduce the peak infection ratio substantially; this can make the COVID-19 pandemic easier to understand and control over an extended period of time.","Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200408",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Visualising COVID-19 Research","The world has seen in 2020 an unprecedented global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, a new strain of coronavirus, causing the COVID-19 pandemic, and radically changing our lives and work conditions. Many scientists are working tirelessly to find a treatment and a possible vaccine. Furthermore, governments, scientific institutions and companies are acting quickly to make resources available, including funds and the opening of large-volume data repositories, to accelerate innovation and discovery aimed at solving this pandemic. In this paper, we develop a novel automated theme-based visualisation method, combining advanced data modelling of large corpora, information mapping and trend analysis, to provide a top-down and bottom-up browsing and search interface for quick discovery of topics and research resources. We apply this method on two recently released publications datasets (Dimensions' COVID-19 dataset and the Allen Institute for AI's CORD-19). The results reveal intriguing information including increased efforts in topics such as social distancing; cross-domain initiatives (e.g. mental health and education); evolving research in medical topics; and the unfolding trajectory of the virus in different territories through publications. The results also demonstrate the need to quickly and automatically enable search and browsing of large corpora. We believe our methodology will improve future large volume visualisation and discovery systems but also hope our visualisation interfaces will currently aid scientists, researchers, and the general public to tackle the numerous issues in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bras, Pierre Le; Gharavi, Azimeh; Robb, David A.; Vidal, Ana F.; Padilla, Stefano; Chantler, Mike J.","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200513",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Universal Masking is Urgent in the COVID-19 Pandemic: SEIR and Agent Based Models, Empirical Validation, Policy Recommendations","We present two models for the COVID-19 pandemic predicting the impact of universal face mask wearing upon the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus--one employing a stochastic dynamic network based compartmental SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered) approach, and the other employing individual ABM (agent-based modelling) Monte Carlo simulation--indicating (1) significant impact under (near) universal masking when at least 80% of a population is wearing masks, versus minimal impact when only 50% or less of the population is wearing masks, and (2) significant impact when universal masking is adopted early, by Day 50 of a regional outbreak, versus minimal impact when universal masking is adopted late. These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Our theoretical and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking. As governments plan how to exit societal lockdowns, it is emerging as a key NPI; a""mouth-and-nose lockdown""is far more sustainable than a""full body lockdown"", on economic, social, and mental health axes.

"Phylogenetic analyses of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 reflected the several routes of introduction to Taiwan, the United States, and Japan","Worldwide Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is disrupting in the economy and anxiety of people. The public anxiety has increased the psychological burden on government and healthcare professionals, resulting in a government worker suicide in Japan. The terrified people are asking the government for border measures. However, are border measures possible for this virus? By analyzing 48 almost complete virus genome sequences, we found out that the viruses that invaded Taiwan, the United States, and Japan were introduced independently. We identified thirteen parsimony-informative sites and three groups (CTC, TCC, and TCT). Viruses found outside China did not form a monophyletic clade, opposite to previous study. These results suggest the difficulty of implementing effective border measures against this virus.","Matsuda, Tomoko; Suzuki, Hikoyu; Ogata, Norichika","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200220",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Inf-Net: Automatic COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation from CT Images","Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread globally in early 2020, causing the world to face an existential health crisis. Automated detection of lung infections from computed tomography (CT) images offers a great potential to augment the traditional healthcare strategy for tackling COVID-19. However, segmenting infected regions from CT slices faces several challenges, including high variation in infection characteristics, and low intensity contrast between infections and normal tissues. Further, collecting a large amount of data is impractical within a short time period, inhibiting the training of a deep model. To address these challenges, a novel COVID-19 Lung Infection Segmentation Deep Network (Inf-Net) is proposed to automatically identify infected regions from chest CT slices. In our Inf-Net, a parallel partial decoder is used to aggregate the high-level features and generate a global map. Then, the implicit reverse attention and explicit edge-attention are utilized to model the boundaries and enhance the representations. Moreover, to alleviate the shortage of labeled data, we present a semi-supervised segmentation framework based on a randomly selected propagation strategy, which only requires a few labeled images and leverages primarily unlabeled data. Our semi-supervised framework can improve the learning ability and achieve a higher performance. Extensive experiments on our COVID-SemiSeg and real CT volumes demonstrate that the proposed Inf-Net outperforms most cutting-edge segmentation models and advances the state-of-the-art performance.","Fan, Deng-Ping; Zhou, Tao; Ji, Ge-Peng; Zhou, Yi; Chen, Geng; Fu, Huazhu; Shen, Jianbing; Shao, Ling","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200422",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Detection and Estimation of Local Signals","We study the maximum score statistic to detect and estimate local signals in the form of change-points in the level, slope, or other property of a sequence of observations, and to segment the sequence when there appear to be multiple changes. We find that when observations are serially dependent, the change-points can lead to upwardly biased estimates of autocorrelations, resulting in a sometimes serious loss of power. Examples involving temperature variations, the level of atmospheric greenhouse gases, suicide rates and daily incidence of COVID-19 illustrate the general theory.","Fang, Xiao; Siegmund, David","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200417",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Symptom extraction from the narratives of personal experiences with COVID-19 on Reddit","Social media discussion of COVID-19 provides a rich source of information into how the virus affects people's lives that is qualitatively different from traditional public health datasets. In particular, when individuals self-report their experiences over the course of the virus on social media, it can allow for identification of the emotions each stage of symptoms engenders in the patient. Posts to the Reddit forum r/COVID19Positive contain first-hand accounts from COVID-19 positive patients, giving insight into personal struggles with the virus. These posts often feature a temporal structure indicating the number of days after developing symptoms the text refers to. Using topic modelling and sentiment analysis, we quantify the change in discussion of COVID-19 throughout individuals' experiences for the first 14 days since symptom onset. Discourse on early symptoms such as fever, cough, and sore throat was concentrated towards the beginning of the posts, while language indicating breathing issues peaked around ten days. Some conversation around critical cases was also identified and appeared at a roughly constant rate. We identified two clear clusters of positive and negative emotions associated with the evolution of these symptoms and mapped their relationships. Our results provide a perspective on the patient experience of COVID-19 that complements other medical data streams and can potentially reveal when mental health issues might appear.","Murray, Curtis; Mitchell, Lewis; Tuke, Jonathan; Mackay, Mark","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200521",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Women worry about family, men about the economy: Gender differences in emotional responses to COVID-19","Among the critical challenges around the COVID-19 pandemic is dealing with potentially detrimental effects on people's mental health. Designing appropriate interventions and identifying the concerns of those most at risk requires methods that can extract worries, concerns and emotional responses from text data. We examine gender differences and the effect of document length on worries about the ongoing COVID-19 situation. Our findings suggest that i) shorter texts do not offer an as adequate insight into psychological processes as longer texts. We further find ii) marked gender differences in topics concerning emotional responses. Women worried more about their loved ones and severe health concerns while men were more occupied with effects on the economy and society. The findings align with general gender differences in language found elsewhere, but the current unique circumstances likely amplified these effects. We close this paper with a call for more high-quality datasets due to the limitations of Tweet-sized data.","Vegt, Isabelle van der; Kleinberg, Bennett","https://www.doi.org/nan","20200417",NA,"ArXiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Le fait que le danger de mort et l’obligation d’enfermer les résidents viennent de l’extérieur, et le maniement permanent des mesures de protection physique ne suppriment pas le sentiment d’inutilité et l’angoisse de mort qu’ils tolèrent ou évitent d’ordinaire.

Summary The responses of nursing homes to the present pandemic and lock-down reveal and amplify the usual defensive mechanisms deployed by professional caregivers against depression. The danger of death and the need to confine the residents, both coming from the outside world, and the permanent management of physical protective measures do not remove the feeling of uselessness and the anxiety of death that the nursing staff habitually tolerates or avoids. On the contrary, these aspects add to caregivers’ need to talk and be listened to.","Charazac, P.

"COVID-19 leads to jump in people seeking MH help in NYC","It's a stressful time to be a New Yorker. People are stuck at home, worrying about their health, their family and their paycheck, Spectrum News New York 1 reported April 13. “We are seeing a lot of calls related to anxiety and stress that people are experiencing today,” said Matt Kudish, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New York City. The organization says the number of callers seeking help has jumped 60% over the last few weeks, and that conversations now last about 15 minutes longer than average. The city says it's also seeing an increase in demand. Web sessions to its NYC Well service jumped 185% last month to more than 81,000. “We're hearing from people who are worried about their own physical health, they're worried about their mental health being forced to stay socially distant from other people,” Kudish said. Health care providers predict that even when the COVID-19 crisis ends, the mental health crisis will continue. They say people will continue to be anxious — this time about leaving home and being convinced it's safe to be outside.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32328","20200417",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Psychological Intervention and COVID-19: What We Know So Far and What We Can Do","The coronavirus COVID-19 and the global pandemic has already had a substantial disruptive impact on society, posing major challenges to the provision of mental health services in a time of crisis, and carrying the spectre of an increased burden to mental health, both in terms of existing psychiatric disorder, and emerging psychological distress from the pandemic. In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.","Inchausti, Felix; MacBeth, Angus; Hasson-Ohayon, Ilanit; Dimaggio, Giancarlo","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10879-020-09460-w","20200527",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

At the time of this writing for the current issue of Management Report, the United States has the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the world, the death toll is climbing, and experts say the situation will get worse before it gets better. Commerce in large areas of the country, including California and the Northeast, has largely shut down. The U.S. secretary of the treasury recently suggested that the U.S. unemployment rate could reach as high as 20 percent. Some economists have said it could go as high as during the economic devastation of the Great Depression, when the unemployment rate peaked at nearly 25 percent in 1933. Other economists have said it may reach 30 percent.

In the wake of the massively volatile global situation created by COVID-19, it is vital to recognize that the trauma it causes can affect people in different ways, at the individual and collective levels, resulting in mental health challenges for many. Although mental health problems account for about one-third of the world’s disability among adults, these issues tend to be under-addressed and overlooked in society and are closely associated with deadly disease outbreaks. In large scale outbreaks, the mental health problems experienced are not limited to infected persons but also extend to involve frontline health workers and community members alike. While it is crucial to limit the spread of infections during an outbreak, previous experience suggests that mental and behavioural health interventions should be fully included in public health response strategies.","Otu, Akaninyene; Charles, Carlo Handy; Yaya, Sanni","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13033-020-00371-w","20200528",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The putative etiology and prevention of autism","Since the initial psychological report by Leo Kanner in 1943, relatively little formal biochemical/neurological research on the cause of autism, other than peripheral searches for genomic mutations, had been carried until the end of the 20th century. As a result of studies on twin sets and the conclusion that autism was largely a hereditary defect, numerous investigations have sought various genetic faults in particular. However, such studies were able to reveal a plausible etiology for this malady in only a small percentage of instances. Key bio-molecular characteristics of this syndrome have been uncovered when the potential roles of the glia were studied in depth. Findings related to biochemical deficiencies appearing early in the newborn, such as depressed IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor #1) in neurogenesis/myelination, are becoming emphasized in many laboratories. Progress leading to timely diagnoses and subsequent prevention of central nervous system dysconnectivity now seems plausible. The tendency for an infant to develop autism may currently be determinable and preventable before irreversible psychosocial disturbances become established. These discussions about glial function will be inter-spersed with comments about their apparent relevance to autism. The concluding portion of this presentation will be a detailed review and summation of this diagnosis and prevention proposition.","Steinman, Gary","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/bs.pmbts.2020.04.013","20200510",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"North Carolina frees up $30 million for BH during COVID-19 crisis","North Carolina's seven regional managed care agencies for behavioral health are receiving $30 million so they can keep a variety of programs running during the COVID-19 crisis, Carolina Public Press reported March 31. The money, which an N.C. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) spokesperson said represented unused Medicaid funds, has been shifted to the state's seven local management entities/managed care organizations, commonly called LME/MCOs. The LME/MCOs manage care for beneficiaries receiving mental health, developmental disabilities and substance abuse services who are on Medicaid, uninsured or underinsured. The letter also gave the LME/MCOs authority to use up to 15% of risk reserves to support contracted providers, but with a significant qualifier. The agencies, the DHHS said, would be able to use their reserves to support providers that are “maintaining consumers in their existing residential placements, utilizing telehealth capabilities to the maximum extent possible, providing services that keep consumers from needing access to emergency departments and inpatient services, and otherwise making efforts to deliver high-quality services during this crisis.” The department's caveat that local providers make every effort to keep their clients out of hospitals is part of a concerted campaign to maintain as much bed space and equipment as possible as the number of COVID-19 cases rises.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32310","20200403",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological influence of Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the general public, medical workers and patients with mental disorders and its countermeasures","Coronovirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) first broke out in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in 2019, and now it spreads in more than 100 countries around the world. On January 30th, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a public health emergency (PHEIC) of international concern. It was classified as a pandemic by (WHO) of the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. With the increase in the number of cases reported by various countries every day, the COVID-19 pandemic has attracted more and more attention around the world. At the same time, this public health emergency has caused a variety of psychological problems, such as panic disorder, anxiety and depression. In addition, the Wuhan Mental Health Center's analysis of 2144 calls from the psychological hotline from February 4 to February 20, 2020 showed that general public accounted for 70%, medical workers accounted for 2.2%, patients with mental disorders accounted for 19.5%, and other personnel accounted for 8.3% (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/kmff1vnaLsT2d9xQkK5pwg).

"PEER COMPANIONSHIP FOR MENTAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS IN PRIMARY CARE: A PRAGMATIC, NON-BLINDED, PARALLEL-GROUP, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL","OBJECTIVES: To determine whether peer companionship delivered by an aging services agency to socially-disconnected older adult primary care patients was associated with improvement in suicidal ideation depression, anxiety, and psychological connectedness. DESIGN: Pragmatic, non-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial comparing peer companionship, The Senior Connection (TSC), to care-as-usual (CAU). SETTING: Lifespan, a non-medical, community-based aging services agency. PARTICIPANTS: Adult primary care patients ages =60 years who endorsed feelings of loneliness or being a burden on others. INTERVENTION: TSC was delivered by Lifespan volunteers who provided supportive visits and phone calls in the subjects’ homes. CAU involved no peer companion assignment. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome was suicidal ideation assessed by the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale; secondary outcomes were depression, anxiety, and feelings of belonging and being a burden on others. Data were collected at baseline, 3-, 6-, and 12-months. RESULTS: Subjects (55% female) had a mean age of 71 years. There was no difference between groups in change in suicidal ideation or belonging. Subjects randomized to TSC had greater reduction in depression (PHQ-9; 2.33 point reduction for TSC vs. 1.32 for CAU, p=0.05), anxiety (GAD-7; TSC 1.52 vs. CAU 0.28, p=0.03), and perceived burden on others (INQ; 0.46 TSC vs. 0.09 CAU, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: TSC was superior to CAU for improving depression, anxiety, and perceived burden, but not suicidal ideation. Although effect sizes were small, the low-cost and nationwide availability of peer companionship justify further examination of its effectiveness and scalability in improving mental health outcomes of socially disconnected older adults.","Conwell, Yeates; Van Orden, Kim; Stone, Deborah M.; McIntosh, Wendy LiKamWa; Messing, Susan; Rowe, Jody; Podgorski, Carol; Kaukeinen, Kimberly A.; Tu, Xin","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.021","20200602",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Flattening the mental ill-health curve: the importance of primary prevention in managing the mental health impacts of COVID19","The COVID19 pandemic is one the biggest challenges the global community has faced. The threat of the virus coupled with the impacts of the social and economic shut-down measures required to slow its spread, already appear to be impacting on people's mental health and wellbeing. Over the weeks, months and years ahead it is likely that many countries will experience a ‘wave’ of COVID19 related mental disorders as a result of an increase in risk factors linked to the pandemic such as social isolation; child-maltreatment; intimate partner violence; unemployment; housing and income stress; workplace trauma; and grief and loss. The ‘two-pronged’ approach used to deal with COVID19, provides an excellent blueprint for managing its mental health impacts as well. Nations must focus on preventing the occurrence of new cases of mental disorders as well as strengthening their mental healthcare response to support people who become mentally unwell. A focus on primary prevention is particularly important to ‘flatten the curve’ and avoid a surge in incidence of mental disorders stemming from the COVID19 pandemic. Many evidence-based interventions designed to prevent common disorders are already available and should be scaled-up. These interventions include parenting programs, social and emotional learning programs, self-care strategies, and workplace mental wellbeing programs, among others.","Carbone, Stephen R.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.mhp.2020.200185","20200515",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Diferencias en función de la edad y la autopercepción del envejecimiento en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y sintomatología comórbida ansioso-depresiva durante el confinamiento por el COVID-19","Resumen Objetivos: Analizar si existen diferencias en función de la edad en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en personas jóvenes, de mediana edad y mayores confinadas debido a la pandemia del COVID-19, y explorar la relación entre la autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento y nivel de sintomatología psicológica en función del grupo de edad. Método: Participan 1501 personas (rango de edad: 18 a 88 años). Se evaluó el grado de ansiedad, tristeza y soledad, y autopercepción del envejecimiento. Se dividió a la muestra en función del grupo de edad y por cuartiles (bajo, intermedios y alto) en ansiedad, tristeza, soledad y autopercepción del envejecimiento. Resultados: Las personas mayores informan de menor ansiedad y tristeza que los de mediana edad y jóvenes, y los de mediana edad de menores niveles que los jóvenes. Los de mediana edad informan de menor soledad, seguidos de los mayores y los jóvenes. Para cada grupo de edad, aquellos con una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento informan de mayor ansiedad, tristeza y soledad. Hay más comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva en jóvenes y menos en mayores; más personas deprimidas en mediana edad, menos mayores con ansiedad, y más mayores y menos jóvenes sin sintomatología ansiosa y depresiva. Para todos los grupos de edad, las personas con comorbilidad ansioso-depresiva son las que tienen puntuaciones altas en autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento. Conclusiones: Las personas mayores informan de menos malestar psicológico que otros grupos de edad. Tener una alta autopercepción negativa del envejecimiento perjudica a la salud psicológica independientemente de la edad.

Method: Participants are 1501 people (age range 18 to 88 years). Anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging were assessed. The sample was divided according to the age group and quartiles (lower, intermediate levels, and higher) of anxiety, sadness, loneliness and self-perceptions of aging. Results: Older adults reported lower levels of anxiety and sadness than middle aged adults, and middle aged adults reported lower levels than younger participants. Middle aged adults reported the lowest loneliness, followed by older adults and younger participants. For each age group, those with more negative self-perceptions of aging reported higher anxiety, sadness and loneliness. More comorbid anxiety and sadness was found in younger adults and less in older adults; more depressed participants in the middle aged group, and more older adults and less younger participants were found in the group with the lowest levels of anxiety and sadness. For all the age groups, participants with high levels of comorbid anxiety and sadness are those who report the highest scores in negative self-perceptions of aging. Conclusions: Older adults reported lower psychological anxiety, sadness and loneliness than the other age groups. Having negative self-perceptions of aging damage psychological health irrespective of the chronological age.","Losada-Baltar, Andrés; Márquez-González, María; Jiménez-Gonzalo, Lucía; Pedroso-Chaparro, María del Sequeros; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Fernandes-Pires, José","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.regg.2020.05.005","20200604",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Factors Associated with Depression, Anxiety, and PTSD Symptomatology During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Clinical Implications for US Young Adult Mental Health","This study sought to identify factors associated with depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptomatology in U.S. young adults (18-30 years) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional online study assessed 898 participants from April 13, 2020 to May 19, 2020, approximately one month after the U.S. declared a state of emergency due to COVID-19 and prior to the initial lifting of restrictions across 50 U.S. states. Respondents reported high levels of depression (43.3%, PHQ-8 scores = 10), high anxiety scores (45.4%, GAD-7 scores = 10), and high levels of PTSD symptoms (31.8%, PCL-C scores = 45). High levels of loneliness, high levels of COVID-19-specific worries, and low distress tolerance were significantly associated with clinical levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD symptoms. Resilience was associated with low levels of depression and anxiety symptoms but not PTSD. Most respondents had high levels of social support; social support from family, but not from partner or peers, was associated with low levels of depression and PTSD. Compared to Whites, Asian Americans were less likely to report high levels across mental health symptoms, and Hispanic/Latinos were less likely to report high levels of anxiety. These factors provide initial guidance regarding clinical management for COVID-19-related mental health problems.","Liu, Cindy H.; Zhang, Emily; Wong, Ga Tin Fifi; Hyun, Sunah; Hahm, Hyeouk “Chris”","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113172","20200601",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Briefly Noted","By the time this issue of ADAW is published, the final figures will be out. At press time, some $400 million in a $2 trillion stimulus package designed to combat economic problems from the coronavirus pandemic is going to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, according to Andrew Kessler, principal with Slingshot Solutions. Both the Senate and House versions allocated $400 million. The Senate bill proposed $425 million, while the House proposed $435 million. In both bills, $15 million goes to the Indian Health Service and $50 million to suicide prevention. In the Senate bill, $250 million is allocated to certified community behavioral health clinics (CCBHCs), while that number is $200 million in the House version. These clinics currently exist in only eight states, Kessler pointed out. The CCBHC money will allow states to apply for grants and put forth their own behavioral health priorities, said Kessler.

"Command Suicidal Hallucination as Initial Presentation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19): A Case Report","INTRODUCTION: Presently the COVID-19 pandemic is raging through the United States and worldwide. This enigmatic virus characteristically affects the respiratory system. Atypical presentations, such as gastrointestinal symptoms, and cases of encephalopathy have also been reported. However, psychiatric symptoms as the initial presenting feature is novel. We describe one such case. CASE PRESENTATION: 53-year-old man with no prior psychiatric or significant medical history was brought to the emergency department after ingesting bleach in an apparent suicide attempt. On initial presentation, the patient was uncooperative and withdrawn, though alert and oriented. He subsequently developed fever, tachycardia, elevated blood urea nitrogen and transaminases. SARS CoV-2 was confirmed on RT-PCR. Neurological examination was non-contributory. As his clinical condition improved, the patient reported that his initial symptom was an auditory hallucination telling him to jump from a bridge or ingest bleach. He reported that the increasing intensity of his auditory hallucinations led him to act upon it. He denied mood symptoms or suicidal ideation. The hallucinations did not recur during the hospital course, but he required 3 doses of antipsychotic medication for agitation. After improvement of his SARS CoV-2 infection, he was free of psychiatric symptoms and was discharged to a subacute rehabilitation center. CONCLUSION: This case indicates that what appears as a sudden onset of a psychiatric illness in the current context may be an initial manifestation of a developing COVID illness.","Mirza, Junaid; Ganguly, Amvrine; Ostrovskaya, Alla; Tusher, Alan; Viswanathan, Ramaswamy","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.022","20200530",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental health of family, friends, and co-workers of COVID-19 patients in Japan","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic rages on, the mental health of both the infected and non-infected is a rising concern. We used administrative survey data (16402 responses in the last two weeks) using a chatbot on LINE, the most popular social networking service (SNS) in Japan, to show that people with COVID-19 patients in a close setting had higher psychological distress level than those without. We believe that the results indicate an urgent need to prioritize the establishment and implementation of mental health and psychosocial support tailored to family, close relatives, and friends of COVID-19 patients.","Tanoue, Yuta; Nomura, Shuhei; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Kawashima, Takayuki; Eguchi, Akifumi; Shi, Shoi; Harada, Nahoko; Miyata, Hiroaki","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113067","20200506",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Grinding of alumina ceramic with microtextured brazed diamond end grinding wheels","Brazed monolayer diamond grinding wheels have advantages of a high abrasive bonding strength, high protrusion, and a large chip disposal space. However, it is difficult to prepare ordered and fine-grained brazed diamond grinding wheels. This study presents a new method for grain-arranged, brazed diamond grinding wheels with microtextures with similar performance to ordered and fine-grained brazed diamond grinding wheels. First, coarse diamond grains (18/20 mesh) were orderly brazed to fabricate the end grinding wheels. Next, a series of microtextures were ablated on the diamond grains using a pulsed laser, and two types of textured end grinding wheels—TG-G (ablated microgrooves only) and TG-GH (ablated microgrooves and microholes)—were prepared. Then, an experiment involving the grinding of alumina ceramics was performed, and the grinding characteristics and grinding mechanism were analyzed. The results indicated that compared with untextured diamond end grinding wheels (TG), the textured diamond grinding wheels (TG-G and TG-GH) significantly reduced the grinding force and the roughness of the machined surface. The local stress concentration at the microtextures promoted the formation of microcracks in the diamond grains of TG-G and TG-GH, and the self-sharpness of the grinding wheel was significantly improved. The brittle fracture mode of ceramic materials in grinding included intergranular fracture and transgranular fracture. Ironing pressure action was a key material-removal mechanism. It had an important influence on the cutting force and plasticity characteristics of the TG machined surface. For the surfaces processed by TG-G and TG-GH, the effect of ironing was weakened, while shearing played a more important role. The TG-GH grinding wheel ablated with microgrooves and microholes was superior to the TG-G grinding wheel ablated with only microgrooves, with regard to the grinding force, roughness, and self-sharpening.","Wu, Shixiong; Zhang, Fenglin; Ni, Yongqian; Chen, Feng; Yan, Zhiqiao","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ceramint.2020.05.009","20200525",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"COVID-19 Related Loneliness and Psychiatric Symptoms among Older Adults: The Buffering Role of Subjective Age","OBJECTIVES: The study examined whether subjective age moderated the relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms. METHODS: A convenience sample of older adult Israelis (N=277, mean age=69.58±6.72) completed web-based questionnaires comprising loneliness, anxiety, depressive and peritraumatic distress symptoms. They also reported how old they felt. RESULTS: The positive relationship between loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic and psychiatric symptoms was weak among those who felt younger than their age while this very same relationship was robust among those feeling older. CONCLUSIONS: Young subjective age may weaken the loneliness-symptom association among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Older adults holding an older age identity are more susceptible to the adverse effects of loneliness. Although preliminary, the findings may inform screening and interventions. Subjective age may help identify those at high risk in suffering from loneliness, and suggest interventions aimed at ameliorating both loneliness and older subjective ages.","Shrira, Amit; Hoffman, Yaakov; Bodner, Ehud; Palgi, Yuval","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jagp.2020.05.018","20200527",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"What does social distancing mean for patients in forensic mental health settings?","Governments across the globe have called for social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Secure settings will not be able to comply with these strictly, nor will they have the same recourse to the novel and creative solutions the general population does. Activities have been restricted in quality, quantity and scope; transfers and discharges have been halted and patient progress put on pause. Understanding how and what ways these restrictions will affect patients is crucial. This is especially salient given that large numbers of the general population have reported heightened mental health burden in recent surveys. However, it is not yet clear how and in what ways the COVID-19 restrictions will affect the mental health of patients in secure care. Past research investigating patients experiences of restrictions on autonomy in secure care that were present before the pandemic can be helpful here. Studies suggest that patient experience restrictions in care in myriad subjective ways. These include limitations on family contact, outside leave, and making hot drinks but also more profoundly on their autonomy, sense of self, and personhood. Quantitative studies have found correlations between experiences of restrictiveness and ward atmosphere, quality of life, suicidal ideation, depression and general psychological state in this patient group. This paper suggests how we can use past research exploring patient expereinces of restrictive interventions to guide the implementation of social distancing measures in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tomlin, Dr Jack","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsiml.2020.100018","20200428",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Massachusetts coalition launches campaign to preserve bed access","A coalition of registered nurses with the Massachusetts Nurses Association (MNA), along with patients, families, advocates and elected officials who have been fighting for the preservation of mental health beds across Western Massachusetts, has launched a new campaign, “Mental Health is Public Health,” to save essential inpatient psychiatric services, according to a March 16 news release. The effort comes as Trinity Health plans to close 74 pediatric and adult psychiatric beds at Providence Behavioral Health Hospital in Holyoke; Baystate Health seeks the closure of all its mental health beds in Greenfield, Palmer and Westfield; and COVID-19 places additional pressure on already-strained emergency departments and other hospital services throughout the region. “These proposed closures would devastate an already-strained mental health system,” said Cindy Chaplin, RN at Providence and co-chair of the MNA Bargaining Committee. “Right now, we need to maximize capacity in emergency departments and other hospital units, not decrease services. When everyone else in Massachusetts agrees we should be making it easier for patients to get high-quality mental healthcare, Trinity Health is going in the opposite direction.”","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32287","20200320",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"“Quarantine during COVID-19 outbreak: changes in Diet and physical activity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease”","Abstract Aims CoV-19/SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of infection, several Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. The present commentary briefly analyzes the effects of quarantine on lifestyle, including nutrition and physical activity and the impact of new technologies in dealing with this situation. Data Synthesis Quarantine is associated with stress and depression leading to unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity. A diet poor in fruit and vegetables is frequent during isolation, with a consequent low intake of antioxidants and vitamins. However, vitamins have recently been identified as a principal weapon in the fight against the Cov-19 virus. Some reports suggest that Vitamin D could exert a protective effect on such infection. During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to encourage adherence to a healthy diet should be implemented. The WHO has just released guidance for people in self-quarantine, those without any symptoms or diagnosis of acute respiratory illness, which provides practical advice on how to stay active and reduce sedentary behaviour while at home. Conclusions Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine, a global action supporting healthy Diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to a good lifestyle routine.","Mattioli, Anna Vittoria; Sciomer, Susanna; Cocchi, Camilla; Maffei, Silvia; Gallina, Sabina","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.numecd.2020.05.020","20200530",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"International tracking of the COVID-19 invasion: an amazing example of a globalized scientific coordination effort","It is extraordinary to witness the spread of COVID-19 almost in real-time. This tight monitoring of the invasion of a new virus is a situation that most other invasion scientists could only dream of. Especially spatiotemporal spread data of the early phases of an invasion would be extremely useful in order to understand and predict the human-mediated spread of species around the globe. So far, invasive species that directly affect human health, such as the Sars-Cov-2 virus causing COVID-19, have been treated differently from invasive species affecting environmental health. Despite progresses in constructing large checklists of invasive species, these records often enter the databases only decades after the establishment of the organism in a country. This is inadequate to understand ongoing spread dynamics and estimate current invasion risks. Yet, national services often possess extremely useful information about early detections and interceptions of species at air and maritime ports, which could greatly improve predictions and help set management priorities. Considering the massive impacts of invasive species, it is time to move on to such a collaborative way of handling invasion data. Invasive insects, birds, mammals, fungi, and other species are the result of globalization and call for a globalized response, exactly like the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bertelsmeier, Cleo; Ollier, Sébastien","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s10530-020-02287-5","20200519",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Maintaining high quality multidisciplinary pain medicine fellowship programs: Part I: Innovations in pain fellows’ education, research, applicant selection process, wellness and ACGME implementation during the Covid-19 pandemic","BACKGROUND: Pain fellowship programs are facing unique challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Restrictions from state governments and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have resulted in a rapidly changing and evolving learning environment for todays’ fellows. Innovative solutions must be sought to guarantee proper education is maintained and ensure the well-being of our trainees. METHODS: We assembled a panel of pain program directors who serve as officers/board members of the Association of Pain Program Directors to provide guidance and formulate recommendations to pain fellowship directors nationally. This guidance is based on reviewing current changes to Accreditation Council Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and American Board Anesthesiology policies and best available evidence and expert opinion on use of remote educational activities, research endeavors, and trainee wellness. CONCLUSIONS: The country is in the midst of an unprecedented pandemic. The impact on pain management fellowships has been severe and will likely last for months, resulting in extraordinary challenges to the administration of pain fellowship programs and the education of our fellows. Understanding revisions in ACGME policies, use of technology to promote remote learning opportunities, and providing trainees with opportunities to alleviate their anxieties and encourage mental health are beneficial strategies to implement. Together, we can implement innovative solutions to help overcome these challenges.","Kohan, Lynn; Moeschler, Susan; Spektor, Boris; Przkora, Rene; Sobey, Cristopher; Brancolini, Scott; Wahezi, Sayed; Anitescu, Magdalena","https://www.doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnaa168","20200429",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

This case study examines an education and environment program which has adapted to the social distancing measures of COVID-19, resulting in an even more community-reliant and community-driven program than the program designers initially intended. The Eco Ambassador Program uses environmental activism within a space that supports mental health during COVID-19 social isolation. While community engagement and action have been elements of the program, the program has transformed to utilize new levels of social capital in the program’s network, to overcome the obstacles presented in regular programming. Many aspects of the critical pedagogy of space are utilized to conceptualize this educational program during the pandemic. The limitations of in-person interactions in defined learning spaces led to more technology-reliant programming, hence broadening the space of place-based learning, while enabling personal spaces and personal environments to become new learning spaces.","Iyengar, Radhika; Shin, Haein","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11125-020-09467-0","20200529",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychosocial impact of COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Along with its high infectivity and fatality rates, the 2019 Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) has caused universal psychosocial impact by causing mass hysteria, economic burden and financial losses. Mass fear of COVID-19, termed as “coronaphobia”, has generated a plethora of psychiatric manifestations across the different strata of the society. So, this review has been undertaken to define psychosocial impact of COVID-19. METHODS: Pubmed and GoogleScholar are searched with the following key terms- “COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV2”, “Pandemic”, “Psychology”, “Psychosocial”, “Psychitry”, “marginalized”, “telemedicine”, “mental health”, “quarantine”, “infodemic”, “social media” and” “internet”. Few news paper reports related to COVID-19 and psychosocial impacts have also been added as per context. RESULTS: Disease itself multitude by forced quarantine to combat COVID-19 applied by nationwide lockdowns can produce acute panic, anxiety, obsessive behaviors, hoarding, paranoia, and depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the long run. These have been fueled by an “infodemic” spread via different platforms social media. Outbursts of racism, stigmatization, and xenophobia against particular communities are also being widely reported. Nevertheless, frontline healthcare workers are at higher-risk of contracting the disease as well as experiencing adverse psychological outcomes in form of burnout, anxiety, fear of transmitting infection, feeling of incompatibility, depression, increased substance-dependence, and PTSD. Community-based mitigation programs to combat COVID-19 will disrupt children's usual lifestyle and may cause florid mental distress. The psychosocial aspects of older people, their caregivers, psychiatric patients and marginalized communities are affected by this pandemic in different ways and need special attention. CONCLUSION: For better dealing with these psychosocial issues of different strata of the society, psychosocial crisis prevention and intervention models should be urgently developed by the government, health care personnel and other stakeholders. Apt application of internet services, technology and social media to curb both pandemic and infodemic needs to be instigated. Psychosocial preparedness by setting up mental organizations specific for future pandemics is certainly necessary.","Dubey, Souvik; Biswas, Payel; Ghosh, Ritwik; Chatterjee, Subhankar; Dubey, Mahua Jana; Chatterjee, Subham; Lahiri, Durjoy; Lavie, Carl J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.dsx.2020.05.035","20200527",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"A blended cognitive behavioral intervention for patients with adjustment disorder with anxiety: A randomized controlled trial","Adjustment disorder with anxiety (ADA) is a common psychiatric pathology worldwide, but it is often undertreated. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first-line treatment, but very few studies have been carried out for the treatment of ADA. Internet-delivered CBT (iCBT) appears to be an effective treatment option, with the potential to reach a larger proportion of individuals suffering from ADA. Guidance is a beneficial feature of iCBT, provided in most studies by email or telephone (traditional guided iCBT). Blended CBT, which combines an online intervention and therapeutic guidance provided in person (face-to-face), could be a way to benefit from both the advantages of face-to-face CBT regarding human interactional quality and the advantages of internet-based CBT in terms of improved access to treatment. In this randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of two forms of administration of Seren@ctif, a 5-week CBT program for patients with ADA according the DSM-5, was examined: one delivered through face-to-face sessions (face-to-face CBT) and the other delivered online and guided with face-to-face contact with a nurse (blended CBT); these formats were compared with a wait-list control group (WLC). A total of 120 patients were included and randomized to one of these three conditions. Measures were administered before treatment, after treatment and 6 months after inclusion in the study. Both treatment conditions displayed significant decreases in anxiety, depression, worry and perceived stress at posttreatment when compared to the WLC group. The decrease in symptoms was mostly maintained 6 months after inclusion for the two experimental groups. Blended CBT showed significantly greater reductions in anxiety and depression than did face-to-face CBT on some secondary outcome measures. We conclude that both face-to-face CBT and blended CBT are effective treatments for patients with ADA, and we suggest that blended CBT may be slightly more effective than classical face-to-face CBT.

"Isolation of patients in psychiatric hospitals in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic: An ethical, legal, and practical challenge","Psychiatric inpatients are particularly vulnerable to the transmission and effects of COVID-19. As such, healthcare providers should implement measures to prevent its spread within mental health units, including adequate testing, cohorting, and in some cases, the isolation of patients. Respiratory isolation imposes a significant limitation on an individual's right to liberty, and should be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards. This paper explores the implications of respiratory isolation in English law, considering the applicability of the common law doctrine of necessity, the Mental Capacity Act 2005, the Mental Health Act 1983, and public health legislation. We then interrogate the practicality of currently available approaches by applying them to a series of hypothetical cases. There are currently no ‘neat’ or practicable solutions to the problem of lawfully isolating patients on mental health units, and we discuss the myriad issues with both mental health and public health law approaches to the problem.

"Thrive Health: a New Venture Connecting Patient Advocacy to Well-Being","As part of the British Columbia government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, an online self-assessment tool was launched to help with symptom assessment and to provide necessary health information for people. The tool was developed by Thrive Health, a company which has been working to improve the delivery of e-health in Canada since 2016, with an emphasis on well-being. This review captures this company’s purpose and role in addressing the needs of patients and healthcare providers in the community, to change the definition of healthcare. In pursuing this goal, Thrive Health is innovating to make the long lost connection between physical and mental health through an online app with design features supported by research around subjective well-being, as a measurement of effective community development and human progress. This very characteristic is what establishes the company’s uniqueness among other similar patient advocacy groups, and connects patient advocacy to happiness and well-being.","Fassihi, Farina","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s42413-020-00065-8","20200512",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"The educational value of outpatient CL rotations- a white paper from the ACLP residency education subcommittee","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: As mental health services in outpatient medical clinics expand, psychiatrists must be trained to practice in these settings. The Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry (ACLP) residency education subcommittee convened a writing group with the goal of summarizing the current evidence about outpatient consultation-liaison psychiatry (CLP) training and providing a framework for CLP educators who are interested in developing outpatient CLP rotations within their programs. METHOD: MEDLINE (via PubMed), Embase and PsycINFO (via OVID), were reviewed each from inception to December 2019, for psychiatric CLP services in ambulatory settings that involved residents or fellows. The CLP education guidelines were reviewed for recommendations relevant to outpatient CLP. We also searched MedEd portal for published curriculums relevant to CLP. The group held 2 conferences to reach consensus about recommendations in setting up outpatient CLP rotations. RESULTS: Seventeen articles, three ACLP supported guidelines, and eight online didactic resources were identified as directly reporting on the organization and/or impact of an outpatient CLP rotation. These manuscripts indicated that residents found outpatient CLP rotations effective and relevant to their future careers. However, the literature provided few recommendations for establishing formal outpatient CLP training experiences. DISCUSSION: Outpatient CLP rotations offer multiple benefits for trainees, including exposure to specific clinical scenarios and therapeutic interventions applicable only in the outpatient setting, increased continuity of care and the unique experience of providing liaison and education to non-mental health providers. The article outlines recommendations and examples for developing outpatient CLP rotations which CLP educators can incorporate in their programs.","Zimbrean, Paula C.; Ernst, Carrie L.; Forray, Ariadna; Beach, Scott R.; Lavakumar, Mallika; Siegel, Andrew M.; Soeprono, Thomas; Schwartz, Ann C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psym.2020.05.004","20200519",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

The new figures bring the total number of deaths from the virus, now known as COVID-19, to 1,523 globally, and there are 66,492 confirmed cases in the country, according to China's National Health Commission. The outbreak has taxed health care workers, doctors and nurses throughout China, particularly in Wuhan, where it first originated in December 2019. Robots have been deployed in some hospitals to deliver medicines and disinfect surfaces so workers are free to do other tasks. Survivors of the outbreak in China could face a mental health toll after weeks of being quarantined from the rest of the world, which could create anxiety and fear, according to some mental health professionals.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32253","20200221",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Illinois rolls out COVID-19 MH crisis hotline as cases climb","After another deadly 24 hours in Illinois, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced a new program to connect scared and depressed Illinois residents to badly needed mental health services, Block Club Chicago reported April 11. In the 24 hours in question, 81 people died from COVID-19 and 1,293 new confirmed cases were reported. Hoping to help those in need of mental and physical health care during the crisis, the state has created programs that will help people from afar. Call4Calm, a free emotional support text line, was created to serve Illinois residents “swimming in the stress and uncertainty” caused by COVID-19, Pritzker said. To connect with a counselor, people can text “TALK” to 552020 or text “HABLAR” to the same number for counseling in Spanish. Users will remain anonymous, and the state has partnered with mental health organizations to have counselors respond. Once a resident texts the hotline, they'll get a call from a licensed counselor within 24 hours. The program was announced as the state reached 19,180 confirmed COVID-19 cases, said Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32329","20200417",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

The “Strive for Five” campaign aims to educate and encourage New Yorkers to use a variety of strategies, such as phone, text, web, social media, and other applications and Zoom technologies to reach out and offer mental health support to at least five people over the next 30 days. As movement is increasingly restricted, virtual check-ins grow more important each day, advocates stated. “We encourage New Yorkers to connect with people who may be isolated, lonely or live alone, and to reach out to neighbors, friends, families and co-workers. First responders, health care workers and other individuals who are courageously keeping our essential services open also need support now, as do caregivers who are hard at work taking care of others,” said NYAPRS and the coalition.","","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/mhw.32300","20200327",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Human gene and disease associations for clinical-genomics and precision medicine research","We are entering the era of personalized medicine in which an individual's genetic makeup will eventually determine how a doctor can tailor his or her therapy. Therefore, it is becoming critical to understand the genetic basis of common diseases, for example, which genes predispose and rare genetic variants contribute to diseases, and so on. Our study focuses on helping researchers, medical practitioners, and pharmacists in having a broad view of genetic variants that may be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to all available, authentic and actionable genes, SNPs, and classified diseases and drugs collected from different clinical and genomics databases worldwide, including Ensembl, GenCode, ClinVar, GeneCards, DISEASES, HGMD, OMIM, GTR, CNVD, Novoseek, Swiss-Prot, LncRNADisease, Orphanet, GWAS Catalog, SwissVar, COSMIC, WHO, and FDA. We present a new cutting-edge gene-SNP-disease-drug mobile database with a smart phone application, integrating information about classified diseases and related genes, germline and somatic mutations, and drugs. Its database includes over 59 000 protein-coding and noncoding genes; over 67 000 germline SNPs and over a million somatic mutations reported for over 19 000 protein-coding genes located in over 1000 regions, published with over 3000 articles in over 415 journals available at the PUBMED; over 80 000 ICDs; over 123 000 NDCs; and over 100 000 classified gene-SNP-disease associations. We present an application that can provide new insights into the information about genetic basis of human complex diseases and contribute to assimilating genomic with phenotypic data for the availability of gene-based designer drugs, precise targeting of molecular fingerprints for tumor, appropriate drug therapy, predicting individual susceptibility to disease, diagnosis, and treatment of rare illnesses are all a few of the many transformations expected in the decade to come.","Ahmed, Zeeshan; Zeeshan, Saman; Mendhe, Dinesh; Dong, XinQi","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.28","20200503",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

This question may serve to inform whether or not suicides are being accurately reported and documented. Data from all 50 states from the years 2012-2016 were obtained from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS) developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A total of 213,726 suicide fatalities, 702,176 unintentional injury fatalities, and 24,533 undetermined injury fatalities comprised the dataset. Injury fatality rates depicted annual increases in both suicide and unintentional injury fatalities but variability in undetermined injury fatalities. Bivariate analyses discovered a statistically significant association between annual suicide fatality rates and unintentional (nonsuicidal) injury fatality rates. It would be suspected, ceteris paribus, that calculated rate changes over these years would follow suit. However, this was not observed. Given the trends and increasing stigma surrounding suicide, it is worth considering the degree to which suicides may be underreported or -documented and the epidemiological and translational ramifications of these trends as they pertain to future suicide research.","Lenno, Jack C.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113066","20200511",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

The whole experience, organized by a famous contemporary choreographer Angelin Preljocaj, is filmed by Valérie Müller, producing Danser sa peine (To dance her sentence / her sorrow), nominated for an award. The sessions are planned: two hours and a half, 2 times a week, for four months, no technique required. A group of five women starts with ordinary easy functional movements, gaining in innovative and expressive qualities, spatial perceptions, feelings and interpersonal interactions, leaded by A. Preljocaj in a helpful and empathic mood. At the same time, he discovers the cooking authorization in their jail cell. The relevant results shift into a dynamic successful piece Soul Kitchen (2019) performed in town (Dance Festival in Montpellier, south of France) with dancing and cooking occurrences on stage. It makes sense, specially about self-esteem, body image and positive opinion from the audience. The women’s physical and psychological states linked with a long lack of space and sensitivity… move to a better self-balance and feelings of well-being. In a similar state of mind, the French confined population – youth to elderly–try to find different and imaginative strategies at home as moving in a restrictive area, enjoying family cooking… through trainings provided by Internet, looking for reducing anxiety, depressive disorders and other social problems.

"Impact of Covid-19 on training and wellbeing in subspecialty surgery: a national survey of cardiothoracic trainees in the United Kingdom","Structured Abstract Objectives The Covid-19 pandemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems and disrupted routine care internationally. Healthcare workers face disruption to their work routines and professional development, as well as an elevated risk of infection and morbidity. We sought to establish the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the wellbeing, practice and progression of all trainees in cardiothoracic surgery in the United Kingdom. Methods A 31-item questionnaire was designed, validated, and disseminated via email and an instant-messaging platform. Results 76 (of 118, 64%) cardiothoracic surgical trainees responded, representing all training grades and programmes nationally. 48 (63%) and 24 (32%) were concerned about their physical and mental health respectively. 25 (33%) had taken time off work due to Covid-19. 65 (86%) had treated Covid-19 patients, 36 of whom (55%) were wearing satisfactory personal protective equipment at the time. 41 (54%) remain concerned about PPE provision at their institution. 42 (55%) had been redeployed to cover other specialties. 23 (30%) had encountered ethical dilemmas related to care of patients. There was a significant impact on time spent in outpatient clinics (44% reduction), multidisciplinary team meetings (79% reduction) and operating theatres (78% reduction). 67 (88%) of respondents were concerned about the impact on their training, and 54 (71%) felt that the deviation may require an extension in their planned training time.

"COVID-19 anxiety symptoms associated with problematic smartphone use severity in Chinese adults","BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is fast-spreading and potentially fatal, introducing home quarantine, social distancing, and increased internet usage globally. We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use.

"Deliberate release: Plague – A review","Yersinia pestis is the causative agent of plague and is considered one of the most likely pathogens to be used as a bioweapon. In humans, plague is a severe clinical infection that can rapidly progress with a high mortality despite antibiotic therapy. Therefore, early treatment of Y. pestis infection is crucial. This review provides an overview of its clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, prophylaxis, and protection requirements for the use of clinicians. We discuss the likelihood of a deliberate release of plague and the feasibility of obtaining, isolating, culturing, transporting and dispersing plague in the context of an attack aimed at a westernized country. The current threat status and the medical and public health responses are reviewed. We also provide a brief review of the potential prehospital treatment strategy and vaccination against Y. pestis. Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.","Ansari, Issmaeel; Grier, Gareth; Byers, Mark","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jobb.2020.02.001","20200330",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Transplant patient’s isolation and social distancing due to covid-19: analysis of the resilient capacities of the transplant in the management of the coronavirus’ emergency","Introduction One of the peculiar aspects of the transplant patient’s life is that in the post-surgery phase he lives in an “isolation” condition, having to pay particular attention to the living environment and preferring a limited social life given that the immunosuppressive treatment entails immunodepression in the patient. In covid 19, likewise in a post surgery situation, social isolation is being implemented. Material and Methods The study started on March 17th 2020 and ended on April 24rd 2020. Interviews consulting/phone were made. The phone questionnaire, submitted to 71 patients, consisted of a set of 15 questions that investigated the structure and the psychological resistance. 8 patients have been monitored exclusively for the psychological aspect through a more articulate supporting path. Results In essence, from the overall analysis of the data deriving from the study of the positioning of patients based on the stage of renal function and the bands related to the development of psychopathological aspects and the use of positive peronal resources, it emerges that patients in stage V ""Kidney failure ""are in the first bracket as regards the development of psychopathological aspects (absence of these experiences) and in the third bracket as regards the good use of positive resources to deal with isolation. Therefore, it can be deduced that, although with a data that can be expanded, a serious or medium-serious situation from an organic point of view in this socio-health emergency situation is well addressed by the transplanted patient Conclusions Transplant patients have faced the measure of social distancing adequately and in adherence to the treatment, thanks to the phone assistance of all the medical-surgical and psychological team.","Diana, Lupi; Barbara, Binda; Filippo, Montali; Andrea, Natili; Laura, Lancione; Davide, Chiappori; Ida, Parzanese; Daniela, Maccarone; Francesco, Pisani","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.transproceed.2020.05.031","20200530",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Correlates of symptoms of anxiety and depression and mental wellbeing associated with COVID-19: a cross-sectional study of UK-based respondents","Background: The aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing on mental health, and potential correlates, among a sample of the UK population. Methods: A cross-sectional study. Mental health was measured using the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory. Mental wellbeing was measured using The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale. Data collected on predictors included sex, age, marital status, employment, annual income, region, current smoking, current alcohol consumption, physical multimorbidity, any physical symptoms experienced during self-isolation/social distancing, and the number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between potential predictors and poor mental health was studied using a multivariable logistic regression. Results: 932 participants were included. Factors associated with poor mental health were sex (reference: male; female: OR=1.89, 95%CI=1.34-2.68), age (18-24 years: reference;45-54 years: OR=0.27, 95%CI=0.14-0.53; 55-64 years: OR=0.24, 95%CI=0.12-0.47; 65-74years: OR=0.10, 95% CI=0.05-0.22; and =75years: OR=0.08,95% CI=0.03-0.24),annual income (<£15,000: reference; £25,000-<£40,000: OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.31-0.93; £40,000-<£60,000: OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69; and =£60,000: OR=0.38, 95% CI=0.21-0.67), current smoking (yes: OR=2.59, 95%CI=1.62-4.20), and physical multimorbidity (OR=2.35, 95%CI=1.61-3.46). Conclusions: In this sample of UK adults self-isolating/social distancing females, younger age groups, those with a lower annual income, current smokers and those with physical multimorbidity were associated with higher levels of poor mental health.","Smith, Lee; Jacob, Louis; Yakkundi, Anita; McDermott, Daragh; Armstrong, Nicola C; Barnett, Yvonne; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.; Martin, Suzanne; Butler, Laurie; Tully, Mark A","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113138","20200529",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Mental Health and Psychosocial Challenges in the COVID-19 Pandemic: Food for Thought for Cardiovascular Health Care Professionals","Background The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has produced substantial health challenges from the perspective of both its direct health complications and the disruption to delivery of standard care for individuals with a range of acute and chronic health issues. In parallel, the widespread application of social isolation initiatives in most countries raises the potential for significant mental health consequences and psychosocial impacts. This has major implications for cardiovascular health care professionals and the management of their patients. Challenges The COVID-19 pandemic and associated physical isolation practices are likely to result in a range of mental health and psychosocial challenges. In addition to an increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, suicidal ideation and post-traumatic stress, the pandemic may also witness an increase in substance abuse, domestic violence and relationship discord. The consequences of these complications will be further magnified, when considering their potential effect on cardiovascular disease and its management. Purpose This statement aims to summarise some of the potential mental health and psychosocial challenges that may arise in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.","O’Neil, Adriene; Nicholls, Stephen J.; Redfern, Julie; Brown, Alex; Hare, David L.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.hlc.2020.05.002","20200521",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Fear of COVID-19 and Positivity: Mediating Role of Intolerance of Uncertainty, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress","This study aimed to investigate the mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The participants consisted of 960 individuals, including 663 females (69.1%) and 297 males (30.9%). The age of the participants ranged between 18 and 76 (29.74 ± 9.64). As a result of the correlation analysis, a positive relationship was found between fear of COVID-19 and intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress, and a negative relationship was determined between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. The result of the analysis for the study model indicated that there was a mediating role of intolerance of uncertainty, depression, anxiety, and stress in the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and positivity. Eliminating uncertainty from the fear of COVID-19 will contribute to reducing depression, anxiety and stress, and increasing positivity.","Bakioglu, Fuad; Korkmaz, Ozan; Ercan, Hülya","https://www.doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00331-y","20200528",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Challenges faced by mental health providers and patients during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic due to technological barriers","BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been responsible for the devastation of hundreds of thousands of lives directly and has caused disruptions globally. Vulnerable populations, specifically those suffering from serious mental illness and homelessness, are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 infection resulting in medical complications and psychiatric destabilization. In addition, mental health has become increasingly relevant throughout the country given the psychological distress people have been facing due to the spread of COVID-19 and the toll of a more restricted way of living. Although the healthcare industry has quickly integrated novel ways of treating patients with mental illness with technological advances, these technologies are not applicable to different populations equally. There is a clear disparity that is represented within the public county health systems, which leads to a widening gap between those who receive adequate treatment for mental illness and those who do not. AIMS: The aims of this paper were to provide a commentary on the benefits of technology-based psychiatric and psychological interventions based off experience in a public health system and based off a relevant, thorough literature review. In addition, we aim to highlight the importance of accessibility of these interventions for vulnerable populations and provide recommendations for integrating these services expeditiously. METHODS: Literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed and Google Scholar. CONCLUSIONS: Based off data collected from experience in a public health system and literature review, we conclude that although the COVID-19 pandemic has initiated significant innovation to integrate technology for psychiatric care, this innovation is not equally accessible for vulnerable populations suffering from mental health disorders. Within a public county health system, there are barriers with providing mental healthcare to vulnerable populations. These barriers, which are applicable throughout the United States, serve as a rationale for the need of innovative solutions for the integration of these services in not only emergency situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but also in daily non-emergent operations to sufficiently address the needs for those needing mental healthcare.","Ojha, Rashi; Syed, Saba","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100330","20200603",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The role of alexithymia in the mental health problems of home-quarantined university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in China","OBJECTIVE: While it is well known that mental health problems are common consequences of deadly pandemics, the association with alexithymia is less clear. This study examined this association in an evaluation of home-quarantined university students during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: In total, 2501 home-quarantined students from six southwest Chinese universities completed the following questionnaires: the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20), the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL—C), and the Patients Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), after which structural equation modeling (SEM) and mediation analyses were employed to extract and evaluate the possible associations. RESULTS: It was found that participants with probable depression or PTSD also reported more severe alexithymia features, such as difficulties in identifying feelings (DIF) or describing feelings (DDF). Alexithymia was also found to partially mediate the effect of number of exposures on mental health problems. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that implementing strategies to assist young people identify and deal with their own emotions and those of others could prevent or mitigate the mental health problems associated with deadly pandemic events. However, future longitudinal studies are needed to examine the specific involvement of DIF or DDF in people with mental health problems.","Tang, Wanjie; Hu, Tao; Yang, Le; Xu, Jiuping","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110131","20201015",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Media use and acute psychological outcomes during COVID-19 outbreak in China","The COVID-19 outbreak in China led to an extraordinary threat to public health and wellbeing. This study examined the psychological impact of media use among people indirectly exposed to the disease during the initial phase of the outbreak. We conducted an internet-based survey on January 28, 2020 (one week after the official declaration of person-to-person transmission of the coronavirus). Media use (media forms, content of media exposure, and media engagement) related to the outbreak and psychological outcomes (positive and negative affect, anxiety, depression, and stress) of 917 Chinese adults was assessed. A series of multivariable regressions were conducted. The results showed that use of new media, rather than traditional media, was significantly associated with more negative affect, depression, anxiety, and stress. Viewing stressful content (i.e., severity of the outbreak, reports from hospital) was associated with more negative affect and depression. Media engagement was also associated with more negative affect, anxiety, and stress. However, viewing heroic acts, speeches from experts, and knowledge of the disease and prevention were associated with more positive affect and less depression. The study suggested new media use and more media engagement was associated with negative psychological outcomes, while certain media content was associated with positive psychological impact. The present study highlights the need for timely public health communication from official sources and suggests that reduced exposure to new media may be beneficial.","Chao, Miao; Xue, Dini; Liu, Tour; Yang, Haibo; Hall, Brian J.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.janxdis.2020.102248","20200528",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

This study outlines the Greek translation and validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) in the general population. A sample of 3029 Greek-speaking individuals completed the FCV-19S, as part of a large online survey reporting on the aftermath of the coronavirus on the psychological health of Greeks. A total of 2970 participants completed all items without missing values, and their responses were included in the statistical analysis. The confirmatory factor analysis suggested an acceptable model fit. The internal consistency measured by Cronbach’s alpha = .87 for the whole scale.

"COVID-19 and forced alcohol abstinence in India: The dilemmas around ethics and rights","In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other countries across the world, the Central and State Governments of India initiated several measures to slow down the spread of the virus and to ‘flatten the curve’. One such measure was a ‘total lockdown’ for several weeks across the country. A complex and unexpected outcome of the lockdown which has medical, ethical, economic, and social dimensions is related to alcohol consumption. The lockdown and consequent acute non-availability of alcohol resulted in people with alcohol dependence going into withdrawals, black marketing of alcohol, and in extreme cases suicide resulting from the alleged frustration of not having access to alcohol. The health dilemmas around this situation are biological (e.g. pushing people into risky situations-potentially fatal alcohol withdrawal, consumption of illicit or other non-consumable alcohol) and psychosocial (e.g. isolation increasing the risk of relapses, loss of control over the decision to abstain which can be detrimental to recovery, restriction of access to services for alcohol problems). The legal and rights-related dilemmas are centred around whether States have the right to impinge on individual autonomy on the grounds of public health, the capacity of the health systems to provide appropriate services to cope with those who will struggle with the unavailability of alcohol, the constitutionality of the Central government's impinging on jurisdiction of states under the guise of a health emergency caused by the pandemic, and the ability of the State to make unbiased decisions about this issue when it is highly dependent on the revenue from the sale of alcohol and associated industries. The way forward could be a pragmatic and utilitarian approach involving continued access to alcohol, while observing all physical distancing norms necessary during the pandemic, for those who want to continue drinking; and implementing innovative measures such as tele-counselling for those who wish not to return back to drinking.","Nadkarni, Abhijit; Kapoor, Arjun; Pathare, Soumitra","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijlp.2020.101579","20200520",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"How to deal with COVID-19 epidemic-related lockdown physical inactivity and sedentary increase in youth? Adaptation of Anses’ benchmarks","Faced with the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, regulatory measures aiming to prevent interpersonal contaminations have been undertaken and among these, lockdown. Due to strong restrictions out-of-home movements, we hypothesize that overall physical activity will decrease and sedentary behavior increase. This could result in highest exposure to the well-known risk related to insufficient physical activity. To mitigate physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors health-related risks related to children and adolescents lockdown and school closure, Anses (French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety) has adapted, within the first days of the public authorities’ prescription, its former benchmarks. This paper supports and comments Anses’ Opinion by raising the questions of whether, why, and how to deal with short- or medium-term lockdown-related physical inactivity and sedentary behavior increases. Short-term and unknown long term-impacts on mental health and well-being, physical fitness and eating behaviors clearly appearing for children and adolescents as being the main issues of concern are highlighted. Targeting the compensations of the physical inactivity increase, the types, frequencies and durations of physical activity, are adapted to restricted environment. Sedentary behavior limitation and frequent interruptions becomes a priority. Overall, considering children and adolescents, the emerging risk justifies proposing specific adaptations and type of activities in order to ensure maintaining health underpinned, at least partly, by physiological equilibrium and physical fitness and avoid the installation of new unhealthy habits or routines that young people could keep after lockdown.","Margaritis, Irène; Houdart, Sabine; El Ouadrhiri, Youssef; Bigard, Xavier; Vuillemin, Anne; Duché, Pascale","https://www.doi.org/10.1186/s13690-020-00432-z","20200603",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Rapid report: Early demand, profiles and concerns of mental health users during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic","BACKGROUND: Trends in contact with a high volume national digital mental health service (DMHS), the MindSpot Clinic, provide a unique opportunity to assess the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Three methods were used to assess changes in responses to COVID-19. First, website visits and call centre traffic were compared across two time periods: the “comparison period” (1 September 2020 to 28 September 2019), and during the early weeks of the “COVID-19 pandemic” (19 March 2020 to 15 April 2020). Second, demographic and symptom data were compared across all patients who started an assessment during the comparison (n = 1650) and the COVID-19 period (n = 1668). Third, responses to questions about the impact of COVID-19 introduced to the assessment from 19 March 2020, and reports from treating therapists were examined. RESULTS: There was an 89% increase in website visits and a 90% increase in telephone calls to the clinic in the early COVID-19 period compared to the comparison period. There was a higher proportion of females in the COVID-19 sample (76.9% vs. 72.9), and a lower proportion reported being in employment (52.8% vs. 60.8%). There was a small but significant increase in the severity of anxiety symptoms, and an increase in the number of people reporting recent onset of anxiety and depression. However, there were no differences between groups in severity of symptoms of distress or depression. Most people (94%) reported concern about the impact of COVID-19, and 88% reported making changes in lifestyle. Older adults had higher levels of concern about COVID-19. Therapists reported that patients were concerned about how to access testing, manage quarantine, financial security and the effect of social isolation. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has resulted in a significant increase in contact with an established DMHS, but we have not yet detected increases in baseline symptom severity. With the prospect of prolonged restriction of movement, DMHS such as MindSpot could play an important role in both providing clinical services and monitoring the mental health of the population.","Titov, Nickolai; Staples, Lauren; Kayrouz, Rony; Cross, Shane; Karin, Eyal; Ryan, Katie; Dear, Blake; Nielssen, Olav","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.invent.2020.100327","20200601",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

The clinical symptoms are mainly upper respiratory leading to diffuse viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure involving. Kidney, Liver and Heart along with coagulopathies. During 2004 (SARS-CoV) pandemic role of nitric oxide in its management is well demonstrated. Nitric Oxide (NO) reversed pulmonary hypertension. Improved severe hypoxia and shortened the stay in ICU and ventilatory support. Nitric Oxide increased the survival rate. The genetic composition of Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) is almost similar to Covid-19, thus indicates good chances of effectiveness or enhancement in results by Nitric Oxide along with other modes in treatment of Covid-19. It has been proved by studies by serendipity humming increases NO Expression dramatically.It is estimated that humming increases the endogenous generation of nitric oxide level by 15-fold. Hypoxia in ARD Syndrome leads to blood coagulation by depression of body defence anticoagulatory and fibrolytic properties along with metabolic acidosis. If we go into hypoxic hypercapnic state no hyper coagulation takes place.

"Strategies for vaccine design for corona virus using Immunoinformatics techniques","The cutting-edge technology vaccinomics is the combination of two topics immunogenetics and immunogenomics with the knowledge of systems biology and immune profiling for designing vaccine against infectious disease. In our present study, an epitope-based peptide vaccine against nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus, using a combination of B cell and T cell epitope predictions, followed by molecular docking methods are performed. Here, protein sequences of homologous nonstructural protein 4 of beta coronavirus are collected and conserved regions present in them are investigated via phylogenetic study to determine the most immunogenic part of protein. From the identified region of the target protein, the peptide sequence IRNTTNPSAR from the region ranging from 38-47 and the sequence PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG from the positions of 76-90 are considered as the most potential B cell and T cell epitopes respectively. Furthermore, this predicted T cell epitopes PTDTYTSVY and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG interacted with MHC allelic proteins HLA-A*01:01 and HLA-DRB5*01:01 respectively with the low IC50 values. These epitopes are perfectly fitted into the epitope binding grooves of alpha helix of MHC I molecule and MHC II molecule with binding energy scores -725.0 Kcal/mole and -786.0 Kcal/mole respectively, showing stability in MHC molecules binding. This MHC restricted epitope PTDTYTSVY also showed a good conservancy of 50.16% in world population coverage. This MHC I HLA-A*01:01 allele is present among 58.87% of Chinese population also. Therefore, the epitopes IRNTTNPSAR and PTDTYTSVYLGKFRG may be considered as potential peptides for peptide-based vaccine for coronavirus after further experimental study.","Basu, Anamika; Sarkar, Anasua; Maulik, Ujjwal","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.27.967422","20200302",NA,"BioRxiv; MedRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect virulence-related genes in novel agents, as we show here for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.","Bartoszewicz, Jakub M.; Seidel, Anja; Renard, Bernhard Y.","https://www.doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.29.925354","20200130",NA,"BioRxiv; MedRxiv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Panique et pandémie: revue de la littérature sur les liens entre le trouble panique et l'épidémie à SARS-CoV-2","Résumé L’état de panique associé à la pandémie liée au SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) incite à s’interroger sur les troubles anxieux que cette situation pourrait générer ou aggraver. Si la littérature a déjà fourni des projections généralistes en la matière, les données concrètes concernent à ce stage davantage le trouble de stress post-traumatique et le trouble obsessionnel compulsif, tandis que quelques évaluations s’intéressent au cadre nosographie du trouble anxieux généralisé. Le trouble panique ne se voit que peu ou pas cité et l’évocation de la « panique », au sens social, la supplante largement. Bien que d’une légitimité clinique encore débattue, le trouble panique qualifié de « respiratoire » pourrait se voir augmenter en nombre et/ou être intensifié chez les patients qui en présentent déjà. D’éventuelles situations co-morbides entre un tel trouble et la COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) doivent inciter à certaines précautions en matière de prescriptions médicamenteuses, notamment en lien avec les traitements, ou situations, sources d’hypokaliémie : (i) le salbutamol, source potentielle de surconsommation, notamment chez les patients anxieux, (ii) l’infection par le SARS-CoV-2 et plus encore en cas de diarrhées et/ou vomissements. L’hypokaliémie est associée à un risque accru de torsade de pointe, il convient donc également d’être prudent en matière de prescription de psychotropes à risque : comme avec le citalopram et l’escitalopram, des antidépresseurs indiqués dans le trouble panique, ou encore l’hydroxyzine, à visée anxiolytique. Ces données sont de nature à resituer l’importance de la prise en considération du trouble panique dans le cadre de la pandémie en cours. Abstract Although the ‘panic’ word has been abundantly linked to the SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) pandemic in the press, in the scientific literature very few studies have considered whether the current epidemic could predispose to the onset or the aggravation of panic attacks or panic disorder. Indeed, most studies thus far have focused on the risk of increase and aggravation of other psychiatric disorders as a consequence of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Yet, risk of onset or aggravation of panic disorder, especially the subtype with prominent respiratory symptoms, which is characterized by a fear response conditioning to interoceptive sensations (e.g., respiratory), and hypervigilance to these interoceptive signals, could be expected in the current situation. Indeed, respiratory symptoms, such as coughs and dyspnea, are among the most commonly associated with the SARS-CoV-2 (59-82 % and 31-55 %, respectively), and respiratory symptoms are associated with a poor illness prognosis. Hence given that some etiological and maintenance factors associated with panic disorder – i.e., fear conditioning to abnormal breathing patterns attributable or not to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), as well as hypervigilance towards breathing abnormalities – are supposedly more prevalent, one could expect an increased risk of panic disorder onset or aggravation following the COVID-19 epidemic in people who were affected by the virus, but also those who were not. In people with the comorbidity (i.e., panic disorder or panic attacks and the COVID-19), it is particularly important to be aware of the risk of hypokalemia in specific at-risk situations or prescriptions. For instance, in the case of salbutamol prescription, which might be overly used in patients with anxiety disorders and COVID-19, or in patients presenting with diarrhea and vomiting. Hypokalemia is associated with an increased risk of torsade de pointe, thus caution is required when prescribing specific psychotropic drugs, such as the antidepressants citalopram and escitalopram, which are first-line treatments for panic disorder, but also hydroxyzine, aiming at anxiety reduction. The results reviewed here highlight the importance of considering and further investigating the impact of the current pandemic on the diagnosis and treatment of panic disorder (alone or comorbid with the COVID-19).","Javelot, H; Weiner, L","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2020.05.010","20200521",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Human Rights during COVID-19 pandemic The issue of Female Genital Mutilations","Abstract While SARS-CoV-2 has infected millions and claimed more than 250,000 lives, experts are warning that the impact of other diseases neglected due to the pandemic may be just as significant in the months and years to come. Specifically, when health systems are overwhelmed, and people refrain from visiting health facilities due to movement restrictions or fears about illness exposure, both direct mortality and indirect mortality from preventable and treatable conditions increase.1-3 Female genital mutilation (FGM), also named female genital cutting, is acknowledged as a violation of human rights of women.4 The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals called for the elimination of the practice by 2030.5 FGM is referred to as any procedure involving the alteration or excision of external female genitalia without medical indication,6 and 3 million women in the world are estimated to be at risk of undergoing this procedure annually.6 It is a major public health problem in several countries in Africa and Middle East,6,7 being almost universal in seven African countries (prevalence >85%).6 A report from UNICEF highlighted how this practice is still being widely carried out in 29 countries in Africa and in Middle East, despite the fact that at least 24 of these countries have legislation or some form of decrees against FGM.8 However, some evident progress is ongoing: under the new FGM amendment to the criminal law in Sudan that was approved very recently (22 April 2020), anyone who performs FGM either inside a medical establishment or elsewhere faces three years' imprisonment and fine. 9 Studies conducted in different settings have clearly showed an adverse effect of FGM on psychological, sexual and reproductive health unfavourable outcomes. 10 This includes posttraumatic stress disorder,11 dyspareunia and genitourinary complications. Adverse obstetric outcomes, such as increased risk for caesarean delivery, episiotomy and postpartum haemorrhage, are also more frequent.12 Scar tissue, especially in women with FGM type III (infibulation) can result in obstructed labour or obstetric trauma.13 It is known that in situations of conflicts and disaster, gender inequality, gender-based violence and violation of human rights are likely to increase, as protection and health system are disrupted, leaving acts of violence unpunished and condoned by the societies. This applies to health emergencies as well, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. FGM, early marriage and violence against women and girls are life-threatening, health and human rights challenge, due to the inequal relations, and patriarchal rules.14 Survivors are left no choice or right of determination over their bodies, physical, and sexual and reproductive health. Estimates provided by Avenir Health, Johns Hopkins University (USA) and Victoria University (Australia) predict that significant levels of lockdown-related disruption over 6 months may cause significant delays in programmes to end female genital mutilation, potentially leading to around 2 million more cases of FGM over the next decade than would otherwise have occurred.15 These striking figures become even more daunting when compounded with the expected additional 31 million cases of gender-based violence and the 13 million more child marriages over the next 10 years.15 Support to continued access to reproductive health care services and protection of the rights and dignity of all women and girls remains even more critical in contexts such as the current pandemic. To do so, preparedness and response plans must incorporate and integrate Female Genital Mutilation in Gender-Based Violence, and Sexual and Reproductive Health Programmes, including in community awareness initiatives and activities, thus ensuring risk mitigation as well as remote and mobile case management.","Bellizzi, S.; Nivoli, A.; Lorettu, L.; Ronzoni, A.

"Beyond the virus: Ensuring continuity of care for people with diabetes during COVID-19","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a major concern for the diabetes community. A meta-analysis in China found that the proportions of people with COVID-19 and diabetes was 9.7% and that having diabetes resulted in a two-fold increased risk of having a severe case. Global guidance on confinement measures for the prevention of COVID-19 have a particular emphasis on vulnerable populations which include people with diabetes. These recommendations are coherent to avoid the spread of SARSCoV-2 infection, but are in contradiction with comprehensive diabetes care, which requires regular patient–provider interactions for patient education, prescriptions and possible management of complications or mental health. Moreover, confinement drives risk for unhealthy diets, decreased physical activity, mental health related concerns, in parallel to delayed care-seeking due to fear of contracting COVID-19. Another weakness in the current COVID-19 response is the focus on hospital care which overlooks the importance of Primary Care in guaranteeing continuity of care. Ensuring the availability of insulin, other medicines, self-monitoring and diagnostic tools is another challenge. These are all global concerns for the diabetes community, as well as for those suffering from other chronic conditions. Undoubtedly, the global priority is to contain the spread and impact of COVID-19. However, health systems still need to meet the needs of the entire population, including individuals with diabetes. Clear guidance for preparedness, crisis and post-crisis management of diabetes and chronic diseases during mass disruptions to health systems are lacking. Therefore, in parallel to the epidemic response efforts to ensure existing healthcare services keep running should be supported to avoid health consequences that might be worse than the epidemic itself. This includes targeted messaging for people with diabetes and vulnerable populations with regards to possible risk of infection as well as their disease-related management; continued support via telephone, video conferencing or even home visits; ensuring access to insulin and other medicines and supplies both nationally and individually; and most importantly, preparing for the future.","Beran, David; Aebischer Perone, Sigiriya; Castellsague Perolini, Montserrat; Chappuis, François; Chopard, Pierre; Haller, Dagmar M.; Jacquerioz Bausch, Frédérique; Maisonneuve, Hubert; Perone, Nicolas; Gastaldi, Giacomo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2020.05.014","20200530",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Online Mental Health Survey in a Medical College in China During the COVID-19 Outbreak","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, Hubei province, has led to the quarantine of many residents in their homes, in order to mitigate its spread. Some of these people developed mental health problems, and many solutions have been put in place to address the mental health issues of patients and health professionals affected by the disease. However, not much attention has been given to students, particularly those from medical school. The present study aims to conduct an online survey to investigate the mental health status of students from a medical college in Hubei province. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The WeChat-based survey program Questionnaire Star, which contained questions from Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), was utilized for the present study. RESULTS: A total of 217 students participated in the survey. Among these students, 127 were female and 90 were male. Furthermore, 77 students (35.5%) who participated in the survey were in a state of depression, and 48 (22.1%) were in a state of anxiety. The majority of students who were in depressed (n=75) or anxiety (n=46) states had mild or moderate states. There were no significant differences in students in terms of gender, geographical location, and grade, for the prevalence of depression and anxiety.

Executive Order 20-28 authorizes out-of-state mental health providers to treat Minnesota patients via telehealth services to “help ensure that the mental health needs of Minnesotans are met during the stress and uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.” The order notes that many Minnesotans receive mental health care from providers in neighboring states, and this order will allow them to continue that care via virtual means. Gov. Walz has been trying to expand Minnesota's mental health care options during COVID-19, asking President Trump for a major disaster declaration so the state can be reimbursed for expanding community-based crisis counseling services. Executive Order 20-29 amends a previous order, EO 20-05, that was designed to help Minnesotans get unemployment insurance as quickly as possible rather than waiting the previous week following the loss of their jobs.

This study, which employed a cross-sectional design, aimed to assess the mental health of emergency department medical staff during the epidemic in China. METHODS: Demographic data and mental health measurements were collected by electronic questionnaires from February 28, 2020 to March 18, 2020. OUTCOMES: A total of 14,825 doctors and nurses in 31 provinces of mainland China completed the survey. The prevalence rates of depressive symptoms and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were 25.2% and 9.1%, respectively. Men were more likely to have depressive symptoms and PTSD than women. Those who were middle aged, worked for fewer years, had longer daily work time, and had lower levels of social support were at a higher risk of developing depressive symptoms and PTSD. Working in the Hubei province was associated with a higher risk of depressive symptoms, while those working in the Hubei province but residing in another province had a lower risk of depressive symptoms and PTSD. Being a nurse was associated with a higher risk of PTSD. INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that targeted psychological interventions to promote the mental health of medical staff with psychological problems need to be immediately implemented.

"A Feminist Perspective on COVID-19 and the Value of Care Work Globally","The shared response to the COVID-19 crisis demonstrates that the vast majority of society believes human well-being - not economic growth - should be at the center of policy. COVID-19 exposes the foundational role of care work, both paid and unpaid, to functioning societies and economies. Focusing on ""production"" instead of the sustainable reproduction of human life devalues care work and those who perform it. Women's physical and mental health, and the societies that rely on them, are at stake. When these policies are formulated, the field of feminist economics has valuable lessons for mitigating hardships as countries navigate the related economic fallout.

"Chapter 27 Emergence and Reemergence of Viral Zoonotic Diseases: Concepts and Factors of Emerging and Reemerging Globalization of Health Threats","Abstract The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence, as a sanitary event, are only the visible part of the iceberg, while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors, including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence. According to the World Health Organization, 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom, and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir. Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem, taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human, animal, and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health, One World,” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete. The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens, the change of human lifestyle, the globalization of travel, business exchanges, and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human, animal, and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).","El Amri, Hamid; Boukharta, Mohamed; Zakham, Fathiah; Ennaji, Moulay Mustapha","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-819400-3.00027-2","20201231",NA,"Elsevier; PMC","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"The psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China","OBJECTIVE: An outbreak of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan (Hubei, China) in December, 2019. Facing this largescale infectious public health event, everyone is under great psychological pressure. The aim was to investigate the psychological status of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak in China. METHODS: The online cross-sectional study involving 922 participants (656 medical staff and 266 general population) was conducted in China between February and March, 2020. The psychological status was evaluated using the Symptom Check List 90 Revised (SCL-90). Linear and logistic regression analysis were used to examine the effect in the study. RESULTS: Of the 922 participants, approximately 18.3% had psychological health problems. The score of the SCL-90 was significant higher in medical staff (mean = 1.49) than that in general population (mean = 1.36). In addition, the participants enrolled in March were less likely to have psychological health problems than in February (odds ratio = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.59). Female had a 1.44-fold risk of psychological health problems than male (95% CI = 1.01 to 2.03). CONCLUSIONS: In the study, 18.3% had psychological health problems during the outbreak of COVID-19 epidemic. With the remission of the epidemic, the psychological health status of participants has been improved. Medical staff were likely to have higher SCL-90 scores than general population and female had more psychological problems than male. Our findings can be used to formulate psychological interventions for improving the mental health of vulnerable groups during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Zhu, Zhen; Liu, Qi; Jiang, Xiaobing; Manandhar, Upasana; Luo, Zhongyu; Zheng, Xu; Li, Yuanyuan; Xie, Jun; Zhang, Bo","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.05.026","20200528",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Rapid Systematic Review: The Impact of Social Isolation and Loneliness on the Mental Health of Children and Adolescents in the Context of COVID-19","OBJECTIVE: Disease containment of COVID-19 has necessitated widespread social isolation. We aimed to establish what is known about how loneliness and disease containment measures impact on the mental health in children and adolescents. METHOD: For this rapid review, we searched MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, and Web of Science for articles published between 01/01/1946 and 03/29/2020. 20% of articles were double screened using pre-defined criteria and 20% of data was double extracted for quality assurance. RESULTS: 83 articles (80 studies) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 63 studies reported on the impact of social isolation and loneliness on the mental health of previously healthy children and adolescents (n=51,576; mean age 15.3) 61 studies were observational; 18 were longitudinal and 43 cross sectional studies assessing self-reported loneliness in healthy children and adolescents. One of these studies was a retrospective investigation after a pandemic. Two studies evaluated interventions. Studies had a high risk of bias although longitudinal studies were of better methodological quality. Social isolation and loneliness increased the risk of depression, and possibly anxiety at the time loneliness was measured and between 0.25 to 9 years later. Duration of loneliness was more strongly correlated with mental health symptoms than intensity of loneliness. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents are probably more likely to experience high rates of depression and probably anxiety during and after enforced isolation ends. This may increase as enforced isolation continues. Clinical services should offer preventative support and early intervention where possible and be prepared for an increase in mental health problems.","Loades, Maria Elizabeth; Chatburn, Eleanor; Higson-Sweeney, Nina; Reynolds, Shirley; Shafran, Roz; Brigden, Amberly; Linney, Catherine; McManus, Megan Niamh; Borwick, Catherine; Crawley, Esther","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaac.2020.05.009","20200603",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"Psychological impact of healthcare workers in China during COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic: a multi-center cross-sectional survey investigation","BACKGROUND: : Since the outbreak of 2019 new coronavirus (COVID-19) pneumonia, healthcare workers (HCW) have suffered psychological stress. The present study is to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression of HCW in China during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to determine the risk factors predicting psychological morbidities that can be used as psychological intervention targets. METHODS: : A cross-sectional survey was conducted to investigate the psychological levels of HCW in multiple centers in China. The prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression were determined by using Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) and Hospital Anxiety / Depression scale (HAD). Psychology related factors were evaluated and correlation between job title and contact history was analyzed. RESULTS: : We received 958 of effective responses, 73.6% of which were from Wuhan and 67.2% were female participants. 55.1% of respondents had psychological stress that is higher than that of HCW during SARS. 54.2% and 58% of participants had symptoms of anxiety and depression. Stress levels of HCW were different in job titles and years of work experience. Anxiety and depression levels were different between different gender, job titles, degrees of protective measures and levels of contact history. Gender, intermediate title, protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for anxiety. Protective measures and contact history were the independent risk factors for depression. CONCLUSIONS: : The COVID-19 epidemic has induced stress levels for HCW, and high percentages of HCW have anxiety and depression. The situation of HCW is worrying and intervention service is urgent.","Xiao, Xiao; Zhu, Xiaobin; Fu, Shuai; Hu, Yugang; Li, Xiaoning; Xiao, Jinsong","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.081","20200519",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"

"Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Role of Insomnia","There is growing concern over the potential for increased suicide risk in vulnerable populations as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. To contextualize this risk during the first weeks of the nation-wide lockdown efforts, we had 1,013 U.S. adults complete questionnaires assessing worries over COVID-19, insomnia severity, and suicidal ideation. Anxiety about COVID-19 correlated positively with insomnia severity and suicidal ideation. Analysis revealed that the statistical association between pandemic fears and suicidal thinking was fully accounted for by insomnia severity, suggesting that interventions aimed at improving sleep may be useful in reducing suicide risk during the current pandemic.","Killgore, William D.S.; Cloonen, Sara A.; Taylor, Emily C.; Fernandez, Fabian; Grandner, Michael A.; Dailey, Natalie S.","https://www.doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2020.113134","20200527",NA,"Elsevier; PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
"DEA allows buprenorphine inductions based on telephone only","Last week, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA)–waived prescribers can treat new patients with buprenorphine based on a telephone call only. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), enforced by the DEA, requires all new patients being treated with controlled substances to have an in-person — or, for now, telemedicine — physical exam. Now, however, because of the coexisting COVID-19 pandemic and opioid overdose crisis, the DEA has dropped this requirement. This follows the decision of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to allow exemptions from the OTP take-home regulations allowing stable patients to be given 14 or 28 days of methadone doses, instead of coming in more frequently (see DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID-19, ADAW March 23, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32664).","Knopf, Alison","https://www.doi.org/10.1002/adaw.32680","20200403",NA,"PMC; WHO","","","","","","","","","","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","","","","","FALSE","FALSE","FALSE","","2020-10-27"
