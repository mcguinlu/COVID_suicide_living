"In the shadow of COVID-19: HIV-infected individuals need more attention","COVID-19 pandemic has made the medical situation of HIV-infected individuals more complicated in low-income countries especially those with high incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Besides, the COVID-19 pandemic may also have an impact on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients' access to medical services. Although the difference between COVID-19 prevalence in HIV-infected individuals and general population is still unclear, the physical and mental health status of HIV infected people are needed to pay more attention on account of their growing concern of health status during COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we suggested that future studies should explore the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and health outcomes of HIV/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection patients. Besides, rapid identification of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection among HIV population through the high-risk population screening and the international assistance for low-income countries could be warranted.

"It Is Not Just Mortality: A Call From Chile for Comprehensive COVID-19 Policy Responses Among Older People","Provide a synthesis of the COVID-19 policies targeting older people in Chile, stressing their short- and long-term challenges. Critical analysis of the current legal and policy measures, based on national-level data and international experiences. Although several policies have been enacted to protect older people from COVID-19, these measures could have important unintended negative consequences in this group's mental and physical health, as well as financial aspects. A wider perspective is needed to include a broader definition of health-considering financial scarcity, access to health services, mental health issues, and long-term care-in the policy responses to COVID-19 targeted to older people in Chile.","Villalobos Dintrans, Browne, Madero-Cabib","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbaa092","20200731","COVID-19; Health care policy; Health-related quality of life; Policy analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3615,""
"Debate: COVID crisis, natural capital and clinical care - 'building back better' for a new values-based CAMHS","The COVID-19 pandemic has meant upheaval for child and adolescent mental health services and for children, young people and their families. We look at this disruption through the lens of values-based practice. We also briefly examine the concept of natural capital and the opportunity for 'Building Back Better' post-COVID. We suggest that as well as losses, there are also opportunities to rethink and reshape our practices to make them more value-based.","Tan, Fulford","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12410","20200731","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3616,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on Bangladeshi readymade garment (RMG) workers","This paper describes the potential impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the readymade garment (RMG) workers of Bangladesh. It articulates the RMG workers' existing vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic based on currently available evidence and personal conversations/communications with RMG workers. COVID-19 has already impacted RMG workers' health (both physical and mental health status) and wellbeing, and resulted in loss of employment. We argue that the COVID-19 pandemic will have long-lasting effects on the garment workers, especially related to their health issues, financial hardship and inability to pay for essentials such as food, and future employment opportunities. The stakeholders (such as the international retailers/brands, Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Government of Bangladesh) responsible for the global supply chain RMG factories should reconsider the health and overall wellbeing needs of the RMG workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Kabir, Maple, Usher","https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdaa126","20200731","Bangladesh; COVID-19; crisis; health vulnerabilities; readymade garment workers; starvation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3617,""
"Safety and Efficacy of Casting during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparison of the Mechanical Properties of Polymers Used for 3D Printing to Conventional Materials Used for the Generation of Orthopaedic Orthoses","To reduce the risk of spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), the emerging protocols are advising for less physician-patient contact, shortening the contact time, and keeping a safe distance. It is recommended that unnecessary casting be avoided in the events that alternative methods can be applied such as in stable ankle fractures, and hindfoot/midfoot/forefoot injuries. Fiberglass casts are suboptimal because they require a follow up for cast removal while a conventional plaster cast is amenable to self-removal by submerging in water and cutting the cotton bandages with scissors. At present, only fiberglass casts are widely available to allow waterproof casting. To reduce the contact time during casting, a custom-made 3D printed casts/splints can be ordered remotely which reduces the number of visits and shortens the contact time while it allows for self-removal by the patient. The cast is printed after the limb is 3D scanned in 5-10 seconds using the commercially available 3D scanners. In contrast to the conventional casting, a 3D printed cast/splint is washable which is an advantage during an infectious crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sedigh, Kachooei, Beredjiklian, Vaccaro, Rivlin","https://doi.org/10.22038/abjs.2020.44038.2204","20200731","3D Printing; COVID-19; Coronavirus; Orthopaedic cast; Orthopaedic splint","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3618,""
"Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life and Influencing Factors for COVID-19 Patients, a Follow-Up at One Month","To survey the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its influencing factors among patients with COVID-19 in their first medical follow up. All patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were discharged from 12 hospitals in Wenzhou, Zhejiang from Jan 17, 2020 to Mar 20, 2020. Prospectively collected and analyzed data included demographics, clinical symptoms, comorbidity, and chest CT imaging features at the first follow up, 1 month after discharge. All patients underwent the HRQoL evaluation with the Chinese version of Short-Form 36-item questionnaire (SF-36) as well as a general condition questionnaire. Factors associated with SF-36 wereÃ‚Â constructed using linear regression. Predictors of impaired physical component summary (PCS) and a mental component summary (MCS) were identified by logistic regression. SF-36 demonstrated a significant difference in HRQoL in patients with COVID-19, except in physical function (PF), when compared to the general Chinese population (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). The multiple linear regressions demonstrated that age was negatively associated with PF, role physical (RP), but positively associated with vitality (VT) (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). PF, bodily pain (BP), and role-emotional (RE) were negatively associated with the female sex (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05). For mental health, the clinical subtypes were significant associated factors (<i>pÃ¢â‚¬Å </i>&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). Length of stay (LOS) was strongly negativelyÃ‚Â associated with RE and RP, and positively associated with VT (<i>p</i>&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.05). Logistical regression revealed that non-obese overweight (OR 3.71) and obesity (OR 3.94) were risk factors for a low PCS and female sex (OR 2.22) was a risk factor for a low MCS. Health-related quality of life was poor among COVID-19 patients at the 1 month follow-up. Patients suffered from significant physical and psychological impairment. Therefore, prospective monitoring of individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2 is needed in order to fully understand the long-term impact of COVID-19, as well as to inform prompt and efficient interventions to alleviate suffering.","Chen, Li, Gong, Zhang, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00668","20200731","COVID-19; SF-36; follow-up; health-related quality of life; influencing factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3619,""
"The double-edged relationship between COVID-19 stress and smoking: Implications for smoking cessation","Although recent research shows that smokers respond differently to the COVID-19 pandemic, it offers little explanation of why some have increased their smoking, while others decreased it. In this study, we examined a possible explanation for these different responses: pandemic-related stress. We conducted an online survey among a representative sample of Dutch current smokers from 11-18 May 2020 (n=957). During that period, COVID-19 was six weeks past the (initial) peak of cases and deaths in the Netherlands. Included in the survey were measures of how the COVID-19 pandemic had changed their smoking, if at all (no change, increased smoking, decreased smoking), and a measure of stress due to COVID-19. Overall, while 14.1% of smokers reported smoking less due to the COVID-19 pandemic, 18.9% of smokers reported smoking more. A multinomial logistic regression analysis revealed that there was a dose-response effect of stress: smokers who were somewhat stressed were more likely to have either increased (OR=2.37; 95% CI: 1.49-3.78) or reduced (OR=1.80; 95% CI: 1.07-3.05) their smoking. Severely stressed smokers were even more likely to have either increased (OR=3.75; 95% CI: 1.84-7.64) or reduced (OR=3.97; 95% CI: 1.70-9.28) their smoking. Thus, stress was associated with both increased and reduced smoking, independently from perceived difficulty of quitting and level of motivation to quit. Stress related to the COVID-19 pandemic appears to affect smokers in different ways, some smokers increase their smoking while others decrease it. While boredom and restrictions in movement might have stimulated smoking, the threat of contracting COVID-19 and becoming severely ill might have motivated others to improve their health by quitting smoking. These data highlight the importance of providing greater resources for cessation services and the importance of creating public campaigns to enhance cessation in this dramatic time.","Bommele, Hopman, Walters, Geboers, Croes, Fong, Quah, Willemsen","https://doi.org/10.18332/tid/125580","20200731","COVID-19; The Netherlands; smoking; smoking behavior; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3620,""
"Psychiatric face of COVID-19","The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a severe multiorgan pathology which, besides cardio-respiratory manifestations, affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), similarly to other coronaviruses demonstrate neurotropism; the viral infection of the brain stem may complicate the course of the disease through damaging central cardio-respiratory control. The systemic inflammation as well as neuroinflammatory changes are associated with massive increase of the brain pro-inflammatory molecules, neuroglial reactivity, altered neurochemical landscape and pathological remodelling of neuronal networks. These organic changes, emerging in concert with environmental stress caused by experiences of intensive therapy wards, pandemic fears and social restrictions, promote neuropsychiatric pathologies including major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder (BD), various psychoses, obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. The neuropsychiatric sequelae of COVID-19 represent serious clinical challenge that has to be considered for future complex therapies.","Steardo, Steardo, Verkhratsky","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-020-00949-5","20200731","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3621,""

"Resilience contributes to low emotional impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among the general population in Italy","Background The COVID-19 outbreak is severely affecting overall mental health with unknown psychological consequences. The Italian Government has implemented a massive lockdown to decrease the spread of the virus. Although a strong psychological impact is possible, few evidences are still available. Past studies have shown that resilience decreases the negative effects of stress promoting mental health. For these reasons, this study aimed to examine depression, anxiety, and stress among the Italian general population during the phase characterizing by lockdown, and to investigate the role of resilience as a potential predictor. Methods A total sample of 6314 Italian people participated in this study. Participants were recruited between March 10 and May 4 2020 through an online survey, the majority of whom from Northern Italy. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21) (a measure of mental health status) and the Resilience Scale (RS) (a measure of resilience) were administered. Also, demographic data and lockdown related information were collected. DASS-21 cut-off scores were used to verify the mental status among the participants. Subsequently, a correlational analysis was carried out to examine relationships between DASS-21 and RS. Lastly, three hierarchical regression analyses were conducted using the three DASS-21 scales as dependent variables and the RS scales as independent variables controlling for age, gender, and education. Results The prevalence of moderate to extremely severe symptoms among participants was 36.1% for depression, 28.7% for anxiety, and 35.6% for stress. Results of correlational analysis showed that resilience factors, such as meaningfulness, self-reliance, existential aloneness, and equanimity, are inversely associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. Results of regression analyses indicated that all the resilience factors were statistically significant in predicting anxiety, while meaningfulness, perseverance, existential aloneness, and equanimity predicted depression and stress. Conclusions During the lockdown following the COVID-19 outbreak, about a third of respondents reported moderate to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress. The present study suggests that psychological resilience may independently contribute to low emotional distress and psychological ill-being. These findings can help explain the variability of individual responses during the COVID-19 outbreak. Psychological interventions to enhance resilience might provide useful approaches to overcome COVID-related emotional impact.","Vittorio Lenzo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/461DD-344-7DB","20200801","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Anxiety Disorders; clinical psychology; depression; dass-21; resilience; anxiety; covid-19; stress; resilience scale","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-01","",3624,""
"The COVID-19 Coping Study: A longitudinal mixed-methods study of mental health and well-being among older US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective To describe the methodology and baseline cohort characteristics of the COVID-19 Coping Study, a longitudinal mixed-methods study of US adults aged =55. Methods Participants were recruited through online multi-frame non-probability sampling in April and May, 2020. The baseline questionnaire focused on the effects of COVID-19 on daily life and mental health. Monthly follow-ups will be conducted for one year. Findings In total, 6,938 adults participated across all 50 US states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico (mean [SD] age: 67.3 [7.9]; 64% female). Two in three adults reported leaving home only for essential purposes in the past week (population-weighted proportion: 69%; 95% CI: 68%-71%). One-quarter of older adults in work before the pandemic reported reduced work hours or income (25%; 95% CI: 22%-27%). One in three screened positive for depression (32%; 95% CI: 30%-34%) and anxiety (29%; 95% CI: 28%-31%). Conclusions We observed substantial self-reported effects of COVID-19 on daily life and prevalent mental health symptoms in this cohort. Policy Implications Data may inform policies to support mental health and well-being among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lindsay C.
