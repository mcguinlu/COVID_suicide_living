"Sustained negative mental health outcomes among healthcare workers over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: a prospective cohort study","Objective: To characterize the evolution of healthcare workers' mental health status over the 1-year period following the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and to examine baseline characteristics associated with resolution or persistence of mental health problems over time. Methods: We conducted an 8-month follow-up cohort study. Eligible participants were healthcare workers working in Spain. Baseline data were collected during the initial pandemic outbreak. Survey-based self-reported measures included COVID-19-related exposures, sociodemographic characteristics, and three mental health outcomes (psychological distress, depression symptoms, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms). We examined three longitudinal trajectories in mental health outcomes between baseline and follow-up assessments (namely asymptomatic/stable, recovering, and persistently symptomatic/worsening). Results: We recruited 1,807 participants. Between baseline and follow-up assessments, the proportion of respondents screening positive for psychological distress and probable depression decreased, respectively, from 74% to 56% and from 28% to 21%. Two-thirds remained asymptomatic/stable in terms of depression symptoms and 56% remained symptomatic or worsened over time in terms of psychological distress. Conclusions: Poor mental health outcomes among healthcare workers persisted over time. Occupational programs and mental health strategies should be put in place.","Roberto Mediavilla; Eduardo Fernandez-Jimenez; Irene Martinez-Morata; Fabiola Jaramillo; Jorge Andreo-Jover; Ines Moran-Sanchez; Franco Mascayano; Berta Moreno-Kustner; Sergio Minue; Jose Luis Ayuso-Mateos; Richard A Bryant; Maria-Fe Bravo-Ortiz; Gonzalo Martinez-Ales; - COVID-19 HEalth caRe wOrkErS Spain (HEROES-SPA) Group","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.21.21266594","20211124","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22678,""
"The Failures of an Ideal COVID-19 Vaccine: A Simulation Study","This paper simulates an ideal COVID-19 vaccine that confers immediate sterilizing immunity against all SARS-CoV-2 variants. The purpose was to explore how well this ideal vaccine could protect a population against common conditions (such as vaccine hesitancy) that might impair vaccine effectiveness. Simulations were done with an SEIRS spreadsheet model that ran two parallel subpopulations: one that accepted vaccination, and another that refused it. The two subpopulations could transmit infections to one another. Success was judged by the rate of new cases in the period from 1-5 years after the introduction of the vaccine. Under good conditions, including a small subpopulation that refused vaccination, rapid distribution of the vaccine, duration of vaccinal immunity longer than 12 months, good retention of interest in getting vaccinated after the first year, strict maintenance of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as masking, and new variants with R0s less than 4.0, the vaccine was able to end the epidemic. With violation of these conditions, the post-vaccine era futures ranged from endemic COVID at a low or medium level to rates of COVID cases worse than anything seen in the US up to late 2021. The most important conditions for keeping case rates low were a fast speed of vaccine distribution, a low percentage of the population that refuses vaccination, a long duration of vaccinal immunity, and continuing maintenance of NPIs after vaccination began. On the other hand, a short duration of vaccinal immunity, abandonment of NPIs, and new variants with a high R0 were powerful barriers to disease control. New variants with high R0s were particularly damaging, producing high case rates except when vaccination speed was unrealistically rapid. A recurring finding was that most disease afflicting the vaccinated population in these simulations originated in the unvaccinated population, and cutting off interaction with the unvaccinated population caused a sharp drop in the case rate of the vaccinated population. In conclusion, multiple common conditions can compromise the effectiveness of even an ideal vaccine.","Robert Joseph Kosinski","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.22.21266669","20211124","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22679,""
"A genome-wide association study of COVID-19 related hospitalization in Spain reveals genetic disparities among sexes","We describe the results of the Spanish Coalition to Unlock Research on Host Genetics on COVID-19 (SCOURGE). In sex-disaggregated genome-wide studies of COVID-19 hospitalization, we found two known loci associated among males (SLC6A20-LZTFL1 and IFNAR2), and a novel one among females (TLE1). Meta-analyses with independent studies revealed two novel associations (AQP3 and ARHGAP33) and replicated ELF5. A genetic risk score predicted COVID-19 severity, especially among younger males. We found less SNP-heritability and larger heritability differences by age (<60/[&ge;]60 years) among males than females. Inbreeding depression was associated with COVID-19 hospitalization and severity, and the effect was stronger among older males.","- Spanish COalition to Unlock Research on host GEnetics on COVID-19 (SCOURGE); Angel Carracedo","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.24.21266741","20211124","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22680,""
"POSITIVE COGNITIVE TRIAD AND COVID-19 FEARS: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has produced both physical and mental health crisis at an unprecedented level forcing the global community to take actions to deal with the pandemic. Various mental health issues have cropped up in people since the spread of the highly contagious disease. The present empirical study examined the role of the positive cognitive triad in coping with mental health problems, especially the fears of the pandemic. Using <U+0430> cross-sectional research design, data were collected from the 240 participants in a northern state in India at the time when the positive cases were increasing. Regression analysis showed significant variation explained by positive cognitive triad on the outcome variable, i.e. positive cognitive triad reduces the perception of fears of the COVID-19 disease. The study revealed that the positive cognitive triad might be used as one of the coping strategies with the fears and anxiety of the disease. Regression analysis further revealed that two dimensions of the positive cognitive triad i.e. positive cognition of the self and positive cognition of the future, had a significantly negative influence on the fears of the disease. Thus, people who have positive cognition of the self and the future are less likely to experience fear of the novel COVID-19 diseases.","Md Hassan, Jafri","https://doi.org/10.37708/psyct.v14i2.544","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Psychological Thought; 14(2):510-526, 2021.; Publication details: Psychological Thought; 14(2):510-526, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22681,""
"The circlet effects of Covid-19 pandemic and major crisis faced by developing nation: Now and beyond","COVID-19 has taken over the world as the largest viral outbreak in the past 100 years. With over 13 million confirmed cases and 0.5 million-plus people dead, it has affected the life around us. With Pakistan being amongst the top 15 countries affected by it, the government of Pakistan has started vaccination, issued SOPs on daily life and smart lockdown continues in the country, but a part of this activity developing countries are still facing even greater difficulties in handling this crisis. This paper was designed to evaluate the status of scientific literature available on Covid-19 pandemic and to relate this situation from Pakistan perspective. A detailed review of published literature was conducted from March 2020 to August 2020.

"Exploring How Ontario Teachers Adapted to Learn-at-Home Initiatives During COVID-19: Blending Technological and Pedagogical Expertise in a Time of Growing Inequities","At-home learning initiatives arose as a response to school closures due to COVID-19. This study interviewed 17 secondary teachers to explore the implementation of at-home learning in the province of Ontario, Canada. Findings suggest four thematic areas arising from the data: growing equity disparities, poor policy communication, factors influencing successful emergency remote teaching (technological and pedagogical), and impacts to academic and socio-emotional/mental health. This article proposes an integrated model for school recovery that will engage three levels of the education system: (1) school-level efforts including high-dosage tutoring and teacher collaboration and teacher looping strategies, (2) building partnerships with community organizations for wrap-around support for the most marginalized communities, and (3) parental engagement through actionable messages and tips by text to help parents support student learning.

"The use of online learning environments in higher education as a response to the confinement caused by COVID-19","In Colombia, a developing country, higher education has a gross coverage rate of about 40% (supply concerning the entire population). However, although this value is low, ten years ago this rate barely exceeded 20%. The increase in coverage is largely due to a policy that has promoted training by cycles. This model allows education by levels with the granting of professional degrees at each stage, which allows for rapid employment. Even so, places are limited, particularly for medium and low economic levels (which concentrate the majority of the population), and access to them in public universities (those with state-funded enrolment) is very restricted. Access to education is a major concern for institutions and the state, in particular for vulnerable social groups, and has been further depressed by the security and control measures implemented to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 virus. In a short time, and with limited resources, institutions have had to adapt their models to guarantee continuity and quality in academic processes. In this context, digital platforms have come to play a fundamental role by allowing access while reducing social interaction. However, the use of these platforms implies the development of specific learning environments adapted to academic, economic, and social conditions. This paper explores the design, development, and impact of some of these learning environments in the process of technological training of students from low economic strata in the most important public university in the Colombian capital. The initial results of this study show that the distance learning model adopted as a response to social isolation does affect students' academic performance. Besides, the results also show that there are effects on the students' interaction schemes and their motivational levels towards their training process.

"Deployment of COVID-19 vaccines: Are we all in this together?","COVID-19 has exposed weaknesses in global health, and the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines has brought the importance of global cooperation to the forefront of the pandemic. Since its writing, I have rethought the vision I advanced in my lead paper (Kohler 2021b), as recently Canada has shown its preference for a â€œmy nation firstâ€ approach in turning to COVAX to secure vaccines for Canadians, undercutting its moral leadership and commitment to global health. We remain without a strong global public health leader who is able to ensure that public health cooperation advances during this pandemic. While the authors of the commentaries differ on where and how the WHO requires changes, there is agreement on the critical need for its institutional reform.

"Mental health of the people of northern Iran during the quarantine time of 2020 following the coronavirus epidemic","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease. Quarantine is often accompanied by unpleasant experiences for those who go through it. The aim of this study was to determine the mental health status of people during quarantine in northern Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted during the quarantine period of coronavirus. Conventional sampling was done from March 6 to April 6. Six hundred and forty-two individuals were included. Inclusion criteria were living in Sari and being home quarantined during the corona outbreak. Exclusion criteria included hospitalization history due to corona and unwillingness to participate in the study. In this study, the General Health Questionnaire-28 was used online to collect the required data. To analyze the data, descriptive and inferential statistics (t-test, analysis of variance, and correlation coefficient) were used. RESULTS: In this study, individuals were included in the investigation with a mean age of 38.74 Â± 11.89 (ranged from 15 to 73). Most of the participants were female (72.85%) and married (71.34%). According to the results, 21.5% of the participants had poor mental health. Mean mental health scores have a statistically significant relationship with gender, marital status, education, occupation, quarantine period, patients with corona, and exposure to a patient with corona (P = 0.05). Furthermore, a negative correlation coefficient was observed between age and mental health score (correlation coefficient = -0.31, significance &gt;0.001). CONCLUSION: The average score of mental health has a significant relationship with gender, marital status, education, occupation, quarantine period, corona, and exposure to a patient with corona. Given the high prevalence of mental disorders in people during the COVID-19 epidemic, educating people and planning to reduce the psychological effects of the epidemic can be helpful.

"Health, Lifestyle, and Psycho-Social Determinants of Poor Sleep Quality During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Focus on UK Older Adults Deemed Clinically Extremely Vulnerable","Background: Several studies have assessed the impact of COVID-19-related lockdowns on sleep quality across global populations. However, no study to date has specifically assessed at-risk populations, particularly those at highest risk of complications from coronavirus infection deemed â€œclinically-extremely-vulnerable-(COVID-19CEV)â€ (as defined by Public Health England). Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we surveyed 5,558 adults aged =50 years (of whom 523 met criteria for COVID-19CEV) during the first pandemic wave that resulted in a nationwide-lockdown (Aprilâ€“June 2020) with assessments of sleep quality (an adapted sleep scale that captured multiple sleep indices before and during the lockdown), health/medical, lifestyle, psychosocial and socio-demographic factors. We examined associations between these variables and sleep quality;and explored interactions of COVID-19CEV status with significant predictors of poor sleep, to identify potential moderating factors. Results: Thirty-seven percent of participants reported poor sleep quality which was associated with younger age, female sex and multimorbidity. Significant associations with poor sleep included health/medical factors: COVID-19CEV status, higher BMI, arthritis, pulmonary disease, and mental health disorders;and the following lifestyle and psychosocial factors: living alone, higher alcohol consumption, an unhealthy diet and higher depressive and anxiety symptoms. Moderators of the negative relationship between COVID-19CEV status and good sleep quality were marital status, loneliness, anxiety and diet. Within this subgroup, less anxious and less lonely males, as well as females with healthier diets, reported better sleep. Conclusions: Sleep quality in older adults was compromised during the sudden unprecedented nation-wide lockdown due to distinct modifiable factors. An important contribution of our study is the assessment of a â€œclinically-extremely-vulnerableâ€ population and the sex differences identified within this group. Male and female older adults deemed COVID-19CEV may benefit from targeted mental health and dietary interventions, respectively. This work extends the available evidence on the notable impact of lack of social interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep, and provides recommendations toward areas for future work, including research into vulnerability factors impacting sleep disruption and COVID-19-related complications. Study results may inform tailored interventions targeted at modifiable risk factors to promote optimal sleep;additionally, providing empirical data to support health policy development in this area.

"Using a One Health approach to prioritize zoonotic diseases in China, 2019","BACKGROUND: China is vulnerable to zoonotic disease transmission due to a large agricultural work force, sizable domestic livestock population, and a highly biodiverse ecology. To better address this threat, representatives from the human, animal, and environmental health sectors in China held a One Health Zoonotic Disease Prioritization (OHZDP) workshop in May 2019 to develop a list of priority zoonotic diseases for multisectoral, One Health collaboration. METHODS: Representatives used the OHZDP Process, developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), to prioritize zoonotic diseases for China. Representatives defined the criteria used for prioritization and determined questions and weights for each individual criterion. A review of English and Chinese literature was conducted prior to the workshop to collect disease specific information on prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) from China and the Western Pacific Region for zoonotic diseases considered for prioritization. RESULTS: Thirty zoonotic diseases were evaluated for prioritization. Criteria selected included: 1) disease hazard/severity (case fatality rate) in humans, 2) epidemic scale and intensity (in humans and animals) in China, 3) economic impact, 4) prevention and control, and 5) social impact. Disease specific information was obtained from 792 articles (637 in English and 155 in Chinese) and subject matter experts for the prioritization process. Following discussion of the OHZDP Tool output among disease experts, five priority zoonotic diseases were identified for China: avian influenza, echinococcosis, rabies, plague, and brucellosis. CONCLUSION: Representatives agreed on a list of five priority zoonotic diseases that can serve as a foundation to strengthen One Health collaboration for disease prevention and control in China;this list was developed prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 pandemic. Next steps focused on establishing a multisectoral, One Health coordination mechanism, improving multisectoral linkages in laboratory testing and surveillance platforms, creating multisectoral preparedness and response plans, and increasing workforce capacity.","Wang, X.; Rainey, J.

"Predictors of stress among a sample of Egyptian healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had a tremendous effect on peopleâ€™s mental health. Healthcare workers were on the front lines in response to this crisis;therefore, they were among the most affected by the pandemic. The study aims to assess the stress perceived by healthcare workers and possible factors contributing to it, hoping that more efforts will be exerted to support the well-being of healthcare workers during public health emergencies. A cross-sectional study using an online survey was conducted. Data were collected from 118 healthcare professionals working with COVID-19 patients during the peak of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Most of the respondents (75.2%) scored much higher stress levels than average, and 19.5% had slightly higher levels of stress. Most respondents were afraid of infecting their family and close ones (77.1 %), and about half of the respondents were afraid of getting infected (47.5%). Regression analysis revealed that the only significant independent variable predicting developing higher stress levels among the participants was assigning them to tasks outside their specialty. Conclusions: Healthcare workers are at high risk of developing mental health problems during public health emergencies. Their well-being is essential for the quality of services they provide. More efforts are needed to ensure the well-being of healthcare workers and to prepare them for such emergencies. Preparing healthcare workers before redeployment through training and providing PPEs will help to reduce the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their physical and mental health.

"â€œOne size does not fit allâ€ â€“ lessons learned from a multiple-methods study of a resident wellness curriculum across sites and specialties","Background There is growing recognition that wellness interventions should occur in context and acknowledge complex contributors to wellbeing, including individual needs, institutional and cultural barriers to wellbeing, as well as systems issues which propagate distress. The authors conducted a multiple-methods study exploring contributors to wellbeing for junior residents in diverse medical environments who participated in a brief resilience and stress-reduction curriculum, the Stress Management and Resiliency Training Program for Residents (SMART-R). Methods Using a waitlist-controlled design, the curriculum was implemented for post-graduate year (PGY)-1 or PGY-2 residents in seven residency programs across three sites. Every three months, residents completed surveys, including the Perceived Stress Scale-10, General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire, a mindfulness scale (CAMSR), and a depression screen (PHQ-2). Residents also answered free-text reflection questions about psychological wellbeing and health behaviors. Results The SMART-R intervention was not significantly associated with decreased perceived stress. Linear regression modeling showed that depression was positively correlated with reported stress levels, while male sex and self-efficacy were negatively correlated with stress. Qualitative analysis elucidated differences in these groups: Residents with lower self-efficacy, those with a positive depression screen, and/or female residents were more likely to describe experiencing lack of control over work. Residents with higher self-efficacy described more positive health behaviors. Residents with a positive depression screen were more self-critical, and more likely to describe negative personal life events. Conclusions This curriculum did not significantly modify junior residentsâ€™ stress. Certain subpopulations experienced greater stress than others (female residents, those with lower self-efficacy, and those with a positive depression screen). Qualitative findings from this study highlight universal stressful experiences early in residency, as well as important differences in experience of the learning environment among subgroups. Tailored wellness interventions that aim to support diverse resident sub-groups may be higher yield than a â€œone size fits allâ€ approach.

A quasi-experimental online study on the changeability of stigmatising attitudes and intermediate variables in the process of utilisation","Background Epidemiological studies show that even in highly developed countries many people with depression do not seek help for their mental health issues, despite promising prevention approaches encouraging people to seek help and reduce self-stigma. Therefore, an anti-stigma intervention study to support help-seeking behaviour will be developed on the basis of the newly explicated â€œSeeking Mental Health Care Modelâ€. Methods A quasi-experimental online study will be carried out to assess the effect of different intervention variables relevant for the help-seeking process. The study is conceived as a fractional factorial design. Participants will be screened for depressive complaints (PHQ-9 sum score = 8) and current psychiatric/psychotherapeutic treatment. After baseline assessment the participants will be randomly allocated into one of the 24 study groups receiving different combinations of the vignette-based intervention aiming to reduce stigma and support help-seeking. Next, relevant outcome measures will be administered a second time. In a 3- and 6-month follow-up help-seeking behaviour will be measured. Gamified elements and avatar-choice techniques will be used to heighten study immersion and adherence. Discussion On the basis of the project results, promising research and intervention perspectives can be developed. Results, firstly, allow for a more detailed empirical investigation and conceptualisation of the stages of mental health care utilisation, as well as an examination of theoretical approaches to stigmatisation. Secondly, our online study could provide insights for an evidence-based design and evaluation of online interventions for people with a mental illness.

"Effect of medication therapy combined with transcranial direct current stimulation on depression and response inhibition of patients with bipolar disorder type I: a clinical trial","Objective Bipolar Disorder (BD) is one of the most common mental disorders associated with depressive symptoms and impairment in executive functions such as response inhibition. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of medication therapy combined with Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) on depression and response inhibition of patients with BD. Method This is a double-blinded randomized clinical trial with pretest, posttest, and follow-up design. Participants were 30 patients with BD randomly assigned to two groups of Medication+tDCS (n = 15, receiving medications plus tDCS with 2 mA intensity over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 10 days, two sessions per day each for 20 min) and Medication (n = 15, receiving mood stabilizers including 2â€“5 tables of 300 mg (mg) lithium, 200 mg sodium valproate, and 200 mg carbamazepine two times per day). Pretest, posttest and 3-month follow-up assessments were the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and a Go/No-Go test. Collected data were analyzed in SPSS v.20 software. Results The mean HDRS score in both groups was reduced after both interventional techniques, where the group received combined therapy showed more reduction (P &lt; 0.01), although their effects were not maintained after 3 months. In examining response inhibition variable, only the combined therapy could reduce the commission error of patients under a go/no-go task (p &lt; 0.05), but its effect was not maintained after 3 months. There was no significant difference in the group received medication therapy alone. Conclusion Medication in combination with tDCS can reduce the depressive symptoms and improve the response inhibition ability of people with BD.

"How has COVID-19 impacted the civil registration and vital statistics system in Loreto, PerÃº? Evidence using process mapping and qualitative analysis","OBJECTIVES: Accurate civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems are the primary data source to measure the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality. This study assesses how the pandemic impacted CRVS system processes in Loreto region of Peru, one of the worst affected countries globally. DESIGN: Qualitative study. SETTING: Loreto, a remote region, which had the highest reported mortality rate in Peru during the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: Semistructured individual interviews and documentary analysis were conducted between September 2020 and May 2021 with 28 key informants from eight institutions involved in death certification. Key informants were identified using a purposive sampling strategy commencing at the Health Directorate of Loreto, and the snowball method was used where a participant suggested another organisation or person. Information from key informants was used to compare business process maps of the CRVS system before and during the pandemic. RESULTS: During early May 2020, there were seven times more registered deaths than in earlier years, but key informants believed this underestimated mortality by 20%-30%. During the pandemic, families had to interact with more institutions during the death certification process. Several issues disrupted death certification processes, including the burden of increased deaths, the Environmental Health Directorate often removing a body without the family's express agreement, the creation of COVID-19 cemeteries where no death certificate was needed for burial, greater participation of funeral homes that often used outdated paper forms, and closure of civil registry offices. There was increased use of the online National Death System (SINADEF) but many users had problems with access. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic substantially disrupted CRVS processes in Loreto, making death certification more difficult, placing greater burden on the family and leading to more participation from unregulated organisations such as funeral homes or cemeteries. These disruptions were impacted by limitations of the CRVS system's processes before the pandemic.","Silva-Valencia, J.; Adair, T.; Hart, J.; Meza, G.; Vargas Herrera, J.","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055024","","Database: PubMed; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(11):e055024, 2021.; Publication details: BMJ Open; 11(11):e055024, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22694,""
"Heard, valued, supported? Doctors' wellbeing during transitions triggered by COVID-19","CONTEXT: Supporting doctors' wellbeing is crucial for medical education to help minimise negative long-term impacts on medical workforce retention and ultimately patient care. There is limited study of how doctors' transitions experiences impact wellbeing, particularly socially and culturally. Multiple Multidimensional Transitions (MMT) theory views transitions as dynamic, incorporating multiple contexts and multiple domains. Using MMT as our lens, we report a qualitative analysis of how transitions experienced by doctors during the pandemic impacted on social and cultural aspects of wellbeing. METHODS: Longitudinal narrative inquiry was employed, using interviews and audio-diaries. Data were collected over six months in three phases: (1) interviews with doctors from across the career spectrum (n=98);(2) longitudinal audio-diaries for 2-4 months (n=71);(3) second interviews (n=83). Data were analysed abductively, narrowing focus to factors important to social and cultural wellbeing. FINDINGS: Doctors described experiencing multiple interacting transitions triggered by the pandemic in multiple contexts (workplace, role, homelife, education). Patterns identifiable across the dataset allowed us to explore social and cultural wellbeing crosscutting beyond individual experience. Three critical factors contributed to social and cultural wellbeing both positively and negatively: being heard (e.g. by colleagues asking how they are);being valued (e.g. removal of rest spaces by organisations showing lack of value);and being supported (e.g. through regular briefing by education bodies). CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to longitudinally explore the multiple-multidimensional transitions experienced by doctors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our data analysis helped us move beyond existing perceptions around wellbeing and articulate multiple factors that contribute to social and cultural wellbeing. It is vital that medical educators consider the learning from these experiences to help pinpoint what aspects of support might be beneficial to trainee doctors and their trainers. This study forms the basis for developing evidenced-based interventions that ensure doctors are heard, valued and supported.","Gordon, L.; Scanlan, G. M.; Tooman, T. R.; Walker, K.

"Mental health and COVID-19 perceptions in a predominant black population in the Eastern Caribbean: an exploratory study of residents of Barbados","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine the mental health challenges of residents of Barbados during the COVID-19 pandemic and the relationships between residentsâ€™ demographics, COVID-19 perceptions and mental health outcomes. Design/methodology/approach: The study surveyed 450 predominantly Black Caribbean respondents to examine their mental ill-health on the various dimensions of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-28 measure and the relationships with demographics and COVID-19 perceptions. Findings: Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the four-factor model solution of GHQ-28 over the single factor solution. Barbadians were generally mild in their mental ill-health on the somatic symptoms, social dysfunction and severe depression dimensions but were at least moderately strained on the anxiety and insomnia dimensions. Younger and unemployed Barbadian respondents reported more adverse mental health outcomes, and perceived severity of COVID-19 infection significantly predicted three of the four dimensions of mental distress (excluding severe depression). Research limitations/implications: The study used a cross-sectional self-report survey research design which does not permit causal inferences. Further research is advised to ascertain the longitudinal effects of COVID-19 perceptions over time on mental health outcomes. Practical implications: The studyâ€™s findings suggest the need for nation-wide, multi-stakeholder interventions or approaches in responding mental health challenges of the population during this crisis. Originality/value: The study was the first to examine the mental health outcomes, using GHQ-28, in a small Caribbean country â€“ which represents an underserved space in mental health research. It is the first to empirically examine the relationship between COVID-19 perceptions of Afro-Caribbean people in this region and their resultant mental health outcomes.

"Exploring the professional experiences of mental health occupational therapists during a period of COVID-19","Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about disruption in the way health-care professionals carry out their day-to-day practices across communities. The purpose of this research paper is to explore the professional experiences of occupational therapists working in community and rehabilitation mental health settings during a period of the COVID-19 pandemic and to help gain an understanding of how their day-to-day work practices have been affected. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative phenomenological research study explored the lived experiences of ten occupational therapists working within Health Service Executive community and rehabilitation mental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included eight community mental health occupational therapists and two rehabilitative mental health occupational therapists. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. Findings: Three themes were identified: holding on to what we do;technology: friend and foe;and COVID as a catalyst to clarify the occupational therapy role. These themes capture the community changes, challenges and frustrations experienced by the occupational therapists while striving to provide quality mental health occupational therapy services during the pandemic. Originality/value: The findings demonstrate the adaptive nature of the profession, the importance of traditional observation methods of community-based care, the experiences with telehealth approaches and an opportunity to clarify misconceptions of aspects of the professionâ€™s role in relation to employment-related issues and occupational therapy group work within such mental health settings.

"Social Determinants and Health Behaviours among Older Adults Experiencing Multimorbidity Using the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging","This study examines associations between lifestyle behavioural factors and appraisals of ""healthy aging""among older adults experiencing multimorbidity. A Social Determinants and Health Behaviour Model (SDHBM) is used to frame the analyses. Using baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), we studied 12,272 Canadians 65 years of age or older who reported 2 or more of 27 chronic conditions. Additional analyses were conducted using three multimorbidity clusters: cardiovascular/metabolic, musculoskeletal, and mental health. Using hierarchical logistic regression, it was found that, for multmorbidity and the three illness clusters, healthy aging is consistently associated with not smoking (except for the mental health cluster), an absence of obesity (except for the cardiovascular and metabolic cluster), better sleep, and a better appetite. It is not associated with inactivity. Several socio-demographic, environmental, and illness covariates were also supported. The findings are examined using the SDHBM coupled with a resilience lens in order to elucidate how modifiable health behaviours can act as resources to mitigate multimorbidity adversities. This has implications for healthy aging for persons with multimorbidity, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"One-year mental health outcomes in a cohort of COVID-19 survivors","COVID-19 survivors are at increased risk of persistent psychopathology after the infection. Despite long-term sequelae are an increasing concern, long-term neuropsychiatric consequences remain largely unclear. This cohort study aimed at investigating the psychopathological impact of COVID-19 in Italy one year after infection, outlining the trajectory of symptomatology at one, six-, and twelve-months follow-up. We evaluated 402, 216, and 192 COVID-19 survivors respectively at one, six, and 12 months. A subgroup of 95 patients was evaluated longitudinally both at one, six, and 12 months. Validated self-report questionnaires were administered to assess depression, fatigue, anxiety, and post-traumatic distress. Socio-demographics and setting of care information were gathered for each participant. At six and twelve months, respectively 94 (44%) and 86 (45%) patients self-rated in the clinical range in at least one psychopathological dimension. Pathological fatigue at twelve months was detected in 63 patients (33%). Considering the longitudinal cohort an interaction effect of sex and time was observed for depression (FÂ =Â 8.63, pÂ &lt;Â 0.001) and anxiety (FÂ =Â 5.42, pÂ =Â 0.005) with males showing a significant increasing trend of symptoms, whereas an opposite course was observed in females. High prevalence of psychiatric sequelae six and 12 months after COVID-19 was reported for the first time.

"Client perspectives on the accessibility and quality of substance use treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background People who use drugs have been particularly vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic because of their unique social, harm reduction, and treatment needs. These unique needs and challenges have significant influence on the severity of their substance use, mental health symptomatology, willingness to engage in treatment, and adherence to treatment options. This has included immense challenges related to the dissemination of COVID-19 messaging and the need for harm reduction and treatment service entities to adopt new formats to continue operation. Methods In-depth interview data were collected people who use drugs (N=24) residing in Oklahoma from November 2020 through February 2021 to assess perspectives on (1) their access to harm reduction, substance use prevention, and treatment programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the perceived quality of such services and programs during this time, and (3) the perceived availability of tailored COVID-19 information. Results Several factors emerged related to accessing and quality of substance use services during COVID-19, including poor accessibility (e.g., internet access), diminished quality (i.e., lack of social support), and lack of tailored COVID-19 prevention and treatment messaging. Conclusions Upticks in COVID-19 cases and deaths are expected to continue as new SARS-CoV-2 variants are introduced. The present findings highlight the need for tailored COVID-19 messaging (e.g., minimizing the sharing of substance use supplies that can spread COVID-19, mask wearing, COVID-19 vaccination), which is responsive to unique needs of substance using populations. Similarly, as prevention and treatment programs are delivered online, efforts are necessary to ensure equitable access and enhanced quality of services.","Hubach, Randolph D.; O'Neil, Andrew M.; Ernst, Campbell, Stowe, Mollie, Hickey, Mark, Remondino, Molly, Giano, Zachary","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dadr.2021.100002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports; 1:100002, 2021.; Publication details: Drug and Alcohol Dependence Reports; 1:100002, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22702,""
"Mental Health Concerns, Insomnia, and Loneliness Among Intern Doctors Amidst the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from a Large Tertiary Care Hospital in Bangladesh","Precisely how intern doctors (or trainee physicians) have been impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic is currently poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate the mental health consequences (i.e., depression, anxiety, and stress), insomnia, and loneliness among intern doctors in Bangladesh amidst the pandemic. A cross-sectional offline survey of 108 intern doctors (53.7 % female;mean age = 24.80 Â± 1.08;age range = 23â€“29 years) in a large tertiary care hospital in Bangladesh was conducted. The participants were surveyed randomly from respective wards during their duties with an anonymous and self-reported questionnaire assessing socio-demographics, COVID-19-related consideration, mental health, insomnia, loneliness, and other measures. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine relationships. The prevalence estimates of mild to extremely severe depression, anxiety, and stress were 53.7 %, 63.9 %, and 38.9 %, respectively. Sub-threshold to severe insomnia was acknowledged by 53.7 % and loneliness by 43.5 %. Depression was associated with not receiving mental health counseling during the pandemic, anxiety, stress, and loneliness;anxiety was associated with depression and stress;stress was associated with depression, anxiety, and loneliness;insomnia was associated with being married;and loneliness was associated with poorer quality of life, depression, and stress. Depression, but not anxiety and insomnia, fully mediated the relationship between loneliness and regret regarding choice of profession because of the pandemic and its many unexpected experiences. The findings showed considerable mental health concerns, insomnia, and loneliness among intern doctors in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should further explore the role of mental health concerns in healthcare providers and perceptions of their profession during the pandemic, and examine interventions to help this vulnerable population.

"Achieving Sustainability Goals Through Infrastructure Modifications: Lessons Learnt from COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 was declared as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020 by the World Health Organization, but the world is already going after it. From China, cases spread rapidly across the world, driving world policymakersâ€™ stringent steps to separate cases and restrict the virus transmission. The main supportive foundations of the modern world economies have been torn up by these strategies as multinational trading and collaboration resulted in nationalizing and fighting for limited stocks. The epidemic in COVID-19 greatly influenced the growth of infrastructure and the global economy. Global reactions are underway to rapid disruptions in main markets and industries in infrastructure. One remedy is to return to the physical and building environment (BE) to reduce the effect before medications for an outbreak are created. Due to the fear of illness, epidemics have changed our world. In several past studies of infectious pandemics, advances in the BE have been seen to help more to deter infection transmission. Architecture and urbanism would also never be the same following the COVID-19 outbreak. In encouraging environmental health interventions and reducing chances of diseases, BE has an important role to play. Although the ongoing worldwide outbreak is a threat at all levels of the developed environment, implementing an antivirus paradigm can take time to minimize future threats or deter the virus from spreading. This paper presents how the world produced by virus looks on the basis of the lessons learned and the value of a stable and safe environment. Many questions unanswered need further multidisciplinary research. This paper looks at the future COVID-19 steps to gradual and systemic improvements in varying time frames and sizes, which enhance air quality and less energy use, or the use of materials that eventually fulfil the sustainability objectives. This challenges us to reconsider buildings and urban areas and eventually use sustainable solutions for winâ€“win results.

"Anxiety sensitivity mediates relations between anxiety (but not depression) and problematic smartphone use severity, adjusting for age and sex, in Chinese adolescents early in the COVID-19 pandemic","Risk factors for problematic smartphone use (PSU) have rapidly become an important area of research due to the prevalence of smartphones and functional impairment associated with PSU. Our aim was to examine relations between established predictors of PSU (depression and anxiety) and a potential mediator of PSU (anxiety sensitivity;AS). Participants (NÂ = 4752) from junior and senior high schools in Tianjin, China completed a web-based survey with measures of depression, anxiety, AS, and PSU. Descriptive and inferential analyses revealed significant differences between males and females on depression severity, and between junior and senior high school students on AS and PSU severity. Results of structural equation modeling indicated that anxiety was positively associated with AS when adjusting for depression;and AS was significantly associated with greater PSU severity, adjusting for age and sex. Additionally, AS mediated relations between anxiety and PSU severity. Current findings on AS are consistent with theoretical models of problematic internet use (Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution) and previous research linking AS to other kinds of behavioral addictions (e.g., smoking, alcohol use).

"STUDENT'S MENTAL HEALTH IN PANDEMIC COVID-19: AN EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE","Mental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being. Occasionally, the term of mental health is used to refer to the absence of a mental illness. Mental health or sanity refers to an individual's social well-being, thoughts, and emotions. The outbreak of COVID-19 and the widespread transmission of the virus in Malaysia have deteriorated the mental health of students at UiTM East Coast in terms of family, financial, and campus relocation. The purpose of this study is to determine how family, financial, and campus relocation affect student's mental health during a pandemic on the UiTM East Coast. The findings indicate that family, financial, and campus migration all has a strong correlation with student's mental health. Additionally, the study's findings established that family, financial, and campus migration was all strongly associated with student's mental health. Additionally, the data demonstrate that family and finance have a beneficial effect on student's mental health. Meanwhile, campus relocation has the most beneficial effect on student's mental health. We can conclude from these findings that family, financial, and campus relocation have had a substantial impact on student's mental health.","Omar, Siti Nur Zahirah, Bakar, Azizi Abu, Wae-esor, Emeela, Othman, Muhammad Firdaus","https://www.google.com/search?q=STUDENT'S+MENTAL+HEALTH+IN+PANDEMIC+COVID-19:+AN+EMPIRICAL+EVIDENCE","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Academy of Strategic Management Journal; 20:1-7, 2021.; Publication details: Academy of Strategic Management Journal; 20:1-7, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22708,""

"Evaluation of Mental Health Effects of a Mindfulness Workshop with Health Professions Students","Our interprofessional team examined the mental health effects of a pilot mindfulness meditation workshop for college students (n = 39) from 4 health professions. A mixed-methods survey examined students' self-compassion (short form;SCS-sf), perceived stress (PSS-10), and self-reported mindfulness behaviors pre-workshop and at 2 months. The survey captured attitudes, beliefs, and intentions to continue mindfulness practices over time and perceived barriers to mindfulness practice. Participants (69%;27/39) indicated significantly improved SCS-sf (p=0.016) and significantly reduced PSS (p=0.009) at 2 months post-workshop. Students reported improved mental health after 2 months, but the small sample size limits generalizability of findings.

"The history of pandemics and evolution so far","In the realm of infectious diseases, a pandemic is the worst-case scenario. When an epidemic is spread beyond a country's borders, then it is officially called pandemic. Humankind has always seen communicable diseases, but shift to aggregarion life made epidemic and later pandemic more possible. Malaria, tuberculosis, leprosy, influenzae [1, 2], and smallpox were some of them. The more civilized humans became, the more likely the pandemics became - like the first cholera pandemic in 1817 originated in Russia. In recent history, the world's one of the deadliest pandemics in 1918 was Spanish flu which struck 50 million deaths in Europe, USA, and parts of Asia. In 1981 AIDS, and then the world witnessed SARS- CoV-1 in 2003 in China, a form of coronavirus, a name which helps us recognize this new one of the most contagious pandemics the world has ever witnessed, called SARS-CoV-2 or popularly called COVID-19 or, as some say, Wuhan virus. SARS-CoV-2 was reported by China in late December 2019 with pneumonia-like symptoms of unknown origin. Without a vaccine available, it spread beyond borders, to more than 163 countries. COVID-19 has revealed vulnerabilities in the global communities' response to outbreaks of viruses, which has damaged the world's economy to the worst recession since the Great Depression. Shift of power and bringing the world to a standstill is something which none has ever imagined. Deaths, broken families, helplessness, fear and anxiety, uncertainty, and many more emotions were heaped on mankind. Economies suffered but the planet breathed, humans stopped but wildlife played. Life under COVID-19 brought blue skies and clean air, and many suffered but then many held them. Humans sought to learn and strive, sufferings created fighters, roadblocks paved new paths, and this horrendous experience changed the outlook and paved the perspective for a new world after COVID-19.

"Feelings of adolescents facing social isolation due to COVID-19 from the phenomenological methodology","Introduction: Confinement due to COVID-19 has affected various groups of people, one of them is adolescents, who have experienced positive and negative feelings. Objective: To describe the feelings experienced by adolescents in the face of social isolation due to COVID-19 in Amazonas, Peru. Methods: Qualitative study of social phenomenological methodological approach by Alfred SchÃ¼tz;the setting was the housing of adolescents in the Amazon Region-Peru, during the month of June 2020. The sample was 22 adolescents with family ties of nursing students, whose ages fluctuate from 12 to 17 years, of both sexes, Selected by saturation of speeches, the data collection technique was the phenomenological interview and the instrument was an interview guide, the recorded information was collected through video calls on WhatsApp and Google Meet, with prior assent and informed consent. Idiographic and nomothetic anÃ¡lisis was used. Results: 4 categories emerged: ""Boredom and monotony"", ""Academic stress due to virtual classes and homework overload"", ""Sadness due to death and fear of contagion"", ""Happiness for sharing family moments at home"". Conclusions: Adolescents express feelings of boredom for not following their daily routine, but they feel joy when being with their family and sharing moments to talk, enjoy food and have fun through games, unusual aspects when parents work outside the home or because teenagers are with their peers. These contributions allow reflection on the role of school nursing in educational institutions. Â© 2020, Editorial Ciencias Medicas. All rights reserved.","Gutierrez, S. C. H.; MuÃ±oz, S.

"Meeting the Educational Needs of Oncology Navigators to Navigate the Complexities of the Cancer Care Continuum via Virtual Format","Background: The Academy of Oncology Nurse & Patient Navigators conducted a 4-day virtual, live-streamed conference that provided a forum for dialogue among participating navigators who provide navigation survivorship care services for oncology patients. General sessions and breakout meetings fostered discussion regarding the complexities of the cancer care continuum, financial considerations, access to screening and treatment, the impact of personalized care, psychosocial considerations, and the challenges of various healthcare delivery models. A literature review showed that the high interactivity and networking in virtual learning creates an effective learning environment.1,2 Learning Objectives: Upon completion of the 2021 educational activity, participants were expected to be able to: * Describe the role of navigators in supporting personalized cancer care * Evaluate best practices in building an oncology navigator program * Define the role of navigators in advising cancer patients on COVID screening * Incorporate information regarding various navigation models and best practices to improve the quality of cancer patient care * Describe best practices in financial navigation for cancer patients and their caregivers Methods: To gauge the audience's understanding of navigation, they were surveyed about their years of experience and awareness of navigation performance improvement initiatives and the associations between cancer and mental health. Changes in audience knowledge and competencies were evaluated using a pre- and postactivity survey and a 3-month follow-up survey on self-reported practice changes. Results: The meeting was attended by 235 practitioners from 40 states. Sixty-three percent were practicing in community settings, and 92% of attendees were nurse navigators. Fifty-four percent of practitioners completing the survey stated they had worked with oncology patients in their present position for 0 to 5 years. In a presurvey, 63% of attendees stated they were very familiar or familiar with the role of the navigator in performance improvement initiatives, and 72% of attendees were confident in their familiarity with the associations between cancer and mental health. As a result of their participation in this activity and interacting with other participants in the chat mode, 100% of the participants strongly agreed or agreed that they were better able to meet the learning objectives of the conference. On the 3-month follow-up, 67% stated they had made changes to their practice because of their participation in the conference, with the focus of change centered around patient education (39%), documentation (24%), and treatment approach (17%). Conclusions: As evidence in the literature demonstrates that virtual learning creates effective learning environments, this format enables all levels of personnel to interact, share best practices, build professional confidence, and learn care strategies that can result in changes to their current practice. Oncology navigation continues to grow as a field, and virtual learning environments will help foster its ongoing development.","Gentry, Sharon, Gentry, Emily, Dean, Monica","https://www.google.com/search?q=Meeting+the+Educational+Needs+of+Oncology+Navigators+to+Navigate+the+Complexities+of+the+Cancer+Care+Continuum+via+Virtual+Format","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Journal of Oncology Navigation & Survivorship; 12(11):405-406, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Oncology Navigation & Survivorship; 12(11):405-406, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22713,""
"Implementation of Remote Supportive Care Programs to Women at Risk for and Surviving with Breast and Ovarian Cancer During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 global pandemic created significant challenges in providing screening, treatment, and support services to women at risk for and living with breast and ovarian cancer. These individuals have unique socio-emotional needs (eg, stress, fear of recurrence, caregiving, employment, financial hardship) that preceded the pandemic and intensified during COVID-19. Sharsheret, a national nonprofit organization helping Jewish women with breast and ovarian cancer, provides informative and supportive programming to address these needs. In response to the pandemic, the organization implemented a range of programs specifically designed for this population during a time of crisis. Objectives: To describe the psychosocial care needs of women impacted by breast and ovarian cancer, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of resources to meet these needs. Methods: Outcome data from 345 respondents were collected in early 2021, including data from a special COVID-19 impact survey evaluating remote programs offered during the pandemic. Results: Among respondents, 19% were most concerned about financial hardship during the pandemic due to loss of/changes in employment, insurance, or other income;16% also expressed concern about obtaining care and support. Respondents expressed high satisfaction with the programs and services offered, as 64% highly valued online educational webinars, and 51% valued experiential workshops and essential connections with Sharsheret's clinical staff. The implementation of such programs supported women in maintaining their physical health, mental health, and overall well-being in the midst of a global pandemic. Conclusion: Success of these remote care services offered during COVID-19 highlights the necessity of implementing opportunities for continued psychosocial programming. Insights gleaned from this evaluation serve to inform on how to best educate and counsel women at risk for and surviving with breast and ovarian cancer during times of crisis.","Fleischmann, Adina, Silber, Elana, Rosen, Melissa, Campbell, Sydney, Marku, Nikoleta, Dunn, Catherine, Lobo, Tania, Tercyak, Kenneth P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Implementation+of+Remote+Supportive+Care+Programs+to+Women+at+Risk+for+and+Surviving+with+Breast+and+Ovarian+Cancer+During+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Journal of Oncology Navigation & Survivorship; 12(11):402-403, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Oncology Navigation & Survivorship; 12(11):402-403, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22714,""
"""Helping the Helpers"": The Impact of COVID-19 on Work and Home Stress for Oncology Professionals","Background: The Cancer Support Community (CSC) is a leader in providing psychosocial care and has recognized the importance of understanding the effects of COVID-19 on healthcare professionals and addressing gaps in identified supports. Recent national US surveys have found a 45% burnout prevalence rate among oncologists, while other global studies have suggested burnout rates in oncologists ranging from 20% to 70%. In October 2020, a survey was disseminated to a wide range of oncology professionals to understand the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on work and home life, including stressors related to burnout and other challenges such as compassion fatigue. Objective: To understand the stressors related to burnout and other challenges, such as compassion fatigue, is highly relevant as it affects personal well-being and quality of life of the healthcare professional. Currently no research exists regarding the impact of COVID-19 on work and home stress among oncology helping professionals. Methods: CSC disseminated an anonymous survey throughout its affiliate network, Healthcare Partners, and the larger oncology community. The target audience of oncology helping professionals included physicians, social workers, nurses, physician's assistants, psychologists, and other mental health professionals. There were 3 parts to this survey: (1) demographic questions, (2) the Professional Quality of Life Scale, and (3) an open-ended response to stressors experienced at work and at home due to COVID-19. Results: Eighty-six individuals participated in the survey. Results from this study indicate moderate levels of compassion satisfaction (M = 40.4, SD = 5.9), burnout (M = 24, SD = 6.7), and secondary traumatic stress (M = 22.9, SD = 6.4) among respondents. Bivariate analyses indicated nonwhite oncology professionals reported lower compassion satisfaction compared with whites, and hospital workers reported higher levels of burnout compared with staff in nonhospital settings. The most common stressors that oncology professionals reported experiencing at work due to COVID-19 included the primary themes of workplace issues (eg, less in-person contact), patient care (eg, increased patient needs/distress), and health (eg, concern for personal or family health/fear of COVID-19). The most common stressors that respondents reported experiencing at home due to COVID-19 also included 3 primary themes: health (eg, isolation/loneliness), family and children (eg, online school/homeschooling), and financial (eg, job insecurity). Conclusion: Survey results underscore the stress of COVID-19 on oncology professionals and the unique impact the pandemic has had on work and home-life stressors in this population. Survey results can be used as an important tool to identify support gaps and create target resources, as well as serve as a base for future research.","Downey, Kara, Ash-Lee, Susan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Helping+the+Helpers:+The+Impact+of+COVID-19+on+Work+and+Home+Stress+for+Oncology+Professionals","","Database: CINAHL; Publication details: Journal of Oncology Navigation & Survivorship; 12(11):401-402, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Oncology Navigation & Survivorship; 12(11):401-402, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22715,""

"Teleworking in times of COVID-19","One of the impacts that COVID-19 has brought has been social isolation and teleworking. In this sense, telework presents different conditions to traditional ways of working from home, since in these conditions due to the COVI-19, there has been an increase in insecurity, fear and uncertainty. This study analyzes the characteristics of telework and its impact on productivity and well-being in people. The study was carried out in Ecuador, in a sample of 459 people who answered an online questionnaire. The results found demonstrate that there are aspects that affect productivity such as working long hours, personal skills, specifically self-motivation and organizational skills, and mental health. With this research, a better understanding of the situation of teleworking in confinement due to COVID-19 is achieved, allowing both individuals and organizations to develop resources so that work from home is successful and people feel satisfied while this situation lasts.

"Impact of psychosocial stressors on emotional and behavioral problems in Chinese adolescents during the COVID-19 period: the explanatory value of loneliness","Background: Chinese adolescents experienced a variety of stressors during the COVID-19 home confinement period. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of emotional and behavioral problems (EBPs) among adolescents during the COVID-19 period. The study also examined the relationships between psychosocial stressors and adolescents' EBPs, and explored the potential explanatory value of loneliness for any associations observed. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study which included 6,587 adolescents in Taizhou, China between April 16 and May 14, 2020. Adolescents' EBPs were assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), while subjective feelings of loneliness were assessed using one item from the Children's Depression Inventory. We applied structural equation modelling to assess direct and indirect associations (explained by loneliness) between psychosocial stressors (study problems, parent-child relationship, and family or friends with COVID-19) and the total difficulties and prosocial scores. Results: The prevalence of EBPs in the sample was 31.6% for total difficulties and 37.5% for prosocial problems. After adjustment for a range of covariates, the presence of study problems, poor parent-child relationship and family or friends with COVID-19 were significantly associated with a higher SDQ total difficulties score (beta=6.20, 21.46, 5.21;P&lt;0.01) and a lower prosocial score (beta=-0.79, -4.35, -1.65;P&lt;0.01). There was an explanatory effect of loneliness on these associations, which explained 27-37% of the total effect on the total difficulties score and 11-37% on the prosocial score. Conclusions: The presence of psychosocial stressors during the home confinement period was related to higher EBPs in adolescents, and the relationship was partially explained by loneliness. Targeted psychosocial interventions towards loneliness and COVID-19 related stressors may improve adolescents' psychological health.","Wang, J. Y.; Yang, Y.; Lin, H. J.; Richards, M.; Yang, S.

Material and Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE 8: COVID-19 Survey). We selected a sample of 1080 noninstitutional Portuguese individuals aged = 60 years. Results: The study sample consisted of 605 (56%) women and 475 (44%) men, with a mean age of 70 +/- 9.1 years. In total, 80% of the participants experienced higher levels of anxiety, 73% felt more depressed and 30% experienced additional sleep problems compared to the period before the pandemic. Interestingly, there were no statistically significant differences between the sexes or the two selected age groups (60 - 74 and over 75 years old) regarding the incidence of these changes. Only 23%, of those that were interviewed maintained their walking routines. In addition, only 8% of the participants continued visiting family members as frequently as before. While 8% of the participants were refused some form of medical treatment, 56% claimed that they experienced healthcare delays. However, only 15% of the participants reported that their health status worsened during the pandemic. Discussion: The pandemic has had a significant impact on Portuguese individuals aged &gt;= 60 years;which is in agreement with the findings of previous international studies. It changed the participants' routines and increased their anxiety and depression levels. Despite the deterioration of healthcare services, most participants did not experience worsening of their health status. Conclusion: In conclusion, a COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the elderly population, particularly regarding their mental health.","Novais, F.; Cordeiro, C.; Camara Pestana, P.; Corte-Real, B.; Reynolds Sousa, T.; Delerue Matos, A.; Telles-Correia, D.","https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.16209","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Acta Medica Portuguesa; 34(11):761-766, 2021.; Publication details: Acta Medica Portuguesa; 34(11):761-766, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22720,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on five Latin American countries","Introduction: Social distancing and quarantine have proven to have negative effects on the mental health of populations, namely fear, anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Resilience emerges as a buffering variable for such impact. The objective of this study was to compare the psychological impact of COVID-19 in several Latin American countries. Method: a sample of 1184 participants from Mexico, Cuba, Chile, Colombia and Guatemala was obtained;whose age ranged from 18 to 83 years old (M = 38.78, SD = 13.81). A survey on medical symptoms associated with COVID-19 and three instruments to evaluate: (1) depression, anxiety and stress, (2) impact of the event and (3) resilience were administered. Results: Younger people, with more symptoms associated with COVID-19 and those who reported higher scores of impact of event tended to present greater depressive, anxious and stress symptomatology. The impact of the event was the most determinant predictor. Resilience was protective against the impact of event, depression, anxiety and stress. Conclusions: The results show the differences in the psychological response to COVID-19 in each country and suggesting the need to develop public policies focused on prevention and promotion of integral health when facing sanitary emergencies.

"Buffering effect of e-learning on Generation Z undergraduate students: A cross-sectional study during the second COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","Background: The massive adoption of e-learning in academic education during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic may be beneficial to digitally skilled individuals, such as Generation Z (Gen Z) members. However, some studies have underscored its negative psychological impact on the mental health of the young adults. We aimed to examine the psychological impact of prolonged e-learning on emotional adaptation among undergraduate students. A secondary objective was to identify key components for preventive interventions targeted toward the academic community by investigating the buffering effect of e-leaning on the impact of negative life events experienced during the pandemic. Methods: The participants were 529 Italian undergraduate students aged 18-26 years. We administered measures of personality traits, anxiety symptoms, peritraumatic dissociation, stress, and affinity for e-learning. This study examined emotional adaptation among Gen Z members who were subjected to prolonged academic e-learning during the 2nd COVID-19 lockdown in Italy. Results: Dysfunctional anxiety was not a major issue among our participants. This is indicative of the adoption of effective anxiety management skills during the pandemic. Nevertheless, the findings also underscored the vulnerability of the Gen Z population. Further, coronavirus anxiety significantly predicted mental health through the mediating effect of personality traits. Conclusions: Therefore, health care professionals should design and implement interventions and programmes that focus on coronavirus anxiety and psychological distress.","Ranieri, J.; Guerra, F.; Cilli, E.; Caiazza, I.; Gentili, N.; Ripani, B.; Canzio, M.; Coletti, E.; Quassoni, A.; Niutta, S.; Colicchia, L.; D'Alfonso, S.; Di Giacomo, D.","https://doi.org/10.13129/2282-1619/mjcp-3051","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology; 9(2):17, 2021.; Publication details: Mediterranean Journal of Clinical Psychology; 9(2):17, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22722,""
"The impact of clinical and psychological characteristics on alexithymia in type 1 diabetes","Background: Alexithymia is a psychological construct characterized by inability to express emotions, poor imagination and operational thinking. It is well known its association with several chronic disease such as Diabetes type 2, little is known about diabetes type 1. We examined the association of alexithymia with clinical and psychological outcomes in subjects with type 1 diabetes. Methods: The study was conducted in a single diabetes center. The patients fully completed a protocol composed of the following instruments: the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y (STAI-Y), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD). TAS-20 scores were subdivided into tertiles, Correlations and two linear regression analyses, adjusted for only clinical and clinical plus psychological characteristics, were performed. Overall, 75 patients were enrolled (mean age 41.0 +/- 11.4 years, diabetes duration 19.9 +/- 11.9 years, 49.3% males, 30.7% treated with CSII). Results: People with diabetes of the upper TAS-20 tertile had the greatest rate of depression (with the highest degree of severity) and the higher levels of anger and anxiety. There was a significant correlation between TAS- 20 scores with BMI (r=0.26;p=0.03), HAMD (r=0.38;p=0.001), STAXI-2 (r=0.34;p=0.003) and STAI-Y (r=0.48;p&lt;0.0001). Further regression analysis showed TAS-20 scores were associated with BMI (beta=0.29;p=0.02). The association with BMI was confirmed (beta=0.28;p=0.007) when psychological variables are considered;furthermore, a strong association with STAI-2 (beta=0.48;p&lt;0.0001) was detected, while the analysis did reveal any significant correlation between alexithymia and HbA1c levels. Conclusions: Alexithymia is strongly associated both with clinical and psychological characteristics, notably with BMI and anxiety traits. People with diabetes type 1 should be assessed for alexithymia. Future studies on the current topic are therefore required in order to elucidate the role of alexithymia in diabetes type 1. We believe that patients with diabetes and alexithymia could take advantage of psychological counseling.","Pintaudi, B.; Di Vieste, G.; Nicolucci, A.; Bruno, A.; Genovese, G.; Muscatello, M. R.

"Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders among Antenatal Women in a Rural Area Adjacent to Chennai","Aim: Antenatal anxiety and depression are major health problems all over the world. Research conducted during pandemics found that pregnant women are more vulnerable psychologically. The aim of the study is to estimate the prevalence of anxiety level during the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant women Study Design: A Cross sectional study design Place and Duration of Study: was done on pregnant women attending the antenatal clinic at the rural area adjacent to Chennai, India between april 2021 to October 2021. Methadology: This study was conducted among 74 pregnant women coming for antenatal checkups in the Rural area adjacent to Chennai. Hamilton - Anxiety Scale (HAM-A) was applied after initial psychiatry work up to all women who were selected for the interview. The statistically significant P value was &lt; 0.05. Results: The sociodemographic variables have been found as significant contributors in explaining the variability of the prevalence rates of antenatal depression. According to the findings, less than 1/3rd of pregnant women experience depression as a result of life circumstances such as economic crises in order to support their families. These were identified as significant risk variables (P&gt;0.05). And also, this study identified those who receiving insufficient socioeconomic assistance were more likely to experience multiple psychological discomfort [atleast 1] than women who got appropriate economic support. (r = -0.112, P &lt; 0.001) Conclusion: COVID-19 infection during pregnancy was associated with increased levels of generalized anxiety scores. Patient-tailored psychological support should be a mainstay of comprehensive antenatal medical care in order to avoid anxiety- related complications.","Kannappan, J.; Mannam, A.

"Psychotropic medication challenges in patients with COVID-19","he SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought a ""new reality"" into the management of patients with mental disorders. Due to the lack of Covid-19 specific psychopharmacology guidelines as well as shortage of clinical experiences, prescribing psychotropic medications to Covid-19 patients may be associated with some challenges. Interactions between psychotropic drugs and drugs for the treatment of Covid-19, and the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs on the symptoms of infection occasionally require adjustment of psychopharmacotherapy in Covid-19 psychiatric patients. On the other hand, the potential drug-drug interactions and the effect of psychotropic drugs on the course of infection should be considered when treating psychopathological symptoms that may be caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection or drugs used to treat the infection. In the paper, several considerations in prescribing psychopharmacotherapy to patients with Covid-19 are discussed and, based on the literature published in recent months, recommendations for the choice of therapy for acute psychiatric conditions in these patients are summarized.","Celofiga, A.; Smogavc, Z.","https://doi.org/10.6016/ZdravVestn.3186","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Zdravniski Vestnik; 90(9/10):550-558, 2021.; Publication details: Zdravniski Vestnik; 90(9/10):550-558, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22725,""
"Higher coronavirus disease-19 mortality linked to comorbidities: A comparison between low-middle income and high-income countries","BACKGROUND: Global burden of disease (GBD) provides the estimates of mortality and morbidity, while case fatality rate (CFR) helps in understanding the severity of the disease. People infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) with underlying medical conditions have shown higher levels of unfavorable outcomes including mortality. We assessed the association of SARS-CoV-2 CFR with disability-adjusted life years (DALY) of various comorbidities in the low-middle income countries (LMIC) and high-income countries (HIC) to study the relationship of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) mortality with GBDs and to understand the linkage between COVID-19 mortality and comorbidities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was an ecological study with secondary data analysis comparing the DALY of various morbidities from GBD with CFR of COVID-19. Gross domestic product was the basis of stratifying 177 countries into low-middle income (LMIC) and high-income groups (HIC). The mortality was analyzed using Pearson correlation and linear regression. RESULTS: The median global CFR of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.15. The median CFR among LMIC (n = 60) and HIC (n = 117) was 2.01 (0.00-28.20) and 2.29 (0.00-17.26), respectively. The regression analysis found that, in both LMIC and HIC, maternal disorders were associated with higher SARS-CoV-2 CFR, while tuberculosis, mental health disorders, and were associated with lower CFR. Further, in LMIC, musculoskeletal disorders and nutritional deficiencies were associated with higher CFR, while respiratory disorders were associated with lower CFR. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection appears to be a systemic disease. Individuals with comorbidities, such as maternal disorders, neurological diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, and nutritional deficiencies, have poorer outcomes with COVID-19, leading to higher mortality.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Industrial Organisational Psychologists in South Africa: Imagining new professional roles","Orientation: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world of work. An understanding is needed of this impact and the positioning of roles of professional psychologists in response to adjusting to the new normal. Research purpose: This study investigated the challenges faced by Industrial Organisational (IO) Psychologists in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the study aimed at ascertaining the professional roles that emanate from such challenges. Motivation of the study: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, calls exist within the literature for nuanced disciplinary studies that explore the impact of the pandemic. One such discipline is that of Industrial Psychology (IP), a discipline deemed important not only for the development of individuals but also for organisations. Research approach, design and method: A qualitative research approach utilising semi-structured interviews was conducted with 25 IO Psychologists. Thematic analysis was utilised to analyse the collected data using the suggestions by Braun and Clarke. Main findings: Two main findings emerged from the study informed by the thematic analysis conducted. Firstly, the IO Psychologists expressed challenges of a direct nature affecting their practice and individual well-being. Secondly, the participating IO Psychologists suggested resultant professional roles that emerged from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These included (1) prioritisation of personal physical and mental health, (2) more technological skills and acumen needed to adjust to the challenges posed by the pandemic, (3) promotion of continued professional learning and (4) the necessity for support networks amongst practitioners. Practical/managerial implications: Implications are drawn for the practitioners and individuals working within the IO Psychology context. These extend at assisting the practitioners within the presented challenges. Contribution/value-add: Through the findings, suggestions to inform IO Psychology as a practice are made. Furthermore, roles in assisting IO Psychologists to adjust to the new normal are suggested. The study becomes one of the first within these disciplines to charter suggestions for this important practice.","Chinyamurindi, Willie T.; Masha, Anthony K.; Tshabalala, Ntombekhaya","https://doi.org/10.4102/sajip.v47i0.1876","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: SA Journal of Industrial Psychology; 47, 2021.; Publication details: SA Journal of Industrial Psychology; 47, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22727,""
"Compliance Indicators of COVID-19 Prevention and Vaccines Hesitancy in Kenya: A Random-Effects Endogenous Probit Model","Vaccine hesitancy remains a major public health concern in the effort towards addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. This study analyzed the effects of indicators of compliance with preventive practices on the willingness to take COVID-19 vaccines in Kenya. The data were from the COVID-19 Rapid Response Phone Surveys conducted between January and June 2021 during the fourth and fifth waves. The data were analyzed with the random-effects endogenous Probit regression model, with estimated parameters tested for robustness and stability. The results showed that willingness to take vaccines increased between the fourth and fifth waves. Compliance with many of the preventive practices also improved, although the utilizations of immune system-promoting practices were very low. The panel Probit regression results showed that compliance indicators were truly endogenous and there was existence of random effects. Immune system-boosting and contact-prevention indicators significantly increased and decreased the willingness to take vaccines, respectively (p &lt;0.01). The experience of mental health disorders in the form of nervousness and hopelessness also significantly influenced vaccine hesitancy (p &lt;0.10). Willingness to take vaccines also significantly increased among older people and those with a formal education (p &lt;0.01). Different forms of association exist between vaccine hesitancy and the prevention compliance indicators. There is a need to properly sensitize the people to the need to complement compliance with COVID-19 contact-prevention indicators with vaccination. Addressing mental health disorders in the form of loneliness, nervousness, depression, hopelessness and anxiety should also become the focus of public health, while efforts to reduce vaccine hesitancy should focus on individuals without formal education, males and youths.","Oyekale, Abayomi Samuel","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9111359","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1359, 2021.; Publication details: Vaccines; 9(11):1359, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22728,""
"The Prevalence of â€˜â€˜Food Addictionâ€™â€™ during the COVID-19 Pandemic Measured Using the Yale Food Addiction Scale 20 (YFAS 20) among the Adult Population of Poland","The announcement of the coronavirus pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), ongoing restrictions and isolation led to a break with the daily routine, and suspension of social contacts, but also imposed new challenges on the population related to maintaining healthy eating habits. The purpose of the study was to assess the prevalence of â€œfood addictionâ€ (FA) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland in relation to several variables including depression. The method of analysis was a questionnaire containing original questions and the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 (YFAS). A total of 1022 Polish residents aged 18â€“75 participated in the study (N = 1022;93.7% women, 6.3% men). The prevalence of FA during the COVID-19 pandemic measured with the YFAS 2.0 scale was 14.1%. The average weight gain during the pandemic in 39% of respondents was 6.53 kg. Along with the increase in the value of the BMI index, the intensity of â€œfood addictionâ€ increased in the study group. People with depression had statistically significantly more FA symptoms than healthy people. This work may motivate future research to evaluate the association and potential overlap of â€œfood addictionâ€ and problem eating behaviors during the pandemic and the obesity problem.","Zielinska, Magdalena, Luszczki, Edyta, Bartosiewicz, Anna, Wyszynska, Justyna, Deren, Katarzyna","https://doi.org/10.3390/nu13114115","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(11):4115, 2021.; Publication details: Nutrients; 13(11):4115, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22729,""
"Meta-Analysis of Prevalence of Depression in Dental Students during COVID-19 Pandemic","Background and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on the mental health of the population in general, and in college students in particular. Dental students have seen their teaching altered and their clinical practice reduced. This study was aimed at conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting levels of depression among dental students during the COVID-19 and estimating the pooled prevalence of depression. Materials and Methods: Medline via PubMed and other databases were searched for studies on the prevalence of depression in dental undergraduates, published from 1 December 2019 to 1 September 2021. The pooled proportions of depression were calculated with random effects models. Results: We identified 13 studies from 9 countries. The pooled prevalence of depression in dental students was 37% (95% CI: 26â€“49%) with no variation due to gender, response rate or methodological quality. We only found a significantly higher prevalence of depression in studies from Asia compared to Europe and America. Conclusions: Our results suggest that dental students are suffering from higher levels of depression compared with the general population or other college students during the COVID-19 pandemic, with differences across regions.

"Impact of the COVID-19 on Emergency Department Workload and Emergency Care Workersâ€™ Psychosocial Stress in a Local Pandemic Area","Background and Objectives: Due to the unexpected spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there was a serious crisis of emergency medical system collapse. Healthcare workers working in the emergency department were faced with psychosocial stress and workload changes. Materials and Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey of healthcare workers in the emergency department in Daegu and Gyeongbuk, Korea, from November 16 to 25, 2020. In the survey, we assessed the general characteristics of the respondents;changes in the working conditions before and after the COVID-19 pandemic;and resulting post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anxiety statuses using 49 questions. Results: A total of 529 responses were collected, and 520 responses were included for the final analyses. Changes in working conditions and other factors due to COVID-19 varied by emergency department level, region and disease group. Working hours, intensity, role changes, depression and anxiety scores were higher in the higher level emergency department. Isolation ward insufficiency and the risk of infection felt by healthcare workers tended to increase in the lower level emergency department. Treatment and transfer delay were higher in the fever and respiratory disease groups (M = 3.58, SD = 1.18;M = 4.08, SD = 0.95), respectively.

"Effects of Facial Muscles Exercise on Mental Health: A Systematic Review","Mental disorders are increasing worldwide. Previous research has reported an association between mental health and facial expressions. Face-to-face communication, specifically, is majorly affected when wearing face masks for a long time because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there have been no systematic reviews of facial muscles exercise intervention studies for mental health. Thus, evidence of their effect on mental health is unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the current evidence of the effectiveness of voluntary facial muscles exercise to improve some parameters of mental health. We implemented a systematic review of experimental studies (published between 2007 and 2018, 10 years before we decided to start this review). Of the 61,096 references screened, seven studies reported that facial muscles exercise may help to improve some parameters of mental health. Moreover, the study quality was assessed, and we extracted sub outcomes for mental health. Non-coherent results of seven experimental studies were included in this review. Voluntary facial muscles exercise may help improve depressive symptoms, mood, and reduce the level of chronic stress. However, due to the low quality of analyzed studies, further studies are needed to confirm the mental health benefits of a facial muscles exercise program.","Okamoto, Rumiko, Manabe, Toshie, Mizukami, Katsuyoshi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212216","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12216, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12216, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22732,""
"Increases in Alcohol and Cannabis Use Associated with Deteriorating Mental Health among LGBTQ2+ Adults in the Context of COVID-19: A Repeated Cross-Sectional Study in Canada, 2020â€“2021","Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, other queer, and Two-Spirit (LGBTQ2+) people are particularly at risk for the psycho-social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, though population-tailored research within this context remains limited. This study examines the extent of, and associations between, increased alcohol and cannabis use and deteriorating mental health among LGBTQ2+ adults in Canada during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data are drawn from LGBTQ2+ respondents to a repeated, cross-sectional survey administered to adults living in Canada (May 2020â€“January 2021). Bivariate cross-tabulations and multivariable logistic regression models were utilized to examine associations between increased alcohol and cannabis use, and self-reported mental health, overall coping, and suicidal thoughts. Five-hundred and two LGBTQ2+ participants were included in this analysis. Of these, 24.5% reported increased alcohol use and 18.5% reported increased cannabis use due to the pandemic. In the adjusted analyses, increased alcohol use was associated with poor overall coping (OR = 2.28;95% CI = 1.28â€“4.07) and worse self-reported mental health (OR = 1.98;95% CI = 1.21â€“3.25), whereas increased cannabis use was associated with suicidal thoughts (OR = 2.30;95% CI = 1.16â€“4.55). These findings underscore the need for population-tailored, integrated substance use and mental health supports to address interrelated increases in alcohol/cannabis use and worsening mental health among LGBTQ2+ adults, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Goodyear, Trevor, Slemon, Allie, Richardson, Chris, Gadermann, Anne, Salway, Travis, Dhari, Shivinder, Knight, Rod, Jenkins, Emily","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212155","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12155, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12155, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22733,""
"Predictors of positive and negative emotions experienced by poles during the second wave of the covid-19 pandemic","The objective of the research was to specify the predictors of positive and negative emotions experienced by Poles during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The researchers used the following standardized measurement tools: emotions (PANAS), mood (UMACL), satisfaction with life (SWLS), optimism (LOT-R), and coping with stress (CISS). They also used a question-naire to collect sociodemographic information and data concerning COVID-19 infections. In total, 595 participants (80.50% women) aged 18â€“75 participated in the research. It was concluded that the predictors of positive emotions included a task-oriented coping style, level of satisfaction with life, being a man, hedonic tone in the description of mood, and being an employed student. The negative predictors of positive emotions included emotion-oriented coping and the level of energetic arousal in the description of mood. The predictors of negative emotions were tense arousal in the description of mood, emotion-oriented coping, being over 60 years of age, and changes in respondentsâ€™ standard of living. The negative predictors of negative emotions included living in a medium-sized town or in a village. The research conclusions encourage us to pay special attention to possible at-risk groups threatened with mental health disorders and to factors that protect people against negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Relationships Among the Internal Health Locus of Control, Mental Health Problems, and Subjective Well-Being of Adults in South Korea","The purpose of this study was to confirm the relationship between internal health locus of control, mental health problems, and subjective well-being in adults during the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the mediating effect of mental health problems on the relationship between internal health locus of control and subjective well-being was examined. A cross-sectional descriptive design was conducted via online survey. The participants were 600 adults over 20 years of age living in South Korea. The collected data were analyzed using hierarchical regression analysis and SPSS Process Macro (Model 4). As a result of the study, the internal health locus of control had a significant negative effect on mental health problems. In addition, in the process of the internal health locus of control affecting subjective well-being, the mediating effect of mental health problems was significantly shown. In the period of an infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19, it is necessary to establish a strong internal health locus of control of individuals and to promote monitoring and treatment introduction for those with a low internal health locus of control. In addition, it was discussed that controlling mental health problems can improve subjective well-being, which is life satisfaction and happiness.","Shin, Sunhwa, Lee, Eunhye","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111588","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1588, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1588, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22735,""
"Effects of Leisure Obstacles, Job Satisfaction, and Physical and Mental Health on Job Intentions of Medical Workers Exposed to COVID-19 Infection Risk and Workplace Stress","The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of leisure obstacles, job satisfaction, physical and mental health, and work intentions of medical workers in Taiwan. SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 24.0 statistical software were used to analyze 208 questionnaires by basic statistical tests, t-tests, and structural model analysis. Results: Under the epidemic, medical workers were unable to develop job identity due to low promotion opportunities and low job achievement. The lack of recreational exercise skills, time, and information created leisure obstacles. In addition, they were unable to express their true selves freely at work, which led to health problems such as reduced enthusiasm, mental weakness, and emotional irritability. In particular, female medical workers felt more strongly about the issues of leisure obstacles and the intention to stay in their jobs. The study found that the higher their job satisfaction, the higher their intention to stay in the job, while the more pronounced the leisure obstacles and physical and mental health problems, the more pronounced their intention to leave.","Lin, Hsiao-Hsien, Lin, Jan-Wei, Chen, Chao-Chien, Hsu, Chin-Hsien, Lai, Bing-Sen, Lin, Tzu-Yun","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111569","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1569, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1569, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22736,""
"Isolation Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic in People Suffering from Parkinsonâ€™s Disease and Activity, Self-Assessment of Physical Fitness and the Level of Affective Disorders","Background: Staying at home for long periods and limiting various types of activities and social contacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic may have negative consequences for health. This is especially true for people suffering from chronic diseases, in whom an appropriate level of activity and social contacts delay the progress of the disease. This group includes people diagnosed with Parkinsonâ€™s diseaseâ€”PD. Aim: It was decided to investigate the effect of COVID-19 isolation related to self-assessment of physical fitness, physical activity, and the level of anxiety and depression in people with PD. Methods: The study included 30 patients diagnosed with Parkinsonâ€™s disease. We compared the results of the pre-pandemic questionnaire and the telephone interview with the same questionsâ€”after the period of isolation due to COVID-19. The questionnaire included questions about physical activity and fitness self-assessment. The level of affective disorders was tested using HADS. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in the physical activity of the respondents after isolation related to COVID-19 (p &lt;0.05). Self-assessment of physical fitness also decreased, but the differences were not statistically significant. In the post-isolation study, only 50% of the respondents had normative values for anxiety and only 40% for depression. The analysis showed that the level of physical activityâ€”the independent variable, explains anxiety in 30% and depression in 27%. Conclusions: Pandemic isolation has significantly reduced physical activity in PD patients. There was a certain drop in the self-esteem of physical fitness in these people. Physical fitness is an important predictor of preventing the affective disorders of anxiety and depression. The effects of isolation due to COVID-19 require further research.","Knapik, Andrzej, Szefler-Derela, Justyna, Wasiuk-Zowada, Dagmara, Siuda, Joanna, Krzystanek, Ewa, Brzek, Anna","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111562","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1562, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1562, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22737,""
"Who Cares What the Doctor Feels: The Responsibility of Health Politics for Burnout in the Pandemic","Modern health has become a defining facet of contemporary life managed by health policy. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected mental health, resulting in stress and anxiety in doctorsâ€™ professional and private life. Since the beginning of the pandemic, doctors have been facing chronic stress, which was reported to the hospital managers and health-care agencies, but nothing was done in the practice to protect them. Although doctors are trained to stay emotionally restrained, a large number of patients in intensive care, along with the personal concerns for their families, has led to burnout. This article highlights the need for health politics to take responsibility for dealing with burnout in health-care workers with a new approach that should help doctors recognize, understand, and manage work-related stress with additional support in the pandemic.","Karacic, Jasna, Bursztajn, Harold J.; Arvanitakis, Marianna","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111550","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1550, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1550, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22738,""
"COVID-19 Lockdown-Related Changes in Mood, Health and Academic Functioning","The COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns were accompanied by an abrupt transition from face-to-face education to online education. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic functioning and mood in Dutch pharmacy students and PhD candidates. A total of n = 341 participants completed an online survey including questions on mood and academic functioning, assessed retrospectively for before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, during COVID-19 lockdown, significantly more time was spent on academic activities, and study grades/output significantly improved. However, the overall effects were of small magnitude, and there was great variability among students, reporting either improved, unchanged or poorer academic functioning. Compared to before COVID-19, the lockdown periods were associated with significantly increased levels of stress, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and loneliness, and a significant reduction in optimism and happiness. Significant negative correlations were found between â€˜performance qualityâ€™ and stress, â€˜performance qualityâ€™ and fatigue, â€˜study grades/outputâ€™ and stress, and between â€˜study grades/outputâ€™ and fatigue. Correlations of mood and items related to academic interactions were not statistically significant. Differential effects were seen when the data was analyzed according to sex, living situation, and ethnicity, revealing that women, students living alone, and those with a migration background reported that COVID-19 lockdowns had greater negative mood effects and a more negative impact on academic functioning. Poorer sleep quality and reduced quality of life were significantly associated with reduced mood, as well as reduced academic performance quality and role satisfaction. Regression analysis revealed that being young and not having a non-Western migration background were predictors of improved performance quality. However, only being young was a significant predictor of improved study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased levels of stress and fatigue were significant predictors of both reduced performance quality and poorer study grades/output during the COVID-19 pandemic. In conclusion, for the sample as a whole, the transition to online education during the COVID-19 lockdown was judged as having significant positive effects on academic performance. The lockdown periods were associated with significantly reduced mood and reduced social interactions. It should be taken into account that about one third of students reported academic functioning to be poorer during the COVID-19 pandemic. This represents a substantial group of students who require more attention and guidance to make a successful transition to online education and cope with lockdown-associated stress and fatigue.","Hendriksen, Pauline A.; Garssen, Johan, Bijlsma, Elisabeth Y.; Engels, Ferdi, Bruce, Gillian, Verster, Joris C.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe11040103","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education; 11(4):1440-1461, 2021.; Publication details: European Journal of Investigation in Health, Psychology and Education; 11(4):1440-1461, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22739,""
"Quality of Life among Pediatric Neurocognitive, Speech, and Psychomotor Rehabilitation Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Study on an Italian Sample","Objective: The aim was to estimate the perceived quality of life and its relationship with sociodemographic and professional factors, perception of susceptibility to COVID-19, and stress. Design: It was a longitudinal study. Subjects: Professionals, working in Italian centers for pediatric neurocognitive, speech, and psychomotor rehabilitation. Methods: Participants were interviewed online twice during the COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. The questionnaire included: (i) The measures of health-related quality of life to perform the Summary Index of Unhealthy Days, (ii) modified items from the â€œStandard questionnaire on risk perception of an infectious disease outbreakâ€ and (iii) the items of the General Health Questionnaire. Results: One hundred and thirty professionals out of 130 participated in the first interview, while only 50 therapists took part in the second interview (dropout rate: 61%). The Summary Index of Unhealthy Days was 8 days at the first interview, and it decreased to 6 days at the second interview;however, the reduction was not significant (F = 3.22;p = 0.079). The multivariable analysis showed that the rehabilitation providers with moderate or severe stress level were more likely to have a negative perception of the quality of life (ORadj = 7.155;95% CI: 2.8â€“18.2), and this result was confirmed at the second interview. Conclusions: Our results showed that in a severe public health emergency, the mental health and quality of life of rehabilitation professionals must be a topic of focus to enhance psychological resilience, to prevent burnout and to reduce rehabilitation errors.","Cofini, Vincenza, Bianchini, Valeria, Muselli, Mario, Budroni, Danila, Tobia, Loreta, CalÃ², Giovanna Letizia, Fabiani, Leila, Necozione, Stefano","https://doi.org/10.3390/clinpract11040101","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Clinics and Practice; 11(4):860-869, 2021.; Publication details: Clinics and Practice; 11(4):860-869, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22740,""
"Anxiety, Perceived Stress, and Resilience during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Population Estimates of Persons Presenting to a General Practitioner in Romania","Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are experiencing severe mental distress. Thus, during the last year, drastic changes occurred in everyday life of every human being. Following social distancing and economic insecurity, significant increases in mental health concerns (loneliness, anxiety, depression, or insomnia) have developed. The objective of this study was to explore the anxiety, perceived stress, and resilience in a population presenting at the general practitioner, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected between February and April 2021 and 440 individuals who presented to the general practitioner were evaluated. Concerning anxiety level, almost half of the respondents (49,3%, N = 217) scored above the threshold value on the anxiety scale (mild intensity 38.6%, moderate intensity 9.9%, severe intensity 0.8%). Having a low level of resilience, as well as experiencing a high level of stress, are both predictive of the occurrence of high anxiety (p &lt;0.001, r = -0.551 and p &lt;0.001, r = 0.622, respectively). Furthermore, resilience is negatively related to perceived stress (p &lt;0.001, r = -0.676). It is critical in the current crisis to recognize those at risk of developing mental illnesses, taking into consideration the various socioeconomic classes, as well as to maintain and improve the general publicâ€™s mental health using appropriate psychological interventions.","Ionescu, Tiberiu Constantin, Fetecau, Bogdana Ioana, Boscaiu, Voicu, Tudose, Catalina","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111541","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1541, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1541, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22741,""
"Persistence of the Effects of the COVID-19 Lockdown on Sleep: A Longitudinal Study","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on sleep have been widely documented, but longitudinal evaluations during different phases of the â€œCOVID-19 eraâ€ are needed to disentangle the specific consequences of the r145estrictive measures on sleep variables. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate effect of the lockdownâ€™s end on sleep and sleep-related dimensions in an Italian sample, also considering the stress and depressive symptoms. We used an online survey to longitudinally collect data on sociodemographic, environmental, clinical, sleep, and sleep-related variables in two time points: during and immediately after the lockdown. The final sample included 102 participants. The large prevalence of poor sleep quality, clinically relevant pre-sleep arousal, and depressive symptoms, as well as poor sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal score observed during the lockdown, remained stable after its end. On the other hand, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe event-related stress and intrusive symptom scores exhibited a drastic reduction after the end of home confinement. Both bedtime and rise time were anticipated after the lockdown, while sleep quality exhibited only a trend of post-lockdown sleep disturbance reduction. Our findings point to a reduced stress level (specific for the intrusive symptomatology) after the end of the lockdown and persistence of sleep problems, suggesting two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses: (a) the strict restrictive measures are not the main cause of sleep problems during the pandemic and (b) home confinement induces long-lasting effects on sleep observable after its end, and a longer period of time might be needed to observe an improvement.","Gorgoni, Maurizio, Scarpelli, Serena, Mangiaruga, Anastasia, Alfonsi, Valentina, Bonsignore, Maria R.; Fanfulla, Francesco, Ferini-Strambi, Luigi, Nobili, Lino, Plazzi, Giuseppe, De Gennaro, Luigi, Medicine, on behalf of the Board of the Italian Association of Sleep","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11111520","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1520, 2021.; Publication details: Brain Sciences; 11(11):1520, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22742,""
"A Practical and Adaptive Approach to Predicting Indoor CO2","COVID-19 has underlined the importance of monitoring indoor air quality (IAQ) to guarantee safe conditions in enclosed environments. Due to its strict correlation with human presence, carbon dioxide (CO2) represents one of the pollutants that most affects environmental health. Therefore, forecasting future indoor CO2 plays a central role in taking preventive measures to keep CO2 level as low as possible. Unlike other research that aims to maximize the prediction accuracy, typically using data collected over many days, in this work we propose a practical approach for predicting indoor CO2 using a limited window of recent environmental data (i.e., temperature;humidity;CO2 of, e.g., a room, office or shop) for training neural network models, without the need for any kind of model pre-training. After just a week of data collection, the error of predictions was around 15 parts per million (ppm), which should enable the system to regulate heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems accurately. After a month of data we reduced the error to about 10 ppm, thereby achieving a high prediction accuracy in a short time from the beginning of the data collection. Once the desired mobile window size is reached, the model can be continuously updated by sliding the window over time, in order to guarantee long-term performance.","Segala, Giacomo, Doriguzzi-Corin, Roberto, Peroni, Claudio, Gazzini, Tommaso, Siracusa, Domenico","https://doi.org/10.3390/app112210771","","Database: MDPI; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(22):10771, 2021.; Publication details: Applied Sciences; 11(22):10771, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22743,""
"COVID-19-Related Variables and Its Association with Anxiety and Suicidal Ideation: Differences Between International and Local University Students in Taiwan","Purpose: The present study examined the differences between international and local university students in Taiwan regarding COVID-19-related variables, anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Participants and Methods: An online cross-sectional survey (sent via an online link in an email) was carried out comprising university students (n=529). The students were assessed on measures (including validated psychometric instruments) of perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, perceived sufficiency of resources, sources of COVID-19 information, perceived satisfaction with support, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Results: Local students had higher susceptibility to COVID-19 (p&lt; 0.001) but decreased sufficiency with resources (p&lt; 0.001) and anxiety (p&lt; 0.001) compared with international students. Staying with family members, satisfaction with support, and information seeking were the factors that predicted anxiety among international students (all p-values&lt; 0.05), while information seeking predicted local studentsâ€™ anxiety (p&lt; 0.001). Furthermore, staying with family members, susceptibility to COVID-19, and sufficiency with resources were the factors that predicted suicidal ideation among international students (all p-values&lt; 0.05), while being a male and satisfaction with support predicted suicidal ideation among local students (all p-values&lt; 0.05). Conclusion: International students displayed different COVID-19-related challenges compared with local students. More specifically, international students as compared with local students had lower susceptibility to COVID-19 and higher anxiety. Therefore, healthcare providers should pay more attention to international studentsâ€™ psychological health and awareness regarding impacts of COVID-19 on health.","Ahorsu, Daniel Kwasi, Iqbal, Pramukti, Strong, Carol, Hsiao-Wen, Wang, Griffiths, Mark D.; Chung-Ying, Lin, Nai-Ying, Ko","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S333226","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Psychology Research and Behavior Management; 14:1857-1866, 2021.; Publication details: Psychology Research and Behavior Management; 14:1857-1866, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22744,""
"Changes in Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviors During COVID-19: Associations with Psychological Distress Among Mothers","Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic increased mothersâ€™ caregiving demands, potentially placing them at increased risk for reduced engagement in healthful behaviors and high psychological distress. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe perceived changes in moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary behaviors and the prevalence of different measures of psychological distress (depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, and positive and negative affect) among mothers. We also evaluated the associations of perceived change in MVPA and sedentary behaviors with measures of psychological distress. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 317 mothers living with children (0â€“ 20 years old) at home. Mothers self-reported perceived changes in MVPA and sedentary behaviors from before the pandemic to during COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and early reopening, and levels of depression and anxiety symptomatology, perceived stress, and positive and negative affect during the pandemic. Results: Compared to pre-pandemic levels, 39% of mothers reported engaging less in MVPA, and 63% reported engaging in more sedentary activities. One-quarter and 31% of mothers reported moderate/severe depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively, and 78% medium/high levels of perceived stress. Adjusted linear regression analyses revealed that reduced MVPA and increased sedentary behaviors were associated with high average scores of depressive and anxiety symptoms, perceived stress, negative affect, and low scores of positive affect. Conclusion: A large proportion of mothers reported being less physically active and more engaged in sedentary behaviors, which were associated with increases in psychological distress. Clinical and public health intervention efforts should consider how to improve mothersâ€™ physical and mental health as the country emerges from this crisis.","de Brito, Junia N.; Friedman, Jessica K.; Emery, Rebecca L.; Neumark-Sztainer, Dianne, Berge, Jerica M.; Mason, Susan M.","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S333719","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Women's Health; 13:1115-1122, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Women's Health; 13:1115-1122, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22745,""
"Symptoms of anxiety, depression and fear in healthcare workers and non-healthcare workers undergoing outpatient COVID-19 testing in an urban Australian setting","This study assessed symptoms of anxiety, depression and fear of COVID-19 in members of the general community and healthcare workers (HCWs) attending for COVID testing. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a public hospital COVID-19 testing clinic (June-September 2020) using self-administered questionnaires (i.e. the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale). In all, 430 participants who met the criteria for COVID-19 testing with nasopharyngeal and throat swabs completed the questionnaires. The mean (Ã‚Â±s.d.) age of participants was 37.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.6 years. HCWs made up 35.1% of the sample. Overall, the mean (Ã‚Â±s.d.) score for anxiety was 6.09Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.41 and 'case' prevalence (any severity) was 151/430 (35.1%), higher than normative population scores. Higher anxiety was found in women (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and in clients who had previously been tested for coronavirus (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). HCWs had lower anxiety scores than members of the general community (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). For depression, the mean (Ã‚Â±s.d.) score was 4.18Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.60, with a 'case' prevalence (any severity) of 82/430 (19.1%), similar to normative population scores.

A greater psychological impact of COVID-19 was observed in women, people undergoing repeat testing and participants reporting lower levels of educational attainment. HCWs had fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression than non-HCWs attending the same clinic for COVID-19 testing.

"Measuring anxiety related to COVID-19: Factor analysis and psychometric properties of the Arabic Coronavirus Anxiety Scale","Literature reports that fear and anxiety related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic may be a significant factor in promoting adherence to health-protective behaviours. This study aimed to validate an Arabic version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale (CAS). Participants aged 18 to 58 years of age were recruited from a university population (students and staff) as well as via social media from 22 June to 18 July 2020 when the United Arab Emirates was under a partial government-instituted lockdown. They completed Arabic versions of the CAS and the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. A confirmatory factor analysis produced a unidimensional structure and all items satisfactorily loaded onto this single factor (i.e., the physiological symptoms of fear and anxiety related to coronavirus). The Arabic CAS was internally consistent and concurrently valid. These preliminary findings suggest that the Arabic CAS is a valid and reliable instrument to employ in the assessment of dysfunctional anxiety related to coronavirus. The availability of this validated measure will enable the further conduct of a variety of mental health studies in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also holds clinical utility as a potential screening measure for those afflicted by anxiety symptomology during the pandemic.","Vally, Alowais","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260355","20211124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22747,""
"COVID-19: Update on Health Care Workers' Mental Health and Coping During the Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, health care workers experienced much higher symptoms of anxiety or depression than during the prepandemic period.

"Nursing Strategies to Safeguard COVID-19 Patients From Harm in the Intensive Care Unit","The aim of this article is to identify quality improvement nursing strategies that have been implemented to safeguard COVID-19 patients from harm while being cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU). This article incorporates a literature review on the experiences of nurses working at a large urban teaching hospital in the areas of critical care, quality, safety, and regulatory. As leaders in the delivery of health care, nurses have always pioneered innovative ways to deliver care despite difficult circumstances. COVID-19 is a novel viral disease with many unknowns, and it required nurses to integrate innovative approaches with evidence-based practice in order to meet the needs of the patient and to ensure patient safety. While in the critical care setting, COVID-19 patients are at an increased risk for various hospital-acquired injuries, threats to personal safety, and decline in mental health. Through ingenuity and adaptability, successful nursing strategies have been identified in the delivery of quality, evidence-based nursing care to safeguard the vulnerable COVID-19 patient population from harm while in the ICU.","Shiner, Bock, Simpson, Skorupski","https://doi.org/10.1097/CNQ.0000000000000383","20211124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22749,""
"COVID-19 Restrictions and Maternal Experience and Infant Feeding","The Movement Control Order (MCO), also known as the partial lockdown, was introduced in Malaysia in March 2020 to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, changing many public-sector protocols and regulations. This may have implications for neonatal and maternity care and services, especially among new mothers. To compare the postnatal experiences and feeding practices between mothers who gave birth before MCO (B-MCO) and during MCO (D-MCO). 1,051 mothers with an infant under 18 months in Malaysia completed an online survey between July 2020 and October 2020. The survey advertisement was disseminated online via various social media platforms. More D-MCO mothers faced a significant effect on the ability to pay rent/mortgage, with their spouses facing a higher impact on employment. D-MCO mothers were more likely to have changed their birth plans, perceived insufficient breastfeeding support, and experienced changes in postnatal services since MCO. In contrast, more B-MCO mothers had stopped breastfeeding during the MCO and started complementary feeding earlier than planned. Many mothers reported feeling down, lonely, and having sleeping trouble and a poor appetite. D-MCO mothers had more time to focus on their health, whereas B-MCO mothers spent more time outdoors. MCO affected mothers' livelihood and postnatal experiences, potentially causing emotional distress. Hence, improved breastfeeding support, particularly at birth, is recommended, as is routine mental health screening during the postnatal check-up. Furthermore, since online contact was readily accessible during the pandemic, the efficacy of online breastfeeding support should be evaluated.","Shukri, Ying, Zalbahar, Tusimin, Nasri","https://doi.org/10.1097/NNR.0000000000000568","20211124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22750,""
"Mental Health Outcomes Among Italian Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Health care workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID-19 have high rates of mental health issues. However, longitudinal data on the evolution of mental health outcomes in HCWs are lacking. To evaluate the mental health outcomes among Italian HCWs 14 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This longitudinal cohort study collected data from March 1 to April 30, 2020 (T1) and from April 1 to May 31, 2021 (T2), from 2856 Italian HCWs aged 18 years or older who responded to an online questionnaire. Participants were also recruited via snowballing, a technique in which someone who receives the invitation to participate forwards it to his or her contacts. Frontline vs second-line position, job type, hospitalization for COVID-19, and colleagues or family members affected by COVID-19. Outcomes are depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, insomnia symptoms, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs). Four different trajectories are described for each condition: resilient, remittent, incident, and persistent. Of the 2856 HCWs, 997 (34.9%) responded to the follow-up assessment (mean [SD] age, 42.92 [10.66] years; 816 [82.0%] female). Depression symptoms (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.88; 95% CI, -4.05 to -1.71), anxiety symptoms (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.01; 95% CI, -3.13 to -0.88), and PTSSs (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.77; 95% CI, -1.13 to -0.42) decreased over time; insomnia symptoms increased (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.05; 95% CI, 1.63-4.47). Serving as a frontline HCW at T1 was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.04; 95% CI, -2.01 to -0.07), and hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with increased depression symptoms (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.96; 95% CI, 2.01-9.91); younger age (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.36; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.03) and serving as a frontline HCW at T1 (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.04; 95% CI, -1.98 to -0.11) were associated with decreased anxiety symptoms. Male sex was associated with increase in insomnia symptoms (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.46; 95% CI, 0.39-2.53). Serving as a frontline HCW at T1 (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.42; 95% CI, -0.71 to -0.13) and being a physician (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.52; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.24) were associated with a decrease in PTSSs, whereas younger age (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.35; 95% CI, 0.09-0.61) and male sex (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.22) were associated with an increase in PTSSs. Depression trajectories were 629 resilient (65.5%), 181 remittent (18.8%), 58 incident (6.0%), and 92 persistent (9.6%). Anxiety trajectories were 701 resilient (73.3%), 149 remittent (15.6%), 45 incident (4.7%), and 61 persistent (6.4%). Insomnia trajectories were 858 resilient (88.9%), 77 remittent (8.0%), 20 incident (2.1%), and 10 persistent (1.0%). The PTSS trajectories were 363 resilient (38.5%), 267 remittent (28.3%), 86 incident (9.1%), and 226 persistent (24.0%).

"Morally Injurious Experiences and Emotions of Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic Before Vaccine Availability","Moral injury in health care professionals (HPs) has worsened over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The trauma and burnout associated with moral injury has profound implications for the mental health of HPs. To explore the potential factors associated with moral injury for HPs who were involved in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, prior to the availability of vaccines. In this qualitative study, HPs were actively recruited to participate in a survey via snowball sampling via email and social media in 2 phases of 5 weeks each: April 24 to May 30, 2020 (phase 1), and October 24 to November 30, 2020 (phase 2). Overall, 1831 respondents answered demographic questions and assessments for moral injury, intrinsic religiosity, and burnout. Of those, 1344 responded to the open-ended questions. Responses to open-ended questions were coded iteratively and thematically analyzed within the framework of moral injury. Working in a patient care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the availability of vaccines. Inductive thematic analysis of open-response survey answers identified dominant emotions and common stressors associated with moral injury. There were 335 individuals (109 [32.6%] aged 35-44 years; 288 [86.0%] women; 294 [87.8%] White) in phase 1 and 1009 individuals (384 [38.1%] aged 35-44 years; 913 [90.5%] women; 945 [93.7%] White) in phase 2. In phase 1, the respondents were predominantly nurses (100 [29.9%]), physicians (78 [23.3%]), advanced practice practitioners (APPs) (70 [20.9%]), and chaplains (55 [16.4%]). In phase 2, the respondents were predominantly nurses (589 [58.4%]), physicians (114 [11.3%]), and APPs (104 [10.3%]). HPs faced numerous stressors, such as fear of contagion, stigmatization, short-staffing, and inadequate personal protective equipment. The emotions experienced were (1) fear in phase 1, then fatigue in phase 2; (2) isolation and alienation; and (3) betrayal. These findings suggest that HPs experienced moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moral injury was not only experienced after a single moral dilemma but also from working in morally injurious environments. These experiences can serve as potential starting points for organizations to engender and enhance organizational and individual recovery, team building, and trust. System-level solutions that address shortages in staffing and personal protective equipment are needed to promote HP well-being.","Song, Mantri, Lawson, Berger, Koenig","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.36150","20211124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22752,""
"Ethical Dilemmas, Moral Distress, and the Risk of Moral Injury: Experiences of Residents and Fellows During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the United States","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought numerous ethical dilemmas to the forefront of clinical care, including for resident and fellow physician trainees. In this paper, the authors draw on their own experiences providing frontline COVID-19 clinical care in New York City in their respective roles as an internal medicine resident and later a pulmonary and critical care fellow, and as an associate program director for a pulmonary and critical care fellowship, along with published literature on trainees' experiences in the pandemic, to describe common ethical dilemmas confronted by residents and fellows during the pandemic. These dilemmas are related to personal health risk; resource allocation; health care inequities; and media relations. The authors use a framework of microethics to underscore how these dilemmas are highly contextualized within trainees' institutions, their specific roles, and the patient populations to which they provide care. They argue that frequent ethical dilemmas, compounded by the intense physical and emotional stress of medical training and the pandemic itself, increase the potential for trainees to experience moral distress. Recurrent moral distress may, in turn, put trainees at risk for moral injury with consequences for their mental health and overall well-being. It is imperative to gain a clear understanding of this issue, not only for those trainees who have experienced or are at risk for experiencing personal consequences, but also because it may help identify ways to better support the well-being of providers and the care of patients going forward.","Farrell, Hayward","https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000004536","20211124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22753,""
"Pandemic-Related Disruptions in Nursing Education: Zooming out for an Innovative Interprofessional Simulation","When the COVID-19 global pandemic began, many higher education systems had to restructure their educational delivery system and transition to online learning.

"COMVC-19: A Program to protect healthcare workers' mental health during the COVID-19 Pandemic What we have learned","In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought a work and stress overload to healthcare workers, increasing their vulnerability to mental health impairments. In response, the authors created the COMVC-19 program. The program offered preventive actions and mental health treatment for the 22,000 workers of The Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de SÃƒÂ£o Paulo (HCFMUSP). This paper aims to describe its implementation and share what we have learned from this experience. Workers were able to easily access the program through a 24/7 hotline. Additionally, a mobile phone app that screened for signs and symptoms of emotional distress and offered psychoeducation and/or referral to treatment was made available. Data from both these sources as well as any subsequent psychiatric evaluations were collected. The first 20 weeks of our project revealed that most participants were female, and part of the nursing staff working directly with COVID-19 patients. The most frequently reported symptoms were: anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances. The most common diagnoses were Adjustment, Anxiety, and Mood disorders. Implementing a mental health program in a multimodal intervention was feasible in a major quaternary public hospital. Our data also suggests that preventive actions should primarily be aimed at anxiety and depression symptoms, with a particular focus on the nursing staff.","Fukuti, UchÃƒÂ´a, Mazzoco, Cruz, Echegaray, Humes, Silveira, Santi, Miguel, Corchs, Fatori, Campello, Oliveira, Argolo, Ferreira, Machado, Argeu, Oliveira, Serafim, Siqueira, Rossi, Rios, Oliveira, Antoniazzi, Gagliotti, Abelama Neto, Oliveira Junior, Correia, GonÃƒÂ§alves, Tortato, Busato, GuimarÃƒÂ£es-Fernandes, Alves, Leite Netto, Schoueri, Roque, Merlin, Boer, Sallet, Malbergier, Spedo, Kamitsuji, Faria, Moreira, Kaufman, Abdo, Scanavino, Lancman, Tavares, Polanczyk, Brunoni, Forlenza, Barros-Filho","https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2021/e2631","20211124","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22755,""

Besides the pregnancy, these women have additional risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome due to COVID-19 and are considered a particularly vulnerable, unique population. We aimed to assess their mental health during this pandemic. This is a cross-sectional study carried out at a Brazilian tertiary hospital. Women with pregnancies complicated by hypertension and/or diabetes were evaluated. The primary outcome was anxiety, and depressive symptoms evaluated with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Patient Health Questionnaire. Perception of changing habits during quarantine was evaluated as a secondary outcome. Seventy-nine patients were included. The prevalence of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Ã¢â€°Â¥40 was 79.7% and that of Patient Health Questionnaire Ã¢â€°Â¥10 was 59.2%. Lower social support was correlated with higher scores on both scales. Time spent with electronic devices was perceived as greater by 62% of the women.

"Trends of Anger and Physical Aggression in Russian Women During COVID-19 Lockdown","The effect of social lockdown during the COVID-19 outbreak on female aggressiveness is not well known. The strict measures of lockdown have resulted in millions of people, worldwide, confined to their homes during the pandemic. However, the consequence of lockdown strategies on females' psychological status including aggressiveness has not yet been investigated. We conducted a cross-sectional study on 31 Russian females' homemakers who are participants in an online fitness platform to investigate the immediate anxiety, depression, and aggression experienced under strict lockdown measures. The participants were surveyed using the hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) and the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire. We used descriptive and statistical methods to investigate the prevalence of these emotions among two age groups (20-35 and 36-65 years). We found that moderate anxiety prevalence was 77.4% in the entire group while mild depression was 54.8%. Interestingly, the whole sample showed a high level of angriness (<i>p</i> = 0.0002) and physical aggression (<i>p</i> = 0.019). These two emotions seem to be more prevalent than other negative emotions such as hostility, verbal aggression. This relationship was not dependent on age. Overall, there is a significant worsening in female aggression that could lead to higher chances of female victimization and being subjected to partner violence. Future policies designing lockdown strategies should consider this effect on active female homemakers. Due to the small size of our cohort, our results are only indicative of data trends. Larger studies are still needed to confirm the current findings.","Klimovich-Mickael, Kubick, Milanesi, Dobre, Ã…Âazarczyk, Wijas, Sacharczuk, Mickael","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.698151","20211124","angriness; anxiety; coronavirus; depression; psychological impact","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22757,""
"The Global Impact of COVID-19 on the Care of People With Endometriosis","Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting ~10% of women globally. Little is known about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on their care. This brief report is aimed to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the care of people with endometriosis around the world, their priorities in relation to their clinical care during and coming out of the pandemic, and whether they believed that endometriosis makes them more vulnerable to COVID-19. An internet-based survey collected data in five languages between May 11, 2020, and June 8, 2020. Only participants with a surgical or radiological diagnosis of endometriosis aged 18 years or over were included. A total of 6,729 eligible respondents completed the survey with 80.7% [95% CI (79.7, 81.6)] reporting a negative impact on their care. This included difficulties obtaining medication (20.3%), cancelled/postponed gynaecology appointments (50.0%), and cancelled/postponed procedures (37.2%). More than half worried that their endometrioses make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 [54.2%; 95% CI (53.0, 55.4)]. The top three priorities were remarkably consistent around the world: contact with gynaecologists, knowing when procedures would be performed, and support with mental health (20.3% prioritising this aspect during the pandemic and 13.0% as restrictions begin to ease). This study shows the substantial impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on people with endometriosis and describes how they would like care prioritised moving forwards. The findings regarding significant support needs for mental health add further weight to the growing recognition of attending to such issues as part of good patient-centred care.","Demetriou, Cox, Lunde, Becker, Invitti, MartÃƒÂ­nez-Burgo, Kvaskoff, Garbutt, Evans, Fox, Zondervan, Vincent","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.662732","20211124","COVID-19; endometriosis; mental health support; prioritisation; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22758,""
"Sleep Disruption and Depression, Stress and Anxiety Levels in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) During the Lockdown Measures for COVID-19 in the UK","<b>Background:</b> Lockdown measures have been enforced globally in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the comorbidity burden in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), these lockdown measures may have a particularly negative impact on sleep health, quality of life (QoL), and depression/stress levels in this population. The aim of this study was to explore whether such potential problems were present in women with PCOS during the COVID-19 lockdown in the UK. <b>Methods:</b> UK women with PCOS were recruited through social media into a cross-sectional study during the COVID-19 lockdown. The study survey was delivered online, and included demographic and COVID-19 relevant questions, as well as validated questionnaires/scales, namely the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and PCOSQOL questionnaire. <b>Results:</b> Three hundred and thirty-three women with PCOS [median age: 30.0 (9.0) years] were recruited. Participants were dichotomized based on responses regarding the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on their sleep [negative (<i>N</i> = 242) vs. no/positive (<i>N</i> = 91) impact]. No differences were noted between groups regarding age, time since PCOS diagnosis, body mass index, or number of comorbidities. Based on the ISI, 44.2% of participants reporting a negative impact on sleep exhibited at least moderately severe clinical insomnia. Compared to those who reported no/positive effect on sleep, the participants reporting a negative impact on sleep also reported poorer QoL, based on the total PCOSQOL score, with a greater impact of PCOS and poorer mood in the corresponding PCOSQOL domains. Based on the DASS-21, the latter also had statistically higher depression and stress levels compared to the former. Finally, for this cohort significant inverse correlations were noted between the ISI and PCOSQOL scores (total and domain scores), whilst the DASS-21 and ISI scores were positively correlated (all <i>p-</i>values &lt;0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The majority of recruited UK women with PCOS reported that the COVID-19 lockdown had a negative impact on their sleep, which was also associated with impaired QoL and higher depression/stress levels. Whilst further research is required, women with PCOS should be considered a vulnerable population that may experience an adverse impact on sleep, QoL and mental health well-being due to lockdown measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kite, Atkinson, McGregor, Clark, Brown, Kyrou, Randeva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.649104","20211124","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; lockdown; polycystic ovary syndrome; quality of life; sleep; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22759,""

Accordingly, we have highlighted the role of COVID-19 infection as a traumatic event during childbirth and its role in triggering a psychotic episode in women with vulnerabilities; difficulties faced by women with postpartum psychosis in accessing perinatal psychiatry services; and the challenges of admission into an inpatient Mother-Baby Unit (MBU). Further, we have discussed potential solutions from the perspectives of Lower and Middle-income (LAMI) countries that need to be extended beyond the pandemic.

"Prenatal Care Disruptions and Associations With Maternal Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","As the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) spread across Canada in March 2020, provinces imposed restrictions. These changes impacted how pregnant individuals received prenatal care and experienced childbirth. The stress caused by these changes may negatively affect the well-being of pregnant individuals with impacts on the developing child. This study investigated the impact of the pandemic on prenatal care and birth plans of pregnant individuals in Canada and potential associations with maternal mental health. Data from 4,604 participants was collected from English- and French-speaking Canadians between April 5 and June 1, 2020 as part of the Canada-wide Pregnancy During the COVID-19 Pandemic study. Symptoms of maternal depression, general anxiety, and pregnancy-related anxiety were assessed. Participants also answered questions about disruptions and changes to prenatal care and their birth plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Logistic regression was used to estimate associations between prenatal care disruptions and maternal mental health.

"COVID-19-Related Changes to Pregnant People's Work-Plans Increase Prenatal Depression","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented rates of unemployment in the United States. Pregnant workers may be especially affected as they are over-represented in low-wage service and hospitality industries impacted by the pandemic. We surveyed an online convenience sample of currently working pregnant people living in the U.S. (<i>n</i> = 1,417) to determine whether COVID-19-related changes to how long individuals planned to work during their pregnancy, and uncertainty about these changes, were associated with prenatal depression. As hypothesized, both COVID-19-related work-plan changes (OR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.36-2.42, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and uncertainty about the precise nature of these changes (OR = 2.62, 95% CI 1.14-6.0, <i>p</i> = 0.022) were associated with significantly higher odds of a clinically-significant depression score. These effects appeared to be even greater among individuals who continued working outside the home during the pandemic. Since the U.S. is one of the few countries in the world that does not guarantee paid parental leave, pregnant people may be forced to choose between keeping their jobs and risking infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate a need for immediate suspension of the eligibility requirements for the Family and Medical Leave Act and/or universal access to both paid family leave and prenatal depression screening. This would help to alleviate these concerns and provide pregnant people with more options while preserving their employment status and financial security.","Sherin, Gildner, Thayer","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.639429","20211124","Coronavirus; Family and Medical Leave Act; paid family leave; perinatal depression screening; pregnant workers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22762,""
"Anxiety, Health Self-Perception, and Worry About the Resurgence of COVID-19 Predict Fear Reactions Among Genders in the Cuban Population","The resurgence of COVID-19 could deepen the psychological impacts of the pandemic which poses new challenges for mental health professionals. Among the actions that should be prioritized is the monitoring of the groups that have shown greater psychological vulnerability during the first stage of the pandemic. The first aim of our study is to explore the fear reactions to COVID-19 between genders during the second wave of the outbreak in Cuba. Second, establish possible predictors of fear of COVID-19 in relation to gender. Specifically, we will evaluate how anxiety related to COVID-19, health self-perception, and worry about the resurgence of COVID-19 predict fear reactions among women and men in the Cuban population. A cross-sectional online study was designed. The research was conducted between August 16 and October 18, 2020. A total of 373 people completed the online survey. A socio-demographic questionnaire, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale and the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale were used. An independent-samples <i>t</i>-test was conducted to compare the fear, worry, anxiety and self-perceived health scores, between genders. The relationship between those variables and fear of COVID-19, was investigated using Pearson correlation coefficient. Finally, multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the possible associations (predictors) related to fear of COVID-19. In our study, women, compared to men, presented greater fear reactions, greater concern about resurgence of COVID-19 and poorer self-perceived health. Anxiety reactions in our sample showed no differences between genders. In women, anxiety of COVID-19, worry about resurgence of COVID-19, and self-perceived health are associated with fear reactions to COVID-19. In the case of men, the self-perceived health showed no associations with fear reactions. Our results confirm the results of several related investigations during the first wave of the pandemic where women have shown greater psychological vulnerability compared to men. However, we cannot rule out that the real impact of the pandemic on mental health in men is much greater than that described by the studies conducted to date. Additional studies are needed on the psychological impact of COVID-19 on men.","Broche-PÃƒÂ©rez, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Fleites, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-Castillo, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Puig, VizcaÃƒÂ­no-Escobar, Ferrer-Lozano, MartÃƒÂ­nez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, MartÃƒÂ­n-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.634088","20211124","anxiety; fear of COVID-19; gender; health self-perception; resurgence; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22763,""
"Psychological Distress Among Women Healthcare Workers: A Health System's Experience Developing Emotional Support Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Ensuring the mental health and well-being of the healthcare workforce globally, especially women healthcare workers (HCWs), is an ongoing challenge that has been accentuated by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Already at high risk of experiencing symptoms of stress, burnout, and depression, women HCWs are now also facing the psychosocial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although different types of mental health interventions have been introduced to support HCW well-being, the current needs of women HCWs have not been emphasized and replicable processes for developing and implementing specific emotional support services for women HCWs have not yet been well-described in the literature. Therefore, in this perspective, we discuss the approach our institution (University of California, Los Angeles) took for developing emotional support services for women HCWs that incorporate aspects of disaster behavioral health models and address various barriers to support and treatment. In addition, we describe and illustrate the process that we utilized to develop individual-level and institutional-level emotional support services. Finally, based on our institution's experience, we share recommendations for developing emotional support services for women HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic and other future crises.","Sanford, Agrawal, Miotto","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.614723","20211124","COVID-19; emotional support; healthcare worker; mental health; wellness; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22764,""
"""Crisis Within the Walls"": Rise of Intimate Partner Violence During the Pandemic, Indian Perspectives","The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has been a social ""un-equalizer,"" besides being a global health threat. Gender inequality has been globally prominent during the outbreak and the consequent lockdown. Although domestic abuse and intimate partner violence have increased due to chronic entrapment, overcrowding in families, enhanced substance use, distorted relationship dynamics, travel restrictions, and reduced healthcare access, coercive sexual practices have also been on the rise. In low- and middle-income countries, the lack of awareness, societal pressure, administrative apathy, fear of legal hassles, and inadequate knowledge-attitude-practice related to help-seeking lead to underreporting and mismanagement of domestic abuse, which can perpetuate its vicious cycle during the ongoing crisis. India, with its socio-culturally diverse population, has been one of the nations worst hit by the pandemic. With the rise in reports of gender-based violence on the premise of preexisting gender inequality and minority stress, concerns behind ""closed doors"" are as threatening as the infection itself. With this background, the authors highlight the backdrop of domestic violence as a ""hidden pandemic"" during the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, drawing on perspectives from India and briefly reviewing the data from other nations. The role of mental health education and digital literacy as mitigating strategies is subsequently discussed.","Nair, Banerjee","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.614310","20211124","COVID-19; domestic abuse; intimate partner violence; pandemic; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22765,""
"Predisposition of Women to Cardiovascular Diseases: A Side-Effect of Increased Glucocorticoid Signaling During the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created a significant health crisis worldwide. To mitigate this disease's spread, ""social distancing"" and ""shelter in place"" have been implemented. While these actions have been critical to controlling the pandemic, they have short- and long-term mental health consequences due to increased stress. There is a strong association between mental stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Young women (pre-menopausal) are at high risk of developing CV events in response to mental stress compared to age-matched men. The mechanisms underlying women's increased reactivity and response to stress are mostly unknown. The present review summarizes the known physiological consequences of mental stress in women's CV health and the latest molecular findings of the actions of the primary stress hormones, glucocorticoids, on the CV system. The current data suggest a clear link between psychological stress and heart disease, and women have an increased sensitivity to the harmful effects of stress hormone signaling imbalances. Therefore, it is expected that with the given unprecedented levels of stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, women's CV health will be significantly compromised. It is critical to widen our understanding of the direct contribution of mental stress to CVD risk in women and to identify biochemical markers with predictive value for CVD in female patients with/without cardiovascular conditions who have experienced significant mental stress during the current pandemic.","Dhaibar, Cruz-Topete","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2021.606833","20211124","COVID-19; cardiovascular risk; glucocorticoids; heart; pandemic; stress; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22766,""
"Occupational Stress, Burnout, and Depression in Women in Healthcare During COVID-19 Pandemic: Rapid Scoping Review","<b>Objectives:</b> The overall objectives of this rapid scoping review are to (a) identify the common triggers of stress, burnout, and depression faced by women in health care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (b) explore individual-, organizational-, and systems-level interventions that can support the well-being of women HCWs during a pandemic. <b>Design:</b> This scoping review is registered on Open Science Framework (OSF) and was guided by the JBI guide to scoping reviews and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) extension to scoping reviews. A systematic search of literature databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycInfo and ERIC) was conducted from inception until June 12, 2020. Two reviewers independently assessed full-text articles according to predefined criteria. <b>Interventions:</b> We included review articles and primary studies that reported on stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs; that primarily focused on women; and that included the percentage or number of women included. All English language studies from any geographical setting where COVID-19 has affected the population were reviewed. <b>Primary and secondary outcome measures:</b> Studies reporting on mental health outcomes (e.g., stress, burnout, and depression in HCWs), interventions to support mental health well-being were included. <b>Results:</b> Of the 2,803 papers found, 28 were included. The triggers of stress, burnout and depression are grouped under individual-, organizational-, and systems-level factors. There is a limited amount of evidence on effective interventions that prevents anxiety, stress, burnout and depression during a pandemic. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our preliminary findings show that women HCWs are at increased risk for stress, burnout, and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These negative outcomes are triggered by individual level factors such as lack of social support; family status; organizational factors such as access to personal protective equipment or high workload; and systems-level factors such as prevalence of COVID-19, rapidly changing public health guidelines, and a lack of recognition at work.","Sriharan, Ratnapalan, Tricco, Lupea, Ayala, Pang, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.596690","20211124","COVID-19; burnout; health care; health work force; mental health; occupational stress; pandemic; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22767,""
"Assessing Mental Health of Women Living in Karachi During the Covid-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> Women are more susceptible to mental health disorders and have been reported to experience higher levels of depression and anxiety during previous large-scale disease outbreaks. Stressful events like the COVID-19 pandemic can add extra burdens to women's already multifaceted lives. Keeping the gender implications of COVID-19 in mind can assist health care workers to offer more effective management. In our study, we aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of women in Karachi, Pakistan and investigate the possible risk factors. <b>Methods:</b> An online questionnaire was distributed to women on social media platforms in the month of June 2020. The questionnaire had two self-assessment scales, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scale which measures the symptoms of depression and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale which measures anxiety. <b>Results:</b> Three hundred and ninety three individuals completed the questionnaire with the mean age calculated to be 27.6 Ã‚Â± 11.7 years. Age, education, marital status, number of children, financial issues, employment status, smoking, comorbidities and mental illnesses were significantly associated with participants' mean anxiety and depression scores. The depression scores were generally higher compared to anxiety scores in each category. As the age increased, their scores decreased, with women aged 18-30 having a significantly higher mean depression and anxiety scores compared to women who were above 50. Severe anxiety was identified in 21.9% women and severe depression was noted in 17.8% women. A frightening number of 148 (37.7%) was found of women who had self-destructive thoughts at one time or another. Out of these women, surprisingly 97 (65.5%) individuals were not previously diagnosed with any mental illnesses. <b>Discussion:</b> This study supports the existing literature regarding the disturbed psychological state of women close to the peak of the covid-19 pandemic. We noted increased percentage of depressive women as compared to studies conducted before the covid-19 era. This raises concern especially with our thought provoking finding of self-harm or suicidal thoughts among women. Most of our female population is also seen to be anxious. This study highlights the importance for help and support groups of mental health to effectively reach women during this period of social isolation.","Asim, Ghani, Ahmed, Asim, Qureshi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.594970","20211124","COVID-19; Pakistan; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22768,""
"COVID-19 Significantly Affects Maternal Health: A Rapid-Response Investigation from Pakistan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still unfolding. Its several implications are visible, yet more of them we have to observe and witness in future. Dealing with these impacts, this rapid-response article aims to situate the COVID-19 pandemic within Pakistan's overall sociocultural and politico-economic context; next to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 particularly the psychological ones on pregnant women in Pakistan via five case. One case history of Haleema (pseudonym) revealed how the pandemic exerted a substantial amount of mental pressure due to ""arranging someone to accompany her to the hospital, finding a blood donor for her, and insecurity of convenience to hospital."" In this article, we show that Pakistan's geographical division into urban with an appropriate healthcare system, infrastructure and economic status, and more impoverished rural areas may show different impacts on people in general and the pregnant women in particular. This difference of facilities may contribute to disease transmission in the more deprived areas, that also due to cultural norms and mores such as shaking hands, cheek-kissing, and hugging that spread the virus are being overturned and that pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to psychological effects of the pandemic.","Ali, Sadique, Ali","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.591809","20211124","COVID-19; Pakistan; low- and lower-middle-income countries; mental health; pandemic; reproductive health; women; women's health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22769,""

For this purpose, we have used all papers available in PubMed between January and July 2020 as well as data from non-governmental associations. We have thus successively analyzed the situation of pregnancy during the pandemic; the specific psychological and psychiatric risks faced by women both as patients and as workers in the health sector, the increased risk of violence against women at home and at workplace and, finally the risk run by children within their families.

"Moving Forward From COVID-19: Bridging Knowledge Gaps in Maternal Health With a New Conceptual Model","As the world faces the health crisis of a global pandemic-with healthcare protocols in overhaul, and patients and care teams experiencing unprecedented levels of stress and unpredictability-we predict that current knowledge gaps in maternal health will inevitably have a lasting impact on the health of women giving birth now and in the near future. Since we are decades away from closing the knowledge gaps we need filled today, we recommend shifting thinking toward a comprehensive conceptual model that merges knowledge of stress physiology, neurobiology, and pregnancy physiology. The model we present here, the <i>Maternal Reactive Scope Model</i>, is an expansion of the Reactive Scope Model built upon the concept of Homeostasis and Allostasis. The model provides a framework to consider pathways and interactions across physiological systems to attribute a physiological basis for considering stress exposure and bridge research gaps on mechanisms to measure or target for treatment. Our intention is to provide an adaptable, heuristic framework for discussion of research considerations and new healthcare models that aim to provide the best care for new mothers during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dickens, Pawluski, Romero","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.586697","20211124","COVID-19; allostasis; maternal health; maternal mental health; pregnancy; pregnancy physiology; reactive scope model; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22771,""

Six hundred and thirty-eight volunteers completed an online survey (~30 min). <b>Main Outcome and Measures:</b> We first examined biological sex, gender, and sexual identity differences (both components of the ampler concept of gender) in sleep, empathy, and mood disturbances. Then, we assessed changes in sleep and mood over the course of the isolation period and tested for significant relationships between sleep variables, mood, and empathy. <b>Results:</b> We analyzed complete data for 573 participants (112 males and 459 females, 2 undisclosed, mean Ã‚Â± SD age = 25.9 Ã‚Â± 10.5 years, mean Ã‚Â± SD education = 16.2 Ã‚Â± 2.9 years). As compared to males, female participants reported lower quality of sleep, lower sleep efficiency, and greater symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and trauma. In addition, females reported higher scores than males on the IRI empathy scale and all its subcomponents. Similar results were found when stratifying by gender. Sleep and mood disturbances increased over the course of the isolation period in the whole sample. The most significant predictors of poor quality of sleep and insomnia were depression, anxiety, and trauma scores, especially in females; higher empathy trait was associated with higher depression, anxiety, and trauma scores, perhaps indicating a more positive role of fear and anxiety responses to the pandemic crisis. <b>Significance and Conclusions:</b> Sex and gender differences seem to play a role in the individuals' psychological and behavioral reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic.

"General Mental Health State Indicators in Argentinean Women During Quarantine of up to 80-Day Duration for COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Introduction:</b> Argentinean quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic is one of the most long-lasting worldwide. We focused on the first 80-days of this quarantine on Argentinean women. Our aims were to analyze differences in general mental health state (MHS) indicators, by the (1) sites of residence with different prevalence of COVID-19 cases, and (2) quarantine duration; (3) to assess multiple relationships between each general MHS indicator and potentially affecting factors. <b>Methods:</b> We used a cross-sectional design with convenience successive sampling (<i>N</i> = 5,013). The online survey included a socio-demographic questionnaire (elaborated <i>ad hoc</i>) with standardized and validated self-reported questionnaires (General Health Questionnaire, Kessler Psychological Distress Scale) measuring the MHS indicators: self-perceived health, psychological discomfort, social functioning and coping, and psychological distress. <b>Results:</b> Worse self-perceived health and higher psychological discomfort affected significantly more women residing in sites with high prevalence of COVID-19 cases, compared to those residing in sites with intermediate prevalence, but effect sizes were small. Mean scores of all general MHS indicators were significantly worse for longer quarantine sub-periods (up to 53, 68, and 80-day duration) than for shorter sub-periods (up to seven, 13, and 25-day duration). Being a younger age, having mental disorder history, and longer quarantine durations were associated to worsening MHS, while the lack of previous suicide attempt has a protective effect. <b>Discussion:</b> Our findings show that a worse MHS during quarantine may not be attributed to the objective risk of contagion (measured greater or less), and under quarantine, women MHS-as indicated by group central tendency measures-got worse as time went by. This strongly suggests that special attention needs to be paid to younger women and to women with history of mental disorder. Along with physical health, mental health must be a priority for the Government during and after quarantine and the COVID-19 pandemic.","LÃƒÂ³pez Steinmetz, Fong, Leyes, Dutto Florio, Godoy","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.580652","20211124","COVID-19; coping; coronavirus; psychological distress; quarantine; self-perceived health; social functioning; women's mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22773,""
"Postnatal Depression Risk Factors: An Overview of Reviews to Inform COVID-19 Research, Clinical, and Policy Priorities","The disruption of normal life due to the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to exacerbate extant risk factors for mental health problems. This may be particularly true for women who give birth during the crisis, especially those at risk for postnatal depression. Maternal postnatal depression has been identified as a public health issue with profound impacts on maternal and child well-being. Evidence from previous crises (e.g., earthquakes, terrorist attacks) has shown that crises significantly impact maternal mental health and some perinatal health outcomes. The aims of this paper were therefore to conduct a review to identify the established risk factors for maternal postnatal depression, and generate evidence-based hypotheses about whether the COVID-19 crisis would likely increase or decrease postnatal depression rates based on the identified risk factors. Several databases were searched during May-June 2020 for review papers (i.e., systematic reviews, meta-analyses, qualitative syntheses) using the following keywords: Depression, perinatal, postnatal, postpartum, systematic, review, predictors. Risk factors were extracted in conjunction with indicators for their strength of evidence (i.e., effect sizes, qualitative coding). Risk factors were critically evaluated in relation to their susceptibility to the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis. It was hypothesized that several health policies that were necessary to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., required restrictions) may be simultaneously impacting a range of these known risk factors and placing a larger number of women at heightened risk for postnatal depression. For instance, factors at a strong risk of being exacerbated include: Perceived low social support; exposure to traumatic events during or prior to pregnancy; significant life events occurring during pregnancy; and high stress associated with care of children. Future research and policy implications are discussed, including how policy makers could attempt to ameliorate the identified risk factors for postnatal depression following the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Doyle, Klein","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.577273","20211124","COVID-19; depression; pandemic; perinatal; postnatal; postpartum; review; systematic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22774,""
"COVID-19 and Women's Health: A Low- and Middle-Income Country Perspective","Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), a contagious disease, is a global pandemic affecting the lives and health of individuals across borders, genders and races. Much of what is known about the effects of natural disasters and disease outbreaks on women's health in particular, is based on studies conducted in high-income countries. The evolving evidence suggests that COVID-19 has a profound negative impact on the perinatal mental health of women. It is also clear that global pandemics such as COVID-19 disproportionately affect the less affluent, including individuals living in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of this review is to summarize and critically discuss extant knowledge on COVID-19 as it relates to the perinatal health of women in low and middle-income countries, using Pakistan as a case example. We specifically highlight the effects on perinatal mental health, preterm birth, and timing of the COVID-19 exposure. Our review suggests that it is essential to consider the effects of COVID-19 within this cultural context and that findings from high-income countries do not necessarily translate to the situation in low and middle-income countries.","Premji, Shaikh, Lalani, Yim, Moore, Ali, Aijaz, Letourneau","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.572158","20211124","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; low- and middle-income countries; mental health; pregnancy; preterm birth; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22775,""
"Are Pandemics Gender Neutral? Women's Health and COVID-19","In December 2019, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged as a health crisis in Wuhan, China, and was later declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. As it spread and its death toll increased, on the 11th of March 2020 it was declared a pandemic at 4,369 deaths worldwide, and cases and deaths have since surged. With gender disparities already known to leave women and their health at the margins of society during outbreaks, it is important to understand how COVID-19 affects women's health. In this article, we discuss how the COVID-19 pandemic can create vulnerabilities for women and their health and further exacerbate long-existing inequalities and social disparities. These include gender-based roles, economic and food security, violence, work pressure, and access to health and healthcare facilities. These issues have significant repercussions on the physical and mental health of women.

"Moms Are Not OK: COVID-19 and Maternal Mental Health","<b>Introduction:</b> Depression and anxiety affect one in seven women during the perinatal period, and are associated with increased risk of preterm delivery, reduced mother-infant bonding, and delays in cognitive/emotional development of the infant. With this survey we aimed to rapidly assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent physical distancing/isolation measures on the mental health and physical activity of pregnant and postpartum women. <b>Methods:</b> Between April 14 and May 8, 2020, we recruited women who were pregnant or within the first year after delivery to participate in an online survey. This included questionnaires on self-reported levels of depression/depressive symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Survey; EPDS), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory; STAI-State), and physical activity. Current and pre-pandemic values were assessed for each. <b>Results:</b> Of 900 eligible women, 520 (58%) were pregnant and 380 (42%) were in the first year after delivery. Sixty-four percent of women reported reduced physical activity with the onset of isolation measures, while 15% increased, and 21% had no change to their physical activity. An EPDS score &gt;13 (indicative of depression) was self-identified in 15% of respondents pre-pandemic and in 40.7% currently (mean Ã‚Â± SD; 7.5 Ã‚Â± 4.9 vs. 11.2 Ã‚Â± 6.3, respectively; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, moderate effect). Moderate to high anxiety (STAI-state score &gt;40) was identified in 29% of women before the pandemic (mean STAI = 34.5 Ã‚Â± 11.4) vs. 72% of women currently (mean STAI = 48.1 Ã‚Â± 13.6; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, large effect). However, women engaging in at least 150 min of moderate intensity physical activity (meeting current guidelines) during the pandemic had significantly lower scores for both anxiety and depression than those who did not (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01, large and small effect, respectively). <b>Discussion:</b> This rapid response survey identifies a substantial increase in the likelihood of maternal depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. This highlights the strong need for heightened assessment and treatment of maternal mental health. However, these data also suggest that physical activity, which has previously been shown to reduce depression and depressive symptoms in pregnancy, may be associated with better mental health during the pandemic.","Davenport, Meyer, Meah, Strynadka, Khurana","https://doi.org/10.3389/fgwh.2020.00001","20211124","COVID-19; mental health; physical activity; postpartum; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22778,""

A descriptive, cross-cutting, and exploratory study of the communication products for COVID-19 prevention published up to 28 February 2021 on official websites of the ministries of health of the 47 countries and territories of LAC. Quantitative and qualitative methods based on the dimensions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were employed, together with a social determinants of health (SDH) approach. The content analysis technique and investigator triangulation were used to improve internal validity. 3 253 information products were analyzed. In 47 countries and territories in LAC at least one product included a WHO recommendation; and in 46 at least one category or subcategory related to intermediate SDHs was addressed. Regarding structural SDHs, a gender approach was used in at least one product in only four countries, and an indigenous language in only seven countries. In 35 countries, at least one product was found to have erroneous information and in 13 countries the infodemic was not addressed. A substantial number of communication products for COVID-19 prevention were found, but they lacked an adequate diversity approach and comprehensive health approach, and they showed gaps and communication errors.

"Vulnerability pathways to mental health outcomes in children and parents during COVID-19","We examined pathways from pre-existing psychosocial and economic vulnerability to mental health difficulties and stress in families during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from two time points from a multi-cohort study initiated during the COVID-19 pandemic were used. Parents of children 6-18Ã‚Â years completed questionnaires on pre-COVID-19 socioeconomic and demographic factors in addition to material deprivation and stress due to COVID-19 restrictions, mental health, and family functioning. Youth 10Ã‚Â years and older also completed their own measures of mental health and stress. Using structural equation modelling, pathways from pre-existing vulnerability to material deprivation and stress due to COVID-19 restrictions, mental health, and family functioning, including reciprocal pathways, were estimated. Pre-existing psychosocial and economic vulnerability predicted higher material deprivation due to COVID-19 restrictions which in turn was associated with parent and child stress due to restrictions and mental health difficulties. The reciprocal effects between increased child and parent stress and greater mental health difficulties at Time 1 and 2 were significant. Reciprocal effects between parent and child mental health were also significant. Finally, family functioning at Time 2 was negatively impacted by child and parent mental health and stress due to COVID-19 restrictions at Time 1. Psychosocial and economic vulnerability is a risk factor for material deprivation during COVID-19, increasing the risk of mental health difficulties and stress, and their reciprocal effects over time within families. Implications for prevention policy and parent and child mental health services are discussed.

"Cognitive appraisal, Coping, Stress and Fear Contracting Covid-19 in Working People in Pakistan","The present study aimed to examine the relationship and prediction of cognitive appraisal and coping with Stress and Fear contracting COVID-19 among the working population of Pakistan. Cross-sectional research design was employed. The data was collected from 980 participants of almost 39 different professions using the purposive sampling technique. Stress Appraisal Measure (Peacock et al., in Stress Med 6:227-236, 1990, http://www.drpaulwong.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Stress-Appraisal-Measure-SAM-Peacock-Wong-1990-Paper.pdf). Brief COPE Inventory (Caver, in Int J Behav Med 4:92-100, 1997), and Perceived Stress Scale (Cohen et al., in J Health Soc Behav 24:385-396, 1983) were used to measure cognitive appraisal, coping, and stress, respectively. Fear was measured by using Fear contracting COVID-19 questionnaire (Ali et al., in J Pakistan Soc Int Med 2(2):140-144, 2021). Age, education, and previously attended stress management training were significantly positively correlated with stress and fear. Females were more stressed and fearful than males. Average time spent on social media was significantly positively correlated with stress. Participants, who were employed, had family members of the older age group above 50Ã‚Â years and had family members with the history of biological diseases were more fearful. Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that threat, centrality, stressfulness appraisal, and avoidant emotional coping significantly positively predicted stress, whereas control-self appraisal and active emotional coping significantly negatively predicted stress. Moreover, threat, challenge, centrality, stressfulness appraisal, and problem-focused coping significantly positively predicted fear contracting COVID-19, whereas control-self appraisal and active emotional coping significantly negatively predicted fear contracting COVID-19 after controlling for covariates. This study will address the administrative authorities and government institutions to provide first-aid mental health services for emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics in the future.","Ali, Khan, Abbas, Khan, Ullah","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10942-021-00433-z","20211124","COVID-19; Cognitive appraisal; Coping; Fear; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22781,""
"Relationship between stress and alexithymia, emotional processing and negative/positive affect in medical staff working amid the COVID-19 pandemic","The psychological burden of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting effect on emotional well-being of healthcare workers. Medical personnel working at the time of the pandemic may experience elevated occupational stress due to the uncontrollability of the virus, high perceived risk of infection, poor understanding of the novel virus transmission routes and unavailability of effective antiviral agents. This study used path analysis to analyze the relationship between stress and alexithymia, emotional processing and negative/positive affect in healthcare workers. The sample included 167 nurses, 65 physicians and 53 paramedics. Sixty-two (21.75 %) respondents worked in COVID-19-designated hospitals. Respondents were administered the Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale, Emotional Processing Scale, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule. The model showed excellent fit indices (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> (2)=2.642, p=0.267; CFI=0.999, RMSEA=0.034, SRMR=0.015).

"Association between food insecurity and major depressive episodes amid Covid-19 pandemic: results of four consecutive epidemiological surveys from southern Brazil","To assess the association between household food insecurity (FI) and major depressive episodes (MDE) amid Covid-19 pandemic in Brazil. Cross-sectional study carried out with data from four consecutive population-based studies. The study was conducted between May and June 2020, in BagÃƒÂ©, a Brazilian southern city. Household FI was measured using the short-form version of the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. Utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, we used two different approaches to define MDE: the cut-off point of Ã¢â€°Â¥9 and the diagnostic criteria proposed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-R). Association between FI and MDE was analysed using crude and adjusted Poisson regression models. 1550 adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥20 years old). The prevalence of household FI was 29.4% (95%C.I 25.0; 34.4). MDE prevalence varied from 4.4% (95%C.I. 3.1 to 6.0), when we used the DSM-IV-R criteria to define this condition, to 9.6% (95%C.I 7.3; 12.5) of the sample, when we used the cut-off point of Ã¢â€°Â¥9 as definition. Prevalence of MDE was more than two times higher in those individuals living with FI, independent of the criteria adopted to define the outcome. Adjustment for potential confounders did not change the association's magnitude. Household FI has been positively associated with MDE amid Covid-19 pandemic, independent of sociodemographic characteristics of participants. Actions are needed to warrant basic living conditions to avoid food insecurity and hunger and its consequences for the Brazilian population, especially those consequences linked to mental health disorders.","Santos, SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Meller, Crochemore-Silva, Nunes, Harter, Pellegrini, Loret de Mola","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980021004626","20211124","COVID-19; Depression; Food security; Mental health; Pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22783,""
"Network analysis of anxiety and depressive symptoms among quarantined individuals: cross-sectional study","The mental health burden of COVID-19 has been examined in different settings. Existing research has relied on the latent variable model in assessing COVID-19-related distress. Network theory provides an alternative framework wherein symptoms are conceptualised as causal, interconnected constituents rather than outcomes of mental disorders. To assess networks of self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms among quarantined individuals. Consenting individuals in different quarantine centres in Qatar completed the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale. We used partial correlation network methods to illustrate interactions of self-reported psychopathology. Participants with COVID-19 were significantly older and had a significantly higher proportion of males. The most central node was COVID-19, followed by thoughts of self-harm. COVID-19 status was strongly positively connected to thoughts of self-harm, which was positively connected to psychomotor changes, which were connected to decreased concentration. COVID-19 status was also positively connected to feeling anxious, which was strongly connected to inability to concentrate, which was connected to feeling afraid. COVID-19 was the most influential factor, with the highest number and strength of connections to psychopathology in a network of anxiety and depressive symptoms in a quarantine setting. Beyond the resolution of the infection, therapeutic interventions targeting psychomotor changes might prove beneficial in reducing suicidality among quarantined individuals with COVID-19. Follow-up with mental health services after COVID-19 infection is needed to restore psychological well-being. Further research is needed to understand the short- and long-term psychological effects of COVID-19, and the outcomes of different therapeutic interventions.","Abdul Karim, Ouanes, Reagu, Alabdulla","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.1060","20211124","COVID-19; Depressive disorders; anxiety disorders; network analysis; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22784,""
"Mental well-being, health, and locus of control in Danish adults before and during COVID-19","The aim of this study was to investigate possible impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on general health, mental well-being, and experiences of control compared to pre-pandemic populations. Our hypotheses were that we would observe a significant lower level of psychological wellbeing and general health in the 2020 sample compared to the prepandemic samples, and that we would observe younger age groups to be the most effected. Two representative Danish populations (2016, n=1656) and (2017, n=3366) were compared to a representative Danish population (n=1538) sampled during the first lockdown in May 2020. Two-tailed tests of proportions were used to investigate possible differences between samples in proportions reporting poorer mental well-being measured by WHO-5, general health, and internal locus of control. Younger men (aged 18 24) and younger women (aged 18 - 44) as well as elderly women (aged 65-74) reported lower mental well-being during the early phase of the pandemic compared to the population from 2016. Both women and men in 2020 to report significantly lower levels of internal locus of control compared to the 2017 sample. This was especially true for younger men and women. There were no statistically significant differences in general health between populations. This study partly supports the hypothesis that the the Covid-19 pandemic affected mental well-being negatively among younger persons. However, longitudinal studies are needed to investigate possible longterm effects of the pandemic on mental health and well-being. Further, qualitative studies are needed to investigate in-depth the consequenses of Covid-19.","WÃƒÂ¼rtzen, Clausen, Andersen, Santini, Erkmen, Pedersen","https://doi.org/10.1017/neu.2021.37","20211124","COVID-19; HEALTH; LOCUS OF CONTROL; MENTAL WELL-BEING; POPULATION STUDY","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22785,""
"Changes in young adults' mental well-being before and during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic: disparities between ethnic groups in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in substantial disruptions to the daily lives of young people. Yet knowledge is lacking about changes in mental well-being among young adults, whether those from ethnic minorities were more adversely impacted by the pandemic than the ethnic majority, and the extent to which pandemic-related stressors contributed to any declines in mental well-being. We draw on nationally representative German CILS4COVID data, collected early in the pandemic (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3517, M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°25). Respondents provided information on mental well-being (psychosomatic complaints, anxiety, depression, life satisfaction) and exposure to pandemic-related stressors (financial worries, health worries, discrimination, contact with COVID-19). Responses on mental well-being were matched to responses from two pre-pandemic waves. Individual fixed effects regressions examined ethnic group differences in changes in mental well-being prior to, and at the early stage of, the pandemic. Path analysis tested the role of pandemic-related stressors in declines in mental well-being. Overall, young adults' mental well-being had improved at the pandemic assessment compared to pre-pandemic assessments, and few ethnic group differences in changes were found. However, greater pandemic-related stressors were associated with worsened mental well-being at the pandemic assessment. Among Asian minorities, indirect effects were found on anxiety via health worries, and on depression via health worries and discrimination. For Turkish, Middle Eastern and African minorities, indirect effects on anxiety and depression were found via health worries. We did not find widespread declines in mental well-being among young adults at the early stage of the pandemic, and changes in mental well-being prior to and at the early stage of the pandemic were mostly similar across ethnic German and minority groups. Nevertheless, pandemic-related stressors posed risks for young adults' mental well-being, particularly increased discrimination and health worries among Asian minorities, and health worries among Turkish, Middle Eastern and African minorities.","Plenty, Bracegirdle, Dollmann, Spiegler","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-021-00418-x","20211124","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Discrimination; Ethnic/racial minority groups; Life satisfaction; Mental well-being; Psychosomatic complaints; Stressors; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22786,""
"Influence of new coronavirus pandemic on behavior and awareness of young nurses and nursing students in Japan","Although mental health disorders of health care workers in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have been focused, little is known about the psychological impact on nurses and the influence on their behavior and awareness, such as professionalism and views on life and death, in Japan where there are fewer cases of infection and deaths than in other countries. Moreover, the influence of the pandemic on nursing students is still unclear. An online questionnaire survey was conducted among nurses and nursing students. Feelings during the state of emergency (at the peak of the pandemic) in Japan, changes in behavior and awareness after the rise of COVID-19, and the associated factors influencing these changes were analyzed, comparing nurses with nursing students. Significantly increased scores of anxiety/fear (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) and voluntary restraint (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) and significantly decreased score of motivation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) were observed during the state of emergency in both nurses and students. Scores of experience of discrimination (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) and consideration of premature retirement (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01) were significantly increased in nurses. Moreover, preventive behavior (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005), lifestyle (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005), anxiety about nursing (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) and views on life and death (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) significantly changed after the rise of COVID-19 in both nurses and students. Only nurses reported significant damage to their professionalism (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01). Anxiety/fear and/or voluntary restraint and/or decreased motivation during the state of emergency were major factors associated with these changes. Also, the type of hospital, experience of care of infected patients and sex affected some of the changes. Voluntary restraint (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.008), increased preventive behavior (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.021) and decreased motivation (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.005) were more marked in nurses than in students, while change in views on life and death was greater in students than in nurses (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.002). The COVID-19 pandemic has had a psychological impact on nurses and nursing students, associated with changes in behavior and awareness even in Japan. Of note, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected nurses' professionalism and views on life and death. This study demonstrates the importance of having a coping strategy for anxiety and damaged professionalism in nurses, and education on life and death in nursing students.","Hasuike, Hara, Mori, Ideguchi, Shirai, Yoshimura, Murakami, Kawahata, Aoki, Ogihara","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-021-00724-x","20211124","Anxiety; COVID-19; Nurse; Nursing student; Professionalism; Questionnaire survey; Views on life and death","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22787,""
"Patient symptoms and experience following COVID-19: results from a UK-wide survey","To investigate the experience of people who continue to be unwell after acute COVID-19, often referred to as 'long COVID', both in terms of their symptoms and their interactions with healthcare. We conducted a mixed-methods analysis of responses to a survey accessed through a UK online post-COVID-19 support and information hub, between April and December 2020, about people's experiences after having acute COVID-19. 3290 respondents, 78% female, 92.1% white ethnicity and median age range 45-54 years; 12.7% had been hospitalised. 494(16.5%) completed the survey between 4 and 8 weeks of the onset of their symptoms, 641(21.4%) between 8 and 12 weeks and 1865 (62.1%) &gt;12 weeks after. The ongoing symptoms most frequently reported were: breathing problems (92.1%), fatigue (83.3%), muscle weakness or joint stiffness (50.6%), sleep disturbances (46.2%), problems with mental abilities (45.9%), changes in mood, including anxiety and depression (43.1%) and cough (42.3%). Symptoms did not appear to be related to the severity of the acute illness or to the presence of pre-existing medical conditions. Analysis of free-text responses revealed three main themes: (1) experience of living with COVID-19: physical and psychological symptoms that fluctuate unpredictably; (2) interactions with healthcare that were unsatisfactory; (3) implications for the future: their own condition, society and the healthcare system, and the need for research CONCLUSION: Consideration of patient perspectives and experiences will assist in the planning of services to address problems persisting in people who remain symptomatic after the acute phase of COVID-19.","Buttery, Philip, Williams, Fallas, West, Cumella, Cheung, Walker, Quint, Polkey, Hopkinson","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-001075","20211124","COVID-19; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22788,""

Two PHQ-9A screening strategies were evaluated: screening for any type of depression or other mental illness (positive on any item) or screening for major depressive disorder (MDD) (total score Ã¢â€°Â¥10). Overall, 56.4% of patients screened positive for any type of depression, 24.7% screened positive for MDD, and 21.1% screened positive for suicide risk. Regardless of PHQ-9A screening strategy, the ASQ identified additional subjects (eg, 2.2% additional cases compared with screening for any type of depression or other mental illness and 8.3% additional cases compared with screening positive for MDD). Of those with Ã¢â€°Â¥6 month follow-up, 22.9% screened positive for any type of depression (<i>n</i> = 205), 35.6% screened positive for MDD (<i>n</i> = 90), and 42.7% with a positive ASQ result (<i>n</i> = 75) had a depression or self-harm diagnosis or an antidepressant prescription. Suicide risk screening identifies cases not identified by depression screening. In this study, we underscore opportunities and challenges in primary care related to the high prevalence of depression and suicide risk. Research is needed regarding optimal screening strategies and to help clinicians manage the expected number of screening-identified adolescents.","Kemper, Hostutler, Beck, Fontanella, Bridge","https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-049999","20211124","Adolescent; Antidepressive Agents; COVID-19; Child; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Loneliness; Male; Mass Screening; Mental Disorders; Pandemics; Primary Health Care; Risk Factors; SARS-CoV-2; Social Isolation; Suicide; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-25","",22789,""
