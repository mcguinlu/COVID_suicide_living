"The mental health impact of COVID-19 racial and ethnic discrimination against Asian American and Pacific Islanders","Hate crimes against Asian American/ Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) have surged in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic to alarming new levels. We analyzed data from the Healthy Minds Study, and found that COVID-19 related racial/ethnic discrimination was associated with greater odds of having depression, anxiety, non-suicidal self-injury, binge drinking, and suicidal ideation among AAPI university students (N=1697). Findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic precipitated discrimination, which has been linked to mental health problems, calling for more preventive interventions to address the AAPI population, especially given their low rates of formal treatment utilization.","Sasha Zhou; Rachel Banawa; Hans Oh","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.06.21258177","20210609","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14696,""
"Depressive and anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-related factors among men and women in Nigeria","Despite the greater adverse economic impacts in low and middle-income (LAMI) compared to high-income countries, fewer studies have investigated the associations between COVID-19-related stressor and mental health in LAMI countries. The objectives of this study were to determine the associations between COVID-19-related stressors and anxiety and depressive symptoms while controlling for known risk and protective factors and to investigate any sex differences. An online survey was carried out to assess sociodemographic, psychosocial (previous mental health conditions, sexual orientation, intimate partner violence and perceived social support) and COVID-19-related variables. Hierarchical linear regression was carried out with anxiety and depressive symptoms as separate outcomes. Of the COVID-19-related factors, testing positive for COVID-19 infection, having COVID-19 symptoms, having other medical conditions, self-isolating due to COVID-19 symptoms, worry about infection, perception of the pandemic as a threat to income and isolation during the lockdown were significantly associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms. Of these, worry about infection, isolation during lockdown and disruption due to the pandemic retained independent associations with both outcomes. The variance in anxiety and depressive symptoms explained by COVID-19-related factors was larger in women (6.1% and respectively) compared to men (6.1% and respectively). COVID-19-related stressors are associated with higher anxiety and depressive symptoms, with these effects being larger in men compared to women. Enhancing social support can be an affordable strategy to mitigate this risk but this needs to be investigated using appropriate designs.","Olakunle Ayokunmi Oginni; Ibidunni O Oloniniyi; Olanrewaju Ibigbami; Victor Ugo; Ayomipo Amiola; Adedotun Ogunbajo; Oladoyin Esan; Aderopo Adelola; Oluwatosin Daropale; Matthew Ebuka; Boladale Mapayi","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.09.21258609","20210609","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14697,""
"The influence of sex, gender, age, and ethnicity on psychosocial factors and substance use throughout phases of the COVID-19 pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had profound physical and mental health effects on populations around the world. Limited empirical research has used a gender-based lens to evaluate the mental health impacts of the pandemic, overlooking the impact of public health measures on marginalized groups, such as women, and the gender diverse community. This study used a gender-based analysis to determine the prevalence of psychosocial symptoms and substance use by age, ethnicity, income, rurality, education level, Indigenous status, and sexual orientation. Participants in the study were recruited from previously established cohorts as a part of the COVID-19 Rapid Evidence Study of a Provincial Population-Based Cohort for Gender and Sex (RESPPONSE) study. Those who agreed to participate were asked to self-report symptoms of depression, anxiety, pandemic stress, loneliness, alcohol use, and cannabis use across five phases of the pandemic as well as retrospectively before the pandemic. For all psychosocial outcomes, there was a significant effect of time with all five phases of the pandemic being associated with more psychosocial symptoms relative to pre-COVID levels (p < .0001). Gender was significantly associated with all outcomes (p < .0001) with men exhibiting lower scores (i.e., less symptoms) than women and gender diverse participants, and women exhibiting lower scores than the gender diverse group. Other significant predictors were age (younger populations experiencing more symptoms, p < .0001), ethnicity (Chinese/Taiwanese individuals experiencing less symptoms, p = .005), and Indigenous status (Indigenous individuals experiencing more symptoms, p < .0001). Alcohol use and cannabis use increased relative to pre-pandemic levels, and women reported a greater increase in cannabis use than men (p < .0001). Our findings highlight the need for policy makers and leaders to proactively consider gender when tailoring public health measures for future pandemics.","Lori A.

"Post-Acute COVID Syndrome, the Aftermath of Mild to Severe COVID-19 in Brazilian Patients","Objective: To describe persistent symptoms after acute COVID-19 in different spectrum of disease severity in a population from an upper/middle income country, and identify the main clinical features impacting the quality of life. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Outpatient clinic from a public post-COVID-19 health center (CPC) at Bahia-Brazil, a state where 80% are black or mixed race. Participants: Patients admitted between August 2020 and February 2021 with symptoms at least one month after the onset of COVID-19. Main outcome measures: PACS and related disorders such as hospitalization one month or later after disease onset, biochemical dysregulation and reduced quality of life (EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). Results: Among 683 individuals assisted at CPC in this period, 602 were recruited. Patients had average of 52 ({+/-}14.6) years, 355 (59%) were female, 528 (88%) black/brown. Individuals were classified as mild (39.9%), moderate (27.9%) or severe (32.2%) during acute illness if outpatient, hospitalized non-UCI or UCI, respectively. Most patients reported a polysymptomatic profile, in median eight (IQR=6-9) acute symptoms. The most frequent residual symptoms were dyspnea (66%), fatigue (62%) and chest pain (43%). Women were more affected regardless disease severity at acute stage: presented more residual symptoms [4 (2-6) vs 3 (2-4)] and a higher impact in quality of life. Altered HbA1c [(184/275 (66.9%)], high CRP levels [195/484 (40.3%)] and anemia [143/545 (26.2%)] were the most common abnormalities in laboratory exams. 76 patients presented HbA1c above 6.4% although only 42 referred previous diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. After one month of disease onset, 30 patients required hospitalization, including seven cases with mild acute illness. Hospital admission after acute disease was required on 30 patients, seven (23%) were mild. Quality of life had been affected for 357/404 (88.4%) patients according to EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L), mainly the domains of anxiety/depression [severe or extreme anxiety for 79/401 (19.7%)] and pain/discomfort [severe or extreme pain for 71/403 (17.6%)]. The median EuroQoL Global Score was 70 [IQR 50-80]. PACS symptoms such as dyspnea, chest pain, and fatigue, was associated with decreased quality of life. Conclusions: PACS, such as dyspnea, chest pain and fatigue, occurred after variable degree of disease severity. Among this majority black/mixed-race patients, woman seemed to be more affected. Other consequences included post-acute hospitalization, and abnormal glucose metabolism and reduced quality of life.","Ana Paula Andrade Barreto; Lucimeire Cardoso Duarte; Thiago Cerqueira-Silva; Marcio Andrade Barreto Filho; Aquiles Camelier; Natalia Machado Tavares; Manoel Barral-Netto; Viviane Sampaio Boaventura; Marcelo Chalhoub; - CPC Group Study","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.07.21258520","20210609","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14699,""

"Advancing Mental Health and Psychological Support for Health Care Workers Using Digital Technologies and Platforms","COVID-19 pandemic has been a global public health crisis, which has not only endangered the lives of patients, but also resulted in increased psychological issues to medical professionals, especially front-line health care workers (HCWs). As the crisis caused by the pandemic shifts from acute to protracted, attention should be paid to the devastating impacts on HCWs' mental health and social well-being. Digital technologies are being harnessed to support the responses to the pandemic, which provide opportunities to advance mental health and psychological support for HCWs. To develop a framework to describe and organize the mental health and psychological issues that HCWs are facing during the pandemic. Based on the framework, this study also proposed interventions from digital health perspectives, which HCWs could leverage during and after the pandemic. The psychological problems and mental health issues that HCWs have been encountered during the COVID-19 pandemic were reviewed and analyzed based on the proposed MEET (Mental health, Environment, Event, and Technology) framework, which also demonstrated the interactions of the mental health, digital interventions, and social support. HCWs are facing increased risks of mental health issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, including burnout, fear, worry, distress, pressure, anxiety, and depression. These negative emotional stressors may cause psychological problems for HCWs and affect their physical and mental health. Digital technologies and platforms are playing pivotal roles in mitigating psychological issues and providing effective support. The proposed MEET framework could provide structured guidelines for further studies on how technology interacts with mental and psychological health for different populations. The COVID-19 pandemic presents unprecedented challenges due to prolonged uncertainty, immediate threat to patient safety, and evolving professional demands. It is urgent to protect the mental health and strengthen the psychological resilience of HCWs. Given the pandemic will exist for a long time, caring for mental health has been a new normal, which needs a strengthened multi-sector collaboration to facilitate the support and reduce health disparities. The proposed framework could enable a better understanding of how to mitigate the psychological effects during the pandemic, recover from associated experiences, and provide comprehensive institutional and societal infrastructures for HCWs' well-being.","Ye","https://doi.org/10.2196/22075","20210609","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14701,""
"Analysis of psychological status and effect of psychological intervention in quarantined population during the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2","During outbreaks of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), many countries adopted quarantine to slow the spread of the virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Quarantine will cause isolation from families, friends, and the public, which consequently leads to serious psychological pressure with potentially long-lasting effects on the quarantined population. Experience of specific practices to improve the psychological status of the mandatory quarantined population was limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological impact of mandatory quarantine, and evaluate the effect of psychological intervention on the quarantined population.We conducted a prospective cohort study to assess and manage the psychological status of a mandatory quarantined population in Beijing, China. A total of 638 individuals completed 2 questionnaires and were enrolled in this study, of which 372 participants accepted designed psychological intervention while other 266 participants refused it. The SCL-90 questionnaire was used to evaluate the psychological status and its change before and after the intervention. The differences of SCL-90 factor scores between participants and the national norm group were assessed by 2 samples t test. While the SCL-90 factor scores before and after intervention were compared with 2 paired samples t test.Compared with the Chinese norms of SCL-90, the participants had higher SCL-90 factor scores in most items of the SCL-90 inventory. The SCL-90 factor scores of participants with psychological intervention significantly decreased in somatization, obsessive-compulsive, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism. In contrast, most factor scores of the SCL-90 inventory changed little without statistical significance in participants without psychological intervention.Psychological problems should be emphasized in the quarantined individuals and professional psychological intervention was a feasible approach to improve the psychological status of the mandatory quarantined population in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2.","Wu, Zhou, Wu, Zhao, Shang, Gao, Rao, Jiao, Xi","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000025951","20210609","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14702,""

"[Debate on the return to face-to-face classes in Pandemic]","The implications of closing educational establishments during the COVID-19 pandemic and the dis cussion about the opening of them, invite and require us to consider, from different positions and responsibilities, the changes that we must make as a society at the educational level. In this article, a group of health professionals collects information and reflects on the repercussions of returning or not to school activities, in terms of physical and emotional health and academic education. Based on what is known to be protective factors and possible threats to return, it is possible to conclude that each local reality must make its own informed decision, with the participation of all its members, seeking the common good, which favors students, protects teachers, and privileges the role of the educational system in socio-emotional learning. School is a space for containing the emotions and adaptation needs that students and their families have experienced in these uncertain times. We all have a level of responsibility in building a new civilization around these issues that link education, physical and mental health, social collaboration, and individual responsibility.

"Building Primary-School Children's Resilience through a Web-Based Interactive Learning Environment: Quasi-Experimental Pre-Post Study","Resilience is a person's mental ability to deal with challenging situations adaptively and is a crucial stress management skill. Psychological resilience and finding ways to cope in crises is a highly relevant topic considering the COVID-19 pandemic, which enforced quarantine, social distancing measures, and school closures worldwide. Parents and children are currently living with increased stress due to COVID-19. We need to respond with immediate ways to strengthen children's resilience. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for children's stress management overcome accessibility issues such as the inability to visit mental health experts owing to COVID-19 movement restrictions. An interactive learning environment was created, based on the preventive program &quot;Friends,&quot; to overcome accessibility issues associated with delivering cognitive behavioral therapy-based interventions in formal and informal education settings. This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a web-based learning environment on resilience in (1) reducing anxiety symptoms and (2) increasing emotion recognition and recognition of stress management techniques among 9-10-year-old children. We also aimed to evaluate the learning environment's usability. A quasi-experimental pretest-posttest control group design was used. In total, 20 fourth graders in the experimental group interacted with the learning environment over 6 weekly 80-minute sessions. Further, 21 fourth graders constituted the control group. The main data sources were (1) a psychometric tool to measure children's anxiety symptoms, namely the Greek translation of the original Spence Children's Anxiety Scale, (2) 3 open-ended questions assessing emotion recognition and recognition of stress management techniques, and (3) the System Usability Scale to measure the usability of the learning environment. In both groups, there was a small but nonsignificant postintervention reduction in reported anxiety symptoms, except for obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms in the experimental group. A paired samples t test revealed that students' reported symptom scores of obsessive-compulsive disorder significantly decreased from 1.06 (SD 0.68) to 0.76 (SD 0.61) (t<sub>19</sub>= 5.16; P=.01). The experimental group revealed a significant increase in emotion recognition (t<sub>19</sub>=-6.99; P&lt;.001), identification of somatic symptoms of stress (t<sub>19</sub>=-7.31; P&lt;.001), and identification of stress management techniques (t<sub>19</sub>=-6.85; P&lt;.001). The learning environment received a satisfactory usability score. The raw average system usability score was 76.75 (SD 8.28), which is in the 80th percentile rank and corresponds to grade B. This study shows that interactive learning environments might deliver resilience interventions in an accessible and cost-effective manner in formal education, potentially even in distance-learning conditions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic. Interactive learning environments on resilience are also valuable tools for parents who can use them with their children at home, for informal learning, using mobile devices. As such, they could be a promising first-step, low-intensity intervention that children and the youth can easily access.","Nicolaidou, Stavrou, Leonidou","https://doi.org/10.2196/27958","20210609","COVID-19; interactive learning environment; internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy; parents; prevention intervention; primary school children; psychological resilience; teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14705,""
"Consumer Views on Health Applications of Consumer Digital Data and Health Privacy Among US Adults: Qualitative Interview Study","In 2020, the number of internet users surpassed 4.6 billion. Individuals who create and share digital data can leave a trail of information about their habits and preferences that collectively generate a digital footprint. Studies have shown that digital footprints can reveal important information regarding an individual's health status, ranging from diet and exercise to depression. Uses of digital applications have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic where public health organizations have utilized technology to reduce the burden of transmission, ultimately leading to policy discussions about digital health privacy. Though US consumers report feeling concerned about the way their personal data is used, they continue to use digital technologies. This study aimed to understand the extent to which consumers recognize possible health applications of their digital data and identify their most salient concerns around digital health privacy. We conducted semistructured interviews with a diverse national sample of US adults from November 2018 to January 2019. Participants were recruited from the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, a nationally representative panel. Participants were asked to reflect on their own use of digital technology, rate various sources of digital information, and consider several hypothetical scenarios with varying sources and health-related applications of personal digital information. The final cohort included a diverse national sample of 45 US consumers. Participants were generally unaware what consumer digital data might reveal about their health. They also revealed limited knowledge of current data collection and aggregation practices. When responding to specific scenarios with health-related applications of data, they had difficulty weighing the benefits and harms but expressed a desire for privacy protection. They saw benefits in using digital data to improve health, but wanted limits to health programs' use of consumer digital data. Current privacy restrictions on health-related data are premised on the notion that these data are derived only from medical encounters. Given that an increasing amount of health-related data is derived from digital footprints in consumer settings, our findings suggest the need for greater transparency of data collection and uses, and broader health privacy protections.","Grande, Luna Marti, Merchant, Asch, Dolan, Sharma, Cannuscio","https://doi.org/10.2196/29395","20210609","digital epidemiology; digital health privacy; health law; health privacy; privacy law","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14706,""
"Senior Centers and LGBTQ Participants: Engaging older adults virtually in a pandemic","Upon the outbreak of Covid-19, recommendations to cease all non-essential in person services were mandated across the United States to prevent transmission to non-infected individuals. As a result, approximately 96% of all senior centers in the United States were closed to in-person programming. Senior centers have had a long history of engaging older adults, maintaining community connections, enhancing social support and reducing social isolation. SAGE, the first publicly funded senior center for LGBT older adults in the US, serves a traditionally under-served population with a vast array of services and programs. This exploratory, cross-sectional study utilized an online survey to evaluate the experiences of 113 SAGE members after the Coronavirus pandemic closed their senior center. Participants reported a relatively easy adaptation to technology, steady participation in programs and services, satisfaction with virtual senior center programming and a stable sense of engagement with their peers. Higher levels of engagement with senior center programs was associated with stronger feelings of social support. Additionally, stronger perceptions of social support and participation in exercise and fitness programming were associated with higher life satisfaction and lower depression and anxiety.

"Validity and reliability study of coronavirus-related psychiatric symptom scale in children - parental form","The aim of this study is to develop a scale to assess the psychiatric symptoms that may emerge owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic period in children and adolescents aged 4-18 years. To develop the scale, first, interviews with children, adolescents, and their parents were conducted, and the possible psychiatric symptom clusters were detected. The items were written with reference to the literature and reviewed by the experts. A 40-item scale form was shared as an online survey, and a factor analysis of the scale was carried out with data obtained from 441 participants. The test-retest reliability of the scale was carried out with data obtained from the 51 participants who filled the scale again after 14 days. According to the item-total correlations and factor analysis results with 40 items, 5 items with low correlation and factor load or loaded same under the two factors were removed from the scale. The final form had 35 items and had a two-factor structure. The internal consistency coefficient of the scale was calculated as 0.96, and the test-retest correlation coefficient was 0.98. Coronavirus-related psychiatric symptom scale in children - parental form is a valid and reliable scale for measuring perceived psychiatric symptoms associated with COVID-19pandemic in children aged 4-18 years by their parents.","HesapÃƒÂ§Ã„Â±oÃ„Å¸lu, Karahan, Tural, EmiralioÃ„Å¸lu","https://doi.org/10.5152/TurkArchPediatr.2021.20256","20210609","Anxiety; child; coronavirus; depressive symptoms; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14711,""
"Unexpected acute pulmonary embolism in an old COVID-19 patient with warfarin overdose: a case report","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 disease is strongly associated with a high incidence of thrombotic events. Anticoagulation could be a cornerstone in successfully managing severe forms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, optimal anticoagulant dosing in elderly patients is challenging because of high risk of both thrombosis and bleeding. We present here the case of an 89-year-old patient receiving warfarin for atrial fibrillation and valvular heart disease, admitted to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure due to COVID-19. The patient presented with a severe epistaxis associated with warfarin overdose [international normalized ratio (INR)Ã¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10]. After a successful initial reversal using vitamin K <i>per os</i>, INR values greatly fluctuated up to 10, requiring repeated administrations of vitamin K. Despite starting low-molecular-weight heparin therapy at therapeutic dose as soon as INR value was below 2.0, the patient further developed an acute bilateral and proximal pulmonary embolism concomitantly with a sharp D-dimer increase. The combination of azithromycin intake, a known inhibitor of CYP2C9, with the presence of <i>CYP2C9*2</i> and <i>-1639G&gt;A VKORC1</i>, two variants associated with warfarin hypersensitivity, have likely contributed to explain the warfarin overdose and the difficulty to reverse warfarin effect in this patient. This case report illustrates the complexity of COVID-19 pathophysiology and its management for physicians, especially in patients receiving vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). Infection, concurrent medication use, and pharmacogenetic factors involved in VKA metabolism and pharmacodynamics may lead to a loss of control of anticoagulation. Pulmonary embolism should still be considered in COVID-19 patients even with effective or overdosed anticoagulant therapy.","Coutrot, Delrue, Joly, Siguret","https://doi.org/10.1093/ehjcr/ytab206","20210609","COVID-19; Case report; D-dimer; Overdose; Pulmonary embolism; Warfarin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14712,""
"Hypofractionation and Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in Inoperable Locally Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer","Radiotherapy (RT) plays a key role in the control of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC). Throughout the years, different doses and fractionations of RT have been used in an attempt to optimize the results. Recently, special interest has been given to hypofractionation (hypoRT) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). HypoRT is a relatively widespread treatment, although the accompanying level of evidence is limited. For its part, SBRT has been used specially to overdose specific areas of the disease as a boost after radiochemotherapy. In both cases, the study of how to integrate these RT tools with chemotherapy and immunotherapy is fundamental. In addition, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic situation has sparked increased interest in hypofractionated treatments. In this review, we analyze the role of SBRT and hypoRT in the management of LA-NSCLC in accordance with current scientific evidence. The objective of this article is to introduce professionals to the role that hypoRT and SBRT can play in the treatment of LA-NSCLC to offer the best treatment to their patients.","Rico, MartÃƒÂ­nez, RodrÃƒÂ­guez, Rosas, Barco, MartÃƒÂ­nez","https://www.google.com/search?q=Hypofractionation+and+Stereotactic+Body+Radiation+Therapy+in+Inoperable+Locally+Advanced+Non-small+Cell+Lung+Cancer.","20210609","hypofractionation; non-small-cell lung cancer; radiotherapy; stereotactic body radiation therapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14713,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Health and Well-being of Informal Caregivers of People with Dementia: A Rapid Systematic Review","<b>Background:</b> In December 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), or COVID-19, raised worldwide concern. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively influenced health and wellness across the globe and caused nearly three million deaths. This study focuses on informal caregivers of people with dementia, a disease that affects about 50Ã¢â‚¬â€°million older adults worldwide and requires much caregiving support. <b>Objective</b>: Examine the current literature on the impact of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of informal caregivers for people with dementia. <b>Method</b>: This rapid review was conducted across five electronic databases for quantitative and qualitative articles published through March 15, 2021. <b>Results</b>: The 10 studies included in this review reported quantitative descriptive data from across the globe; however, no studies existed from the U.S. or East Asia countries. All of the studies examined the psychological rather than physical impact of COVID-19 and highlighted risk and protective factors in the areas of psychosocial (resilience, neuropsychiatric, and social isolation), sociodemographic (gender and education), and environmental (home confinement, living arrangement, and dementia stage). <b>Conclusion</b>: COVID-19 has had a considerable negative impact on the psychological well-being of informal caregivers of people with dementia, namely causing more depression and anxiety than pre-pandemic.","Hughes, Liu, Baumbach","https://doi.org/10.1177/23337214211020164","20210609","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s/dementia; active life/physical activity; caregiving and management; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14714,""

However, the relationship between COVID-19 and male sexual activity did not yet get much consideration. Herein, we report the impact of COVID-19 on sexual function in 3 men who recovered from the disease. Compared with their condition before catching the infection, the men showed, in different degrees, a decline in all aspects of sexual function as assessed by the international index of erectile function. They started to develop premature ejaculation or exacerbate an already existing condition according to the premature ejaculation diagnostic tool scoring. Beck's depression inventory revealed deterioration of the men's moods up to severe depression. The sex-related hormones (testosterone-total and free, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, prolactin, and estradiol) of these men were within normal levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting deleterious changes in mood and several aspects of sexual functioning in males after recovery from the COVID-19 using validated measurement tools. Follow-up and psychological support of the recovered men may help mend their moods and consequently upgrade their sexual functioning.","Salama, Blgozah","https://doi.org/10.1177/11795476211020593","20210609","COVID-19; depression; premature ejaculation; sexual dysfunction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14717,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated with Insomnia Symptoms Among the Chinese General Public After the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Epidemic Was Initially Controlled","The prevalence rate and related factors of insomnia remained unknown after the COVID-19 epidemic had been under control. Therefore, we conducted this survey to investigate the prevalence rate and related factors of insomnia symptoms in the Chinese general public after the COVID-19 had been initially control. An online survey was conducted among Chinese citizens through the JD Health APP. The questionnaire was used for collecting demographic data and self-designed questions related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Insomnia Severity Index, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Somatic Symptom Scale-8 and Impact of Events Scale-Revised were used for measuring psychological symptoms. To examine the associations of sociodemographic and psychological factors with insomnia symptoms, a binary logistic regression was used. In total, there were 14,894 eligible participants, and 4601 (30.9%) participants were found to have insomnia symptoms. The regression model revealed that a higher risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with being over the age of 40 years, having history of psychiatric disorders, smoking, having infected friends or colleagues, having depressive or somatic symptoms, experiencing psychological distress and feeling estranged from family members. Meanwhile a lower risk of insomnia symptoms was associated with being female, having closer family relationships, not feeling alienated from others and being satisfied with the available information. In our study, 30.9% of the participants in the general public reported insomnia symptoms after the COVID-19 epidemic had been initially controlled. When providing precise interventions for insomnia, extra attention should be paid to the individuals who are male, elderly and smokers, and those with psychiatric disorder history, with infected friends or colleagues, with psychological symptoms and with poor social support.","Guo, Yang, Xu, Zhang, Luo, Liu, Yao, Bai, Zong, Zhang, Liu, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S307996","20210609","COVID-19; China; general public; insomnia symptoms; prevalence; under control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14718,""
"Mental Disorders of Bangladeshi Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic has become a global burden disrupting peoples' quality of life. Students being an important cohort of a country, their mental health during this pandemic has been recognized as a concerning issue. Therefore, the prevalence and associated risk factors of Bangladeshi students' mental health sufferings (ie, depression, anxiety, and stress) are systematically reviewed herein for the first time. Adhering to the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was performed from 1 to 5 April, 2021 in several databases including PubMed; and finally, a total of 7 articles were included to this review. The prevalence rates of mild to severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress ranged from 46.92% to 82.4%, 26.6% to 96.82%, and 28.5% to 70.1%, respectively. The risk factors concerning mental health problems included the factors related to (i) socio-demographic (younger age, gender, lower educational grade, urban residence, family size, currently living with family/parents, and having children in the family), (ii) behavior and health (smoking status, lack of physical exercise, more internet browsing time, and dissatisfaction with sleep), (iii) COVID-19 pandemic- (COVID-19 related symptoms, COVID-19 related perceptions, and fear of COVID-19 infection), (iv) miscellaneous (losing part-time teaching job, lack of study concentration, agitation, fear of getting assaulted or humiliated on the way to the hospital or home, financial problems, academic dissatisfaction, inadequate food supply, higher exposure to COVID-19 social and mass media, engaging with more recreational activities, and performing more household chores). The overall assumption of mental disorders' prevalence rates can be regarded as problematic to this cohort. Thus, the authorities should consider setting up possible strategies to diminish the pandemic effect on students' mental health.","Al Mamun, Hosen, Misti, Kaggwa, Mamun","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S315961","20210609","COVID-19 and psychological impact; anxiety; depression; pandemic in Bangladesh; prevalence and risk factors; stress; student mental health in Bangladesh; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14719,""
"Post-COVID symptoms reported at asynchronous virtual review and stratified follow-up after COVID-19 pneumonia","The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems and how best to address post-COVID health needs is uncertain. Here we describe the post-COVID symptoms of 675 patients followed up using a virtual review pathway, stratified by severity of acute COVID infection. COVID-19 survivors completed an online/telephone questionnaire of symptoms after 12+ weeks and a chest radiograph. Dependent on findings at virtual review, patients were provided information leaflets, attended for investigations and/or were reviewed face-to-face. Outcomes were compared between patients following high-risk and low-risk admissions for COVID pneumonia, and community referrals. Patients reviewed after hospitalisation for COVID pneumonia had a median of two ongoing physical health symptoms post-COVID. The most common was fatigue (50.3% of high-risk patients). Symptom burden did not vary significantly by severity of hospitalised COVID pneumonia but was highest in community referrals. Symptoms suggestive of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder were common (depression occurred in 24.9% of high-risk patients). Asynchronous virtual review facilitated triage of patients at highest need of face-to-face review. Many patients continue to have a significant burden of post-COVID symptoms irrespective of severity of initial pneumonia. How best to assess and manage long COVID will be of major importance over the next few years.","Taylor, Trivedi, Patel, Singh, Ricketts, Elliott, Yarwood, White, Hylton, Allen, Thomas, Kapil, McGuckin, Pfeffer","https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2021-0037","20210609","breathlessness; depression; follow-up; long COVID; sequalae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14720,""

"Impact of COVID-19 on the mental health of US college students","In the beginning of 2020, the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, became a public health emergency in the U.S. and rapidly escalated into a global pandemic. Because the SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, physical distancing was enforced and indoor public spaces, including schools and educational institutions, were abruptly closed and evacuated to ensure civilian safety. Accordingly, educational institutions rapidly transitioned to remote learning. We investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on domestic U.S. college students, ages 18-24Ã‚Â years. Through PollfishÃ‚Â®'s survey research platform, we collected data from 200 domestic U.S. college students in this age range (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°200) regarding the physical, emotional, and social impacts of COVID-19 as well as key background information (e.g. whether or not they are first-generation or if they identify with the LGBTQIA+ community). Our results indicate that students closer to graduating faced increases in anxiety (60.8%), feeling of loneliness (54.1%), and depression (59.8%). Many reported worries for the health of loved ones most impacted their mental health status (20.0%), and the need to take care of family most affected current and future plans (31.8%). Almost one-half of students took to exercising and physical activity to take care of their mental health (46.7%). While a third did not have strained familial relationships (36.5%), almost one half did (45.7%). A majority found it harder to complete the semester at home (60.9%), especially among those who had strained relationships with family (34.1%). Seventy percent spent time during the pandemic watching television shows or movies. Significantly more men, first-generation, and low-income students gained beneficial opportunities in light of the pandemic, whereas their counterparts reported no impact. First-generation students were more likely to take a gap year or time off from school. Although students found ways to take care of themselves and spent more time at home, the clear negative mental health impacts call for schools and federal regulations to accommodate, support, and make mental health care accessible to all students.","Lee, Solomon, Stead, Kwon, Ganti","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-021-00598-3","20210609","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Loneliness; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14722,""

"Using Fear and Anxiety Related to COVID-19 to Predict Cyberchondria: Cross-sectional Survey Study","Studies have highlighted that fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 are important psychological factors that affect all populations. There currently remains a lack of research on specific amplification factors regarding fear and anxiety in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite established associations between anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, and cyberchondria, empirical data investigating the associations between these three variables, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, are currently lacking. Urgent research is needed to better understand the role of repeated media consumption concerning COVID-19 in amplifying fear and anxiety related to COVID-19. This study investigated the associations between fear of COVID-19, COVID-19 anxiety, and cyberchondria. Convenience sampling was used to recruit respondents to participate in an online survey. The survey, which was distributed via social media and academic forums, comprised the Cyberchondria Severity Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, Anxiety Sensitivity Index, and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. Multiple mediation analyses were conducted using structural equation modeling. A total of 694 respondents (males: n=343, females: n=351) completed the online survey. The results showed that fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 predicted cyberchondria (fear: ÃŽÂ²=.39, SE 0.04, P&lt;.001, t=11.16, 95% CI 0.31-0.45; anxiety: ÃŽÂ²=.25, SE 0.03, P&lt;.001, t=7.67, 95% CI 0.19-0.32). In addition, intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between fear and anxiety generated by COVID-19 with cyberchondria. In a reciprocal model, the standardized total effects of cyberchondria on fear of COVID-19 (ÃŽÂ²=.45, SE 0.04, P&lt;.001, t=15.31, 95% CI 0.39-0.51) and COVID-19 anxiety (ÃŽÂ²=.36, SE 0.03, P&lt;.001, t=11.29, 95% CI 0.30-0.41) were statistically significant, with moderate effect sizes. Compared to males, females obtained significantly higher scores for cyberchondria (t<sub>1,692</sub>=-2.85, P=.004, Cohen d=0.22), COVID-19 anxiety (t<sub>1,692</sub>=-3.32, P&lt;.001, Cohen d=0.26), and anxiety sensitivity (t<sub>1,692</sub>=-3.69, P&lt;.001, Cohen d=0.29). The findings provide a better understanding of the role of COVID-19 in amplifying cyberchondria. Based on these results, cyberchondria must be viewed as a significant public health issue. Importantly, increasing awareness about cyberchondria and online behavior at both the individual and collective levels must be prioritized to enhance preparedness and to reduce the adverse effects of current and future medical crises.","Wu, Nazari, Griffiths","https://doi.org/10.2196/26285","20210609","COVID-19; COVID-19 anxiety; COVID-19 fear; SEM; anxiety; anxiety sensitivity; cyberchondria; intolerance of uncertainty; mental health; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14724,""

Survey data from a sample of 1595 Chinese adolescents and their parents were subjected to path analysis. The results indicated that stressful events of the COVID-19 epidemic were significantly positively associated with adolescentsâ€™ suicidal ideation, and this association was mediated by depression. In addition, adolescentsâ€™ parental educational involvement significantly moderated the path from depression to suicidal ideation. These results highlight the importance of identifying the underlying key mechanisms that moderate the mediated paths between stressful events and adolescentsâ€™ suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 epidemic. The findings also provide implications for parents and education staff regarding the importance of improving parental educational involvement to prevent adolescentsâ€™ suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 epidemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2021.106047","20210801","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14725,""

"Ecological momentary assessment as a measurement tool in depression trials","We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to track symptoms during a clinical trial. Thirty-six participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and MADRS scores =20 were enrolled in a nonrandomized 6-week open-label trial of commercially available antidepressants. Twice daily, a mobile device prompted participants to self-report the 6 items of the HamD6 sub-scale derived from the Hamilton rating scale for depression (HamD17). Morning EMA reports asked â€œhow do you feel nowâ€ whereas evening reports gathered a full-day impression. Clinicians who were blinded to the EMA data rated the MADRS, HamD17 and HamD6 at screen, baseline and weeks 2,4, and 6. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) examined the course of the EMA assessments and convergence between EMA scores and clinician ratings. HLM analyses revealed strong correlations between AM and PM EMA derived HamD6 scores and revealed significant improvements over time. EMA improvements were significantly correlated with the clinician rated HamD6 scores at endpoint and predicted clinician rated HamD6 score changes from baseline to endpoint (p < .001). There was a large correlation between EMA and clinician derived HamD6 scores at each in-person assessment after baseline. Treatment response defined by EMA matched the clinician rated HamD6 treatment responses in 33 of 36 cases (91.7%). EMA derived symptom scores appear to be efficient and valid measures to track daily symptomatic change in clinical trials and may provide more accurate measures of symptom severity than the episodic â€œsnapshotsâ€ that are currently used as clinical outcomes. These findings support further investigation of EMA for assessment in clinical trials.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.02.012","20210401","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-10","",14727,""
