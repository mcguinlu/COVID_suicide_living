"Acute respiratory distress syndrome","Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous lung disease that is triggered by pulmonary and non-pulmonary pathologies. It predominantly causes hypoxaemic respiratory failure and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Although ARDS remains underdiagnosed, 24% of mechanically ventilated patients in intensive care units and 33% of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients admitted to the hospital are reported to have ARDS. Despite recent advances in treatment, mortality remains at more than 30% for all ARDS patients and 43% for severe ARDS. The pathophysiology is complex and involves acute pulmonary and systemic inflammation, alveolar oedema, and de-recruitment which lead to ventilation-perfusion mismatch, reduced lung compliance and hypoxaemia. Similarities in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 ARDS outnumber differences from non-COVID-19 ARDS. Inhomogeneous distribution of transpulmonary pressure variation throughout the lungs in ARDS increases the risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury and ventilator-associated lung injury. Stratifying ARDS patients as per Berlin definition can help to recognize ARDS early, identify resource requirements and plan appropriate management. Treating the underlying cause, lung-protective ventilation and supportive care are the mainstays of clinical management. Multiple rescue therapies, novel treatments, and methods of facilitating individualized ventilation have been described but many require further validation;and appropriate patient selection is warranted.","Parikh aka Parmar, Tapan, Pilcher, David","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2022.07.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38772,""
"Hybrid Pain Management Strategy Attenuated Acute Pain and Reduced Left-Over Opioid Doses","Problem: Clinicians treating postprocedure acute pain after third molar removal face a twofold challenge: attenuating pain levels while simultaneously limiting leftover opioid doses. Strategies for achieving the dual goals range from â€œletting patients decide,â€ which can lead to leftover doses and misuse, or â€œletting clinicians decide,â€ only prescribing opioids for those predicted to experience severe discomfort, which risks under-managing acute pain. A hybrid strategy relies on joint decision-making between the patient and clinician. The hypothesis for this IRB-approved prospective study was that a hybrid-strategy would be successful in moderating acute pain and reducing leftover opioid doses. Methods and Materials: This study included patients who met the American Society of Anesthesiologists, risk classification I or II, ages 18 to 35 years, with at least 2 mandibular third molars removed. Patients being treated for opioid addiction/abuse were excluded. All enrolled subject patients were consented and treated with a multimodal analgesic protocol consisting of intraoperative IV preventive antibiotics, dexamethasone, ketorolac, ondansetron, local anesthetics including liposomal bupivacaine and postoperative cold therapy, and scheduled ibuprofen. Patients were given 2 prescriptions (Rx), each for 4 doses of Hydrocodone/APAP 5/325, to be taken as needed for pain;1 Rx could be filled on the day of surgery, the second on any subsequent day. Opioid Rx data were retrieved from patient records and North Carolina Controlled Substances Reporting System. Pain scores and opioid-use data for each postsurgery day (PSD) were derived from a 14-day diary recorded by subjects. For the patients in this series, the goal was median pain levels ranked 1 or 2 on a 7-point scale, meaning no pain and minimal pain by postoperative day (POD) 3. Descriptive statistics were used for analyses. Results: Data were analyzed from 96 eligible patients treated consecutively from 2018 to 22, with a 15-month hiatus from COVID-19. Fifty-two patients (54%) did not fill an opioid prescription. Twenty-seven patients (28%) filled 1 opioid prescription and 17 patients (18%) filled 2 of the prescriptions. The patients who filled 1 prescription had 72 leftover doses (67% of possible doses), and the patients who filled 2 prescriptions had 50 leftover doses (74% of possible doses). Median worst pain levels reached 1 to 2 out of 7 on POD 4;median average pain on POD 3. Conclusions: The hybrid strategy reduced the number of opioid doses in circulation without compromising the patient's postoperative pain level. Decreasing the number of leftover opioid doses is an important step toward addressing opioid addiction and overdose.

"Digital mental health and employment - Lessons from the Australian experience","Background and objectives This paper reviews Australia's take-up of digital mental health interventions, including some specific reference to their application in relation to employment. Use of these interventions in Australia was already significant. Under COVID-19 they have exploded. The Australian experience offers useful lessons for European and other countries, and these are summarised. Methods This paper presents a narrative review of key texts, resources, policies and reports, from government and other sources. It also presents data reflecting the take-up of digital mental health services and the employment of people with a mental illness in Australia. Results We present data showing the explosion in uptake of digital mental health services. There is very limited evidence about the impact of these services in improving employment outcomes for people with a mental illness in Australia. The Government has moved to make them a permanent feature of mental health care, in addition to traditional face-to-face care. Conclusion Key lessons emerge from the Australian experience, including the need for target clarity;the importance of blending digital services into broader frameworks of mental health care;the need for quality and safety standards to be developed and applied to digital services;and the need for better evaluation of the outcomes of digital interventions in the workplace. The digital mental health genie is out of the bottle. New capacity for evaluation of the outcomes of digital mental health services is vital to ensure value and quality of such investments.","Rosenberg, Dr Sebastian, Salvador-Carulla, Professor Luis, Lukersmith, Associate Professor Sue, Bagheri, Associate Professor Nasser","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejpsy.2022.08.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The European Journal of Psychiatry;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38774,""
"CREATION OF A VIRTUAL SPECIALIST OUTPATIENT CARDIOLOGY CLINIC FOR CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN AUSTRALIA","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges to health care delivery. There was a need to transition to outpatient telehealth visits that involve distanced real-time interaction between patients and providers using audio and video capabilities without direct physical interaction. We co-designed a virtual cardiology clinic at our centre that services all correctional facilitates across New South Wales, which is Australiaâ€™s most populous state with a land mass bigger than Texas. Objective: We describe the creation of a virtual care specialist outpatient cardiology clinic for correctional services in NSW and assess the service delivery compared to the pre-COVID face-to-face clinics. Methods: Patients were triaged to in-person or virtual clinics via an online referral system. A co-ordinated approach between our centre and Justice Health and Forensic Mental Health, enabled streamlined access to referrals, patient clinical records, investigations and appointments, with future plans of a reciprocal EMR arrangement. The virtual clinic comprised of a clinician, Justice HealthCare Coordinator and an in-facility nurse. Consultations are performed via telehealth with audio and video capabilities, and real-time access to 12-lead electrocardiograms, blood results, medication and observation charts via the EMR portal. We retrospectively reviewed changes in clinic waiting lists, clinic utilisation and patient transfers pre and post implementation of the virtual clinic. Results: 30 clinics were performed with 127 appointments completed over a 6-month period, with 113 virtual and 14 face to face appointments, resulting in 113 patient transfers saved. The waiting list reduced from 66 to 0 with a 33% increase in clinic utilisation during the 6-month period. Conclusion: Implementation of a telehealth cardiology clinic for correctional services in NSW resulted in a reduction in our waiting list, reduced patient transfers and increased clinic utilisation.","Gray, R.; Magdy, J.; Li, J.; Helais, S.; Lougheed, R.; Nicholls, G.; West, S.; Bolton, P.; Ooi, S.

"A cross-country analysis of behavioral changes in response to COVID-19 social distancing policies","As the COVID-19 pandemic spreads globally, many countries now resort to social distancing policies. However, its effectiveness varies from country to country, and the factors responsible for such variations are not yet known. In this study, we conducted a cross-country analysis of behavioral changes that accompany social distancing policies using Google Community Mobility Reports and Appleâ€™s Mobility Trend Reports. The results revealed that (1) the impact of social distancing policies on peopleâ€™s behavior varies completely across countries and time periods, even with the same policy stringency, and (2) not only strong behavioral regulations but also income compensation, information provision, and vaccination policies affect behavior. Moreover, considering that long-term behavioral regulations seriously affect peopleâ€™s physical and mental health and communities, policymakers must well combine direct regulations and indirect policies.","Morita, Hiroyoshi, Takano, Tsuyoshi, Nakamura, Shinichiro, Hayashi, Yoshitsugu","https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-99770-6.00014-4","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Transportation Amid Pandemics;: 225-232, 2023.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38776,""
"Responding to concurrent disasters","As the frequency and severity of emergencies and disasters has increased over the last several decades, more attention has been focused on the challenges public health agencies and other organizations face when responding to multiple disasters at the same time. The COVID-19 pandemic was declared a public health emergency in January 2020. The declaration was most recently renewed by the U.S. Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services on January 14, 2022. During that time, public health emergencies have also been declared in response to earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, winter storms, and the opioid crisis. More broadly, major disaster declarations have been issued by the President of the United States at the request of Governors or Tribal Chief Executives for 100 other events since January 2020, including flooding, wildfires, hurricanes, and tornados. Public health response to these disasters can limit a public health department's ability to continue to provide essential public health services. Public health emergency or disaster response concurrent with the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic has placed unsustainable burdens on public health agencies and their staff, particularly in areas like epidemiology, environmental health, and clinical services that are required for concurrent responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and other disasters or emergencies.","Horney, Jennifer A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-98810-0.00012-0","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The COVID-19 Response;: 85-99, 2023.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38777,""
"Measuring the impact of COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has had major direct impacts on health, including hundreds of millions of cases and nearly five million deaths as of October 2021. Advances in data availability, informatics, visualization, and modeling have made it relatively simple to track the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths across the course of the pandemic. More difficult to measure are the many indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response to it. Canceled medical appointments, missed routine screenings, disruptions to routine immunization schedules, and interruptions to critical preventative health services like childhood lead screening have all occurred as a result of the pandemic and the global public health and healthcare response to it. In addition to the impacts on access to healthcare and public health essential services, the COVID-19 pandemic has had major impacts on employment, childcare, food security, and mental health that have direct and indirect effects on health now and for many years into the future.","Burns, Kaelyn F.; Horney, Jennifer A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-98810-0.00010-7","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: The COVID-19 Response;: 69-84, 2023.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38778,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic and child and adolescent mental healthâ€”what has been learned and lessons for the future","Children and young people have arguably been the group most affected by the societal response to COVID-19. The quality of the evidence base globally on the impact of COVID-19 on child mental health is highly variable.

"Quality of life and professional exhaustion of healthcare workers during the COVID 19 pandemic A narrative review","Introduction. The characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic (speed of transmission, uncertainty in knowledge and management, intensive work demands, severity of illness, death of patients and colleagues) along with the necessary rapid adjustments in healthcare systems affect the mental and physical well-being of health professionals. Purpose. The present paper provides a descriptive literature review of the most recent scientific papers regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the quality of life of health professionals. Twenty three articles published in international scientific journals were retrieved and studied. Results. The studies cover many geographical areas of the planet. Regardless of the venue, the individual characteristics and the specialties of the participants, all of them demonstrate a significant degree of burden on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of health professionals. Health professionals experience anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress, headache, sleep disturbances and worsening of preexisting diseases. The incidence of ""moral fatigue "" and burnout syndrome is unprecedented. Conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic is causing a severe health, social and economic crisis throughout the population, with ""silent "" victims the people working in health care facilities. Healthcare policy designers need to take this fact into account and develop prevention and response strategies. Throughout the world, the relevant studies should be thoroughly analyzed, in order to compile documented programs of mental and physical empowerment for healthcare professionals.","Tsitsani, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Quality+of+life+and+professional+exhaustion+of+healthcare+workers+during+the+COVID+19+pandemic.+A+narrative+review","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Scientific Chronicles; 27(1):62-75, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38782,""

We summarise these findings across three main topics: experiences at the end of life and in early bereavement;coping and informal support during the pandemic;and access to bereavement and mental health services. The synthesis demonstrates the exceptional challenges of pandemic bereavement, including high levels of disruption to end-of-life care, dying and mourning practices as well as to people's social networks and usual coping mechanisms. We identified considerable needs for emotional, therapeutic and informal support among bereaved people, compounded by significant difficulties in receiving and accessing such support.

"Psychological Morbidity After COVID-19 Critical Illness","Survivors of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations often experience severe and debilitating symptoms long after critical illness has resolved. Many patients experience notable psychiatric sequelae such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that may persist for months to years after discharge. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has produced large numbers of critical illness survivors, warranting deeper understanding of psychological morbidity after COVID-19 critical illness. Many patients with critical illness due to COVID-19 experience substantial post-ICU psychological sequelae mediated by specific pathophysiologic, iatrogenic, and situational risk factors. Existing and novel interventions focused on minimizing psychiatric morbidity need to be further investigated in order to improve critical care survivorship after COVID-19 illness. This review proposes a framework to conceptualize three domains of risk factors (pathophysiologic, iatrogenic, and situational) associated with psychological morbidity due to COVID-19 critical illness: (1) direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 virus in the brain; (2) iatrogenic complications of ICU care which may disproportionately affect patients with COVID-19; and (3) social isolation that may worsen psychological morbidity. In addition, we review current interventions to minimize psychological complications after critical illness.","Sankar, Gould, Prescott","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2022.09.035","20221006","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome; Coronavirus-19 Pandemic; Post-Intensive Care Syndrome; SARS-CoV-2 Virus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38789,""
"Psychological and Cognitive Functioning Among Patients Receiving Outpatient Rehabilitation for post-COVID sequelae: An Observational Study","To describe the characteristics of individuals receiving outpatient rehabilitation for post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Further, to examine factors associated with variation in their psychological and cognitive functioning and health-related quality of life. Observational study. Outpatient COVID-19 recovery clinic at a large, tertiary, urban health system in the U.S. COVID-19 survivors with persistent sequelae (n=324). Not applicable. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to examine factors associated with COVID survivors' experience of severe anxiety, severe depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), cognitive impairment, and self-reported health-related quality of life. About 38% of survivors seeking care for their persistent COVID symptoms suffered from severe anxiety, 31.8% from severe depression, 43% experiencing moderate to severe PTSD symptomology, and 17.5% had cognitive impairment. Their health-related quality of life was substantially lower than that of the general population (-26%) and of persons with other chronic conditions. Poor and African American/Black individuals experienced worse psychological and cognitive sequelae following COVID19 infection, even after controlling for age, gender, initial severity of the acute infection, and time since diagnosis. Evidence of consistent disparities in outcomes by the patients' race and socioeconomic status, even among those with access to post-acute COVID rehabilitation care, are concerning and have significant implications for PASC policy and program development.","Abramoff, Dillingham, Brown, Caldera, McLartney, McGinley, Pezzin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apmr.2022.09.013","20221006","COVID-19; Disabled Persons; Healthcare; Outcome Assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38790,""
"COVID-19 vaccination may enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adults","Emerging evidence suggests a detrimental impact of COVID-19 illness on the continued hippocampal neurogenesis in adults. In contrast, the existing literature supports an enhancing effect of COVID-19 vaccination on adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Vaccines against respiratory infections, including influenza, have been shown to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis in adult-age animals. We propose that a similar benefit may happen in COVID-19 vaccinated adults. The vaccine-induced enhancement of the hippocampal neurogenesis in adults thus may protect against age-related cognitive decline and mental disorders. It alsohints at an added mental health benefit of the COVID-19 vaccination programs in adults.","Kumar, Narayan, Prasoon, Jha, Kumar, Kumari, Pandey, Faiq","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2022.09.020","20221006","Acquired immunity; Adult; COVID-19 vaccination; Hippocampus; Neurogenesis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38791,""
"A task-shared, collaborative care psychosocial intervention for improving depressive symptomatology among older adults in a socioeconomically deprived area of Brazil (PROACTIVE): a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomised controlled trial","There is an urgent need to reduce the burden of depression among older adults in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a task-shared, collaborative care psychosocial intervention for improving recovery from depression in older adults in Brazil. PROACTIVE was a pragmatic, two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted in Guarulhos, Brazil. Primary care clinics (clusters) were stratified by educational level and randomly allocated (1:1) to either enhanced usual care alone (control group) or to enhanced usual care plus the psychosocial intervention (intervention group), which involved a 17-week psychosocial programme based on psychoeducation and behavioural activation approaches. Individuals approached for the initial screening assessment were selected randomly from a list of individuals provided by the Health Secretariat of Guarulhos. Face-to-face baseline assessments were conducted among adults aged 60 years or older registered with one of the primary care clinics and identified with clinically significant depressive symptomatology (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score Ã¢â€°Â¥10). Community health workers delivered the programme through home sessions, supported by a dedicated tablet application. Masking of clinic staff and community health workers who delivered the intervention was not feasible; however, research assistants conducting recruitment and follow-up assessments were masked to trial allocation. The primary outcome was recovery from depression (PHQ-9 score &lt;10) at 8-month follow-up. All primary analyses were performed by intention to treat with imputed data. Adaptations to the protocol were made due to the COVID-19 pandemic; recruitment and intervention home sessions were stopped, and follow-up assessments were conducted by telephone. This trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, ISRCTN57805470. We identified 24 primary care clinics in Guarulhos that were willing to participate, of which 20 were randomly allocated to either the control group (ten [50%] clusters) or to the intervention group (ten [50%] clusters). The four remaining eligible clusters were kept as reserves. Between May 23, 2019, and Feb 21, 2020, 8146 individuals were assessed for eligibility, of whom 715 (8Ã‚Â·8%) participants were recruited: 355 (49Ã‚Â·7%) in the control group and 360 (50Ã‚Â·3%) in the intervention group. 284 (80Ã‚Â·0%) participants in the control group and 253 (70Ã‚Â·3%) in the intervention group completed follow-up at 8 months. At 8-month follow-up, 158 (62Ã‚Â·5%) participants in the intervention group showed recovery from depression (PHQ-9 score &lt;10) compared with 125 (44Ã‚Â·0%) in the control group (adjusted odds ratio 2Ã‚Â·16 [95% CI 1Ã‚Â·47-3Ã‚Â·18]; p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). These findings were maintained in the complete case analysis. No adverse events related to the intervention were observed. Although the COVID-19 pandemic altered delivery of the intervention, the low-intensity psychosocial intervention delivered mainly by non-mental health professionals was highly efficacious in improving recovery from depression in older adults in Brazil. Our results support a low-resource intervention that could be useful to reduce the treatment gap for depression among older people in other LMICs.

"Smartphone Usage and Sleep Quality in Korean Middle School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study evaluated the quality of sleep and smartphone addiction in Korean adolescents during the coronavirus disease 19 pandemic and analyzed their effects on perceived quality of life. An online survey system provided by the Gwangmyeong City Health Center located in Gyeonggi-do, Korea, was completed by 1,678 local middle school students from April 1 to June 30, 2021. We measured quality of life using the KIDSCREEN-27 health-related quality of life questionnaire, quality of sleep using the Korean version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and smartphone addiction using the Smartphone Addiction Self-Diagnosis Scale. Bed times, wake times, and total sleep hours were also recorded. Sleep quality and quantity were directly associated with smartphone addiction. The results indicated that lower quality of life was associated with lower sleep quality, delayed onset of sleep, shorter total sleep time, and higher smartphone addiction. Female students reported lower quality of life, lower sleep quality, delayed sleep phases, shorter total sleep hours, and higher smartphone addiction scores than did male students. Our results suggest that adolescents' quality of life is threatened by poor sleep, which in turn could be due to unhealthy smartphone usage. Girls were more heavily affected by this trend than were boys. Preparations to intervene for further mental health issues that might follow are necessary.","Chi, Ko, Lee, Yi, Lee","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2022.0032","20221006","COVID-19; Quality of life; Sleep quality; Smartphone addiction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38793,""
"Intolerance of Uncertainty Mediates the Influence of Viral Anxiety on Social Distancing Phobia Among the General Korean Population During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","We aimed to examined the reliability and validity of Korean version of Social Distancing Phobia scale, and whether intolerance of uncertainty mediates the association of the general population's social distancing phobia with viral anxiety and depression. Through this anonymous online survey, we collected responses from 400 individuals in the general Korean population. Participants' demographic information and rating scales scores, including the Social Distancing Phobia scale, Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-6 items, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Intolerance of Uncertainty-12 items. Confirmatory factor analysis showed a good model fit, and the Korean version of Social Distancing Phobia scale showed good internal consistency. Social distancing phobia was significantly correlated with age (r=0.213, p&lt;0.001), viral anxiety (r=0.390, p&lt;0.001), depression (r=0.244, p&lt;0.001), and intolerance of uncertainty (r=0.323, p&lt;0.001). A linear regression analysis showed that age (ÃŽÂ²=0.235, p&lt;0.001), viral anxiety (ÃŽÂ²=0.281, p&lt;0.001), depression (ÃŽÂ²=0.121, p=0.009), and intolerance of uncertainty (ÃŽÂ²=0.200, p&lt;0.001; adjusted R2=0.246, F=33.6, p&lt;0.001) predicted social distancing phobia. Mediation analysis revealed that viral anxiety directly influenced social distancing phobia (z=6.48, p&lt;0.001), and intolerance of uncertainty partially mediated this association (z=2.92, p=0.003). Social distancing phobia may cause psychological stress but may also increase adherence to physical distancing measures and prevent the spread of viruses.","Cho, Ahmed, Lee, Cho, Chung, GÃƒÂ¼nlÃƒÂ¼","https://doi.org/10.30773/pi.2022.0124","20221006","Anxiety; COVID-19; Physical distancing; Social distancing; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38794,""
"Prospective associations between pandemic-related adversity, harsh parenting, and the development of prosociality across middle to late childhood","Parenting behaviors and children's prosociality (i.e., voluntary behaviors intended to benefit others) are linked across development. Contextual risk and environmental stressors may undermine parenting behaviors known to promote children's prosocial behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a unique context in which to examine how stress and contextual risk disrupt parenting practices and the development of children's prosociality over time. To explore the associations between pandemic-related adversity, parenting practices, and child prosocial behavior, we used survey data from 303 families (child <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 6.43; 51.4% female, 48.6% male; 65.7% White) who participated in a three-wave longitudinal study during the first year of the pandemic. Families were recruited from two northeastern cities in the United States. Growth mixture modeling identified two groups of parents who varied in their experience of pandemic-related adversity. The high-adversity group reported significantly more symptoms of depression and anxiety, parental burnout, and pandemic-related worries than the low-adversity group. At baseline, parents in the high-adversity group reported harsher parenting and perceived less prosocial behavior in their children. Across the full sample, there were no significant changes in harsh parenting and parental perceptions of child's prosociality across the first year of the pandemic. However, within the high-adversity group, increases in harsh parenting were related to reductions in children's prosociality over time. Results are interpreted in the context of family systems theory and contribute to our understanding of the links between parenting and children's prosociality and patterns of risk and resilience in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The association of age with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain: the role of loneliness and pre-pandemic mental disorder","Older adults may be at lower risk of common mental disorders than younger adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous researchers have shown differences by age in psychosocial well-being during the pandemic and have highlighted the moderating effect of pre-pandemic mental disorders on that association. In this line, we examined the association of age with self-reported symptoms of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, as well as potential roles of loneliness symptoms and pre-pandemic mental disorders on the association between age and mental disorder symptoms. Cross-sectional data of 2,000 Spanish adults interviewed by phone during the COVID-19 pandemic (February-March, 2021) were analyzed. Depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress were measured with the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, the 7-item GAD, and the 4-item checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), respectively. Loneliness was measured with the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale. Several regression models were constructed to assess factors related to loneliness and mental disorders. According to cut-off points used, 12.4% of participants revealed depression, 11.9% anxiety, and 11.6% posttraumatic stress. Age was negatively related with mental disorder symptoms and loneliness. Loneliness was associated with higher levels of mental disorder symptoms. This association was stronger in younger adults without pre-pandemic mental disorders and in older adults without them. The association between age and loneliness was stronger in those with pre-pandemic mental disorders. Loneliness mediated the association of age with mental disorder symptoms. Interventions focused on loneliness could alleviate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health.","Gabarrell-Pascuet, Koyanagi, FÃƒÂ©lez-Nobrega, CristÃƒÂ³bal-NarvÃƒÂ¡ez, Mortier, Vilagut, Olaya, Alonso, Haro, DomÃƒÂ¨nech-Abella","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000001146","20221006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38796,""
"The effect of antidepressants on the severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Clinical Depression and the subsequent low immunity is a comorbidity that can act as a risk factor for the severity of COVID-19 cases. Antidepressants such as Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are associated with immune-modulatory effects, which dismiss inflammatory responses and reduce lung tissue damage. The current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of antidepressant drugs on the prognosis and severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients. A systematic search was carried out in PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, and Scopus up to June 14, 2022. The following keywords were used: ""COVID-19"", ""SARS-CoV-2"", ""2019-nCoV"", ""SSRI"", ""SNRI"", ""TCA"", ""MAOI"", and ""Antidepressant"". A fixed or random-effect model assessed the pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We considered P &lt; 0.05 as statistically significant for publication bias. Data were analyzed by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software, Version 2.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ). Fourteen studies were included in our systematic review. Five of them were experimental with 2350, and nine of them were observational with 290,950 participants. Eight out of fourteen articles revealed the effect of antidepressants on reducing the severity of COVID-19. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors drugs, including Fluvoxamine, Escitalopram, Fluoxetine, and Paroxetine, and among the Serotonin-norepinephrine inhibitors medications Venlafaxine, are reasonably associated with reduced risk of intubation or death. Five studies showed no significant effect, and only one high risk of bias article showed the negative effect of antidepressants on the prognosis of Covid-19. The meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that fluvoxamine could significantly decrease the severity outcomes of COVID-19 (RR: 0.763; 95% CI: 0.602-0.966, I2: 0.0). Most evidence supports that the use of antidepressant medications, mainly Fluvoxamine, may decrease the severity and improve the outcome in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2. Some studies showed contradictory findings regarding the effects of antidepressants on the severity of COVID-19. Further clinical trials should be conducted to clarify the effects of antidepressants on the severity of COVID-19.","Nakhaee, Zangiabadian, Bayati, Rahmanian, Ghaffari Jolfayi, Rakhshanderou","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0267423","20221006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38797,""
"Lessons Learned From the Public Health Workforce's Experiences With the COVID-19 Response","Limited research is available on the COVID-19 response experiences of local, state, and federal public health workers in the United States. Although the response to COVID-19 is still presenting challenges to the public health workforce, public health systems must also begin to consider lessons learned that can be applied to future disasters. During July and August 2021, a random sample of participants from a cross-sectional study of the public health workforce was invited to participate in interviews to obtain information on the current state of public health operations, the ongoing response to the COVID-19 crisis, and takeaways for improving future preparedness and response planning. Interviews were transcribed and inductively coded to identify themes. Twenty-four initial interview invitations were sent, and random substitutions were made until thematic saturation was reached when 17 interviews were completed. Four thematic categories were identified, including challenges related to (1) ongoing lack of political support or policy guidance; (2) fluctuations in, and uncertainty about, future funding and associated requirements; (3) job expectations, including remote work and data-sharing capabilities; and (4) the mental health toll of sustained response and related burnout. As the public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic continues in its third year, it is crucial to identify lessons learned that can inform future investment in order to sustain a public health workforce and a public health preparedness and response system that is resilient to future disasters.","Scales, Patrick, Stone, Kintziger, Jagger, Horney","https://doi.org/10.1089/hs.2022.0091","20221006","COVID-19; Epidemic management/response; Psychological impacts; Public health preparedness/response; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38798,""
"In-person training on COVID-19 case management and infection prevention and control: Evaluation of healthcare professionals in Bangladesh","As COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic, the major focus of healthcare organizations shifted towards preparing healthcare systems to handle the inevitable COVID-19 burden at different phases and levels. A series of in-person training programs were operated in collaboration with government and partner organizations for the healthcare workers (HCW) of Bangladesh. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of HCWs regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, their case management, infection prevention and control to fight against the ongoing pandemic. As a part of the National Preparedness and Response Plan for COVID-19 in Bangladesh, the training program was conducted at four district-level hospitals and one specialized hospital in Bangladesh from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021. A total of 755 HCWs participated in the training sessions. Among them, 357 (47%) were enrolled for the evaluation upon completion of the data, collected from one district hospital (Feni) and one specialized hospital (National Institute of Mental Health). The mean percentage of pre-test and post-test scores of all the participants were found to be 57% (95% CI 8.34-8.91; p 0.01) and 65% (95% CI 9.56-10.15; p &lt;0.001) respectively. The difference of score (mean) between the groups was significant (p&lt;0.001). After categorizing participants' knowledge levels as poor, average and fair, doctors' group has shown to have significant enhancement from level of average to fair compared to that of the nurses. Factors associated with knowledge augmentation of doctors were working in primary health care centers (aOR: 4.22; 95% CI: 1.80, 9.88), job experience less than 5 years (aOR: 4.10; 95% CI: 1.01, 16.63) and experience in caring of family member with COVID-19 morbidity (aOR: 2.06; 95% CI: 1.03, 4.10), after adjusting for relevant covariates such as age, sex and prior COVID-19 illness. Considering the series of waves of COVID-19 pandemic with newer variants, the present paper underscores the importance of implementing the structured in-person training program on case management, infection prevention and control for the HCWs that may help for successful readiness prior to future pandemics that may further help to minimize the pandemic related fatal consequences.","Shahrin, Parvin, Sarmin, Abbassi, Ackhter, Alam, Mamun, Rahman, Shaima, Shikha, Jeorge, Nahar, Sharifuzzaman, Saha, Rahman, Shahid, Faruque, Ahmed, Chisti","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273809","20221006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38799,""
"Emerging technologies of 3D printing and mHealth in COVID-19 immunity and regenerative dentistry","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of developing point-of-care (POC) antibody tests for monitoring the COVID-19 immune response upon viral infection or following vaccination, which requires three key aspects to achieve optimal monitoring, including 3D printed POC device, mobile health, and non-invasive sampling. As a critical tissue engineering concept, additive manufacturing (3D printing) enables accurate control over the dimensional and architectural features of the devices. Mobile health (mHealth) refers to use of portable digital devices, such as smartphones, tablet computers, and fitness and medical wearables, to support health, which facilitates contact tracing, and telehealth consultations during the pandemic. Compared to invasive biosample - blood, saliva is of great importance in the spread and surveillance of COVID-19 as a non-invasive diagnostic method for virus detection and immune status monitoring. However, investigations into 3D printed POC antibody tests and mHealth using non-invasive saliva is relatively limited. and further exploration of 3D-printed antibody POC tests and mHealth applications to monitor antibody production either for disease onset or immune response following vaccination is warranted. This review briefly describes the SARS-CoV-2 virus and immune response after infection and vaccination, then discusses current widely used binding antibody tests using blood samples and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays on 2D microplates before focusing upon emerging POC technological platforms, such as field-effect transistor biosensors, lateral flow assay, microfluidics, and additive manufacturing for fabricating immunoassays, and the possibility of their combination with mHealth. This review proposes that non-invasive biofluid sampling combined with 3D POC antibody tests and mHealth technologies is a promising and novel approach for POC detection and surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 immune response. Furthermore, as key concepts in Dentistry, the application of 3D printing and mHealth was also included to facilitate the appreciation of cutting-edge techniques in regenerative dentistry. This review highlights the potential of 3D printing and mHealth in both COVID-19 immunity monitoring and regenerative dentistry.","Liu, Staples, GÃƒÂ³mez Cerezo, Ivanovski, Han","https://doi.org/10.1089/ten.TEC.2022.0160","20221006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38800,""

A web-based anonymous survey has been conducted. Of the 324 responders (23-69 years; 78.09% females), 41.05% was nurse, 31.17% medical doctor, 7.72% employee with administrative function, 3.09% psychologist, 1.54% biologist, 13.58% grouped in the ""other"" category. 60.49% worked in a no-covid-19 ward, 20.37% in the covid-19 ward, 13.58% in outpatient clinics, and 5.56% outside the hospital. 45.06% have been exposed to covid-19 and 7.72% tested positive for covid-19. 66.67% were satisfied with the safety measures taken by the hospital. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, as measured by IES-R, and peritraumatic distress, measured by CPDI, were frequently reported (41.05% and 43.21%, respectively). PTSD resulted independently associated with peritraumatic distress (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR 49.83), perception of being avoided by family and/or friends due to work performed (AOR= 4.05), low hope for the future (AOR= 2.25) and female gender (AOR= 2.90). Age and profession were considered confounding variables. These results showed that even in times of reduced restrictions, the prevalence of peritraumatic distress and PTSD is high, regardless of work and professional specialization, length of service, more or less direct contact with covid-19 patients. Since the biological damage resulting from a PTSD is known, it is important to activate screening programs followed by specific interventions to reduce long-term risks to mental health.","Costantini, Mazzotti, Cappitella, De Biase, Stella, Anibaldi","https://doi.org/10.1708/3893.38744","20221006","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38801,""
"Participation Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Analysis","Participation in life situations is a critical aspect of health recognized by the World Health Organization. Guidelines to prevent spreading of COVID-19 place older adults at risk for worsening participation. The purpose of this study was to identify the factors associated with participation during the COVID-19 pandemic among community-dwelling older adults living in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Participants were recruited from identified census dissemination areas in Hamilton. Participants completed surveys either by phone or online during the months of May to August 2020. Measures were organized into factors related to body functions and structures, activities, participation, as well as personal and environmental contextual factors using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) framework. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with participation as measured by the Late-Life Disability Instrument's (LLDI) frequency and limitations scales. A total of 272 older adults completed the survey (78 y [SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.3 y]; 70% female). Use of a walking aid, driving status, perceived mental health status, nutrition risk, and physical function explained 48.2% of the variance observed in the LLDI-frequency scale scores. Use of a walking aid, driving status, perceived mental health status, receiving health assistance, and physical function explained 38.5% of the variance observed in the LLDI-limitation scale scores. Results highlighted factors across multiple ICF domains that are associated with participation restriction among a sample of community-dwelling older adults during the pandemic. Participation during the pandemic was greatest in those that were able to walk without needing to use a walking aid, being a licensed and current driver, perceiving good to excellent mental health, and having greater physical function. Our findings contribute to the literature on older adult participation during lockdowns, restrictions, pandemics, and/or other similar circumstances.","Nguyen, Macedo, Vrkljan, Kirkwood, Ma, Vesnaver, Keller, Astephen-Wilson, Beauchamp","https://doi.org/10.1093/ptj/pzac132","20221006","COVID-19; Community-Dwelling; Driving; Mental Health Participation in Life Situations; Older Adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38802,""
"Prevalence and factors of posttraumatic growth among Hubei residents during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health has been widely concerned, but the research on positive psychological factors is insufficient, this study aims to investigate the prevalence and factors of posttraumatic growth (PTG) among residents in the worst-hit areas of China (Hubei Province). We were conducted in three disaster areas with different severity in Hubei Province three months after the outbreak, and the data were from 575 respondents. Instruments included the simplified Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (C-PTGI) and the public health emergency psychological questionnaire. Nonparametric tests, Spearman correlation analyses, and multiple linear regression equations were used to analyze the data. The results showed that three months after the outbreak of COVID-19, the PTG of Hubei residents was at a low level, and their sense of fear was the most prominent, with a positive detection rate of 82.09%. According to the results of this study, high PTG levels were associated with high levels of fear, married and healthcare providers, while low levels of PTG were associated with serious chronic diseases, males, good economic status, and poor prevention and control measures. Government departments should strengthen social support for residents, carry out necessary stress management training to help them correctly deal with negative emotions and promote their personal growth.","Liu, Zeng, Wang, Feng, Jin, Xie, Tang, Qiu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1080/13548506.2022.2132409","20221006","COVID-19; cross-sectional; posttraumatic growth; residents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38803,""
"Impact of Yoga Practice on Level of Stress During COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major cause of stress and anxiety worldwide. It has generated stress among people from all sections of society, especially to workers who have been assigned to cater to healthcare service or those constrained to secure daily essential items. Yoga practice is actively sought to achieve reduced anxiety and stress so that improved sleep may positively impact immunity. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether those who practice Yoga during the COVID-19 pandemic have lower levels of stress, anxiety, and depression than those who do not. The sample consists of 51 females who have been attending Yoga sessions for many years and who continued this practice during the COVID-19 pandemic twice a week. The control group consisted of 50 non-Yoga respondents. The survey was conducted during April 2021. The Revised Event Impact Scale (IES-R) (4) and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) (Derogatis, 1993) were used to assess stress. Student T-test was used to check the statistical significance of differences. In our research yoga practitioners show a statistically significantly lower average severity of stress symptoms compared to those who do not practice yoga on 5 of the 6 stress indicators shown. The only statistically significant difference was not obtained on the measure of total number of symptoms (PST). The results suggest that yoga practice during COVID-19 pandemic is associated with lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression.","Sinanovic, Vidacek, Muftic","https://doi.org/10.5455/msm.2022.34.118-120","20221006","Anxiety; COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Stress; Yoga practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38804,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthy Lifestyles in Rural Families","The purpose of the current study is to understand how the early portion of COVID-19 pandemic impacted the health behaviors of rural families participating in a healthy lifestyles intervention. Caregivers of rural children participating in a healthy lifestyles intervention were invited to participate in a structured interview regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their family and family health behaviors. Interviews were transcribed and the research team conducted a rigorous inductive thematic analysis. Structured qualitative interviews with caregivers (n=30) resulted in 5 saturated themes: (a) caregivers reported new or exacerbated mental health concerns and stress among family members, largely due to social isolation and external stressors, (b) caregivers reported feeling out of control of positive health behaviors for themselves and their children, (c) families reported variability in how they handled reductions in schedule demands, ranging from filling time with positive activities to negative behaviors such as snacking, (d) families continuously re-adjusted their approach to parenting, routines, and health behaviors due to internal and external factors, (e) families ate foods that were accessible and convenient, which impacted the health of the family diet. Despite being asked primarily about lifestyle behavior changes, families reported concerns around mental health. Implications are that professionals working with rural children and families, even those without mental health training, may be called upon to help address these concerns especially in these underserved, rural families.","England, Forseth, Bangash, Bhagat, Murray, Bakula, Davis","https://doi.org/10.51250/jheal.v2i1.30","20221006","SARS-CoV2; health behaviors; mental health; physical activity; qualitative","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38805,""
"Routine E-Screening for Perinatal Mental Health During the COVID-19 Emergency: Beyond the Instrument Cut-Off Points","The COVID-19 pandemic represents a significant risk factor for mental distress in perinatal women. Assessment for mental health issues should therefore be an integral part of safeguarding health at every stage of pregnancy and postpartum. Considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the planning of healthcare services locally, it is important to employ information-gathering techniques such as seeking feedback from both patients and staff. E-screening conforms to stay-at-home COVID restrictions and can improve the efficiency of mental healthcare. The symptomatologic levels indicated by the cut-off points, as well as the real time concerns expressed by perinatal women through open questions, are valuable on many levels. Future studies are needed not only on the sensitivity of the e-screening routines in the context of daily clinical practice, but also on the deeper meaning of the personal concerns reported in e-screening open questions in both positive and negative screening environments.","Grussu, Quatraro, Alderdice, Jorizzo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-022-03468-5","20221005","Covid19; E-screening; Perinatal mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38806,""
"The relationship of adverse childhood experiences, hair cortisol, C-reactive protein, and polygenic susceptibility with older adults' psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to poorer mental health outcomes, and growing evidence implicates biological and genetic pathways from early adversity to psychopathology. However, little is known about the relationship of ACEs and their underlying biological and genetic mechanisms with older people's mental health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. We tested the associations of ACEs, hair cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and polygenic scores (PGS) with depression, anxiety, and loneliness among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic, accounting for the potential interplay of ACEs with biological and genetic risk markers. Data were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, a prospective cohort study of older adults living in England. Retrospective information on ACEs were collected in 2006/7, while CRP and hair cortisol were measured at wave 6 (2012/13). Psychological distress was assessed before the pandemic (2018-19) and at two COVID-19 assessments in 2020 (June-July and November-December). Associations were tested on 2050 participants using linear/logistic regression models adjusted for pre-pandemic outcome measures and mixed-effect models to assess changes before and during the pandemic. The results showed that ACEs were associated with higher levels of depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.55[95%CI:1.81,3.59]) anxiety (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.84[95%CI:1.13,3.01]), and loneliness (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.28[95%CI:0.14,0.42]) during the pandemic. Hair cortisol was related to an increased risk of depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.15[95%CI:1.04,1.26]), and CRP was associated with greater loneliness scores (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.16[95%CI:0.03,0.30]). The relationship between cortisol and psychological distress was larger among participants with ACEs (e.g., OR<sub>depression</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.07[95%CI:1.00,1.14]). Further, individuals with high CRP experienced greater increases in feelings of loneliness from before to during the pandemic, compared to those with lower CRP levels (interaction effect=0.23; 95%CI:0.1-0.37). Individuals with 2+ ACEs experienced greater increases in depressive symptoms compared to those with none (interaction effect=2.09; 95%CI:1.1-3.98). Higher levels of hair cortisol were also related to worse changes in depressive symptoms across timepoints (interaction effect=1.84;95%CI:1.41-2.41). These results highlight the lasting impact of biosocial vulnerabilities on older adults' mental health responses to new environmental stressors. They also implicate biological mechanisms in the pathophysiology of later-life psychological distress.","Taylor, Steptoe, Iob","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01805-2","20221005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38807,""
"The impact of the initial COVID-19 outbreak on young adults' mental health: a longitudinal study of risk and resilience factors","Few studies assessing the effects of COVID-19 on mental health include prospective markers of risk and resilience necessary to understand and mitigate the combined impacts of the pandemic, lockdowns, and other societal responses. This population-based study of young adults includes individuals from the Neuroscience in Psychiatry Network (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2403) recruited from English primary care services and schools in 2012-2013 when aged 14-24. Participants were followed up three times thereafter, most recently during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 outbreak when they were aged between 19 and 34. Repeated measures of psychological distress (K6) and mental wellbeing (SWEMWBS) were supplemented at the latest assessment by clinical measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). A total of 1000 participants, 42% of the original cohort, returned to take part in the COVID-19 follow-up; 737 completed all four assessments [mean age (SD), 25.6 (3.2) years; 65.4% female; 79.1% White]. Our findings show that the pandemic led to pronounced deviations from existing mental health-related trajectories compared to expected levels over approximately seven years. About three-in-ten young adults reported clinically significant depression (28.8%) or anxiety (27.6%) under current NHS guidelines; two-in-ten met clinical cut-offs for both. About 9% reported levels of psychological distress likely to be associated with serious functional impairments that substantially interfere with major life activities; an increase by 3% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Deviations from personal trajectories were not necessarily restricted to conventional risk factors; however, individuals with pre-existing health conditions suffered disproportionately during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Resilience factors known to support mental health, particularly in response to adverse events, were at best mildly protective of individual psychological responses to the pandemic. Our findings underline the importance of monitoring the long-term effects of the ongoing pandemic on young adults' mental health, an age group at particular risk for the emergence of psychopathologies. Our findings further suggest that maintaining access to mental health care services during future waves, or potential new pandemics, is particularly crucial for those with pre-existing health conditions. Even though resilience factors known to support mental health were only mildly protective during the initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains to be seen whether these factors facilitate mental health in the long term.","Wiedemann, Stochl, Neufeld, Fritz, Bhatti, Hook, Goodyer, Dolan, Bullmore, Chamberlain, Fonagy, Perez, Jones, Bullmore, Dolan, Goodyer, Fonagy, Jones, Moutoussis, Hauser, Neufeld, Romero-Garcia, Clair, VÃƒÂ©rtes, Whitaker, Inkster, Prabhu, Ooi, Toseeb, Widmer, Bhatti, Villis, Alrumaithi, Birt, Bowler, Cleridou, Dadabhoy, Davies, Firkins, Granville, Harding, Hopkins, Isaacs, King, Kokorikou, Maurice, McIntosh, Memarzia, Mills, O'Donnell, Pantaleone, Scott, Kiddle, Polek, Fearon, Suckling, van Harmelen, Kievit, Chamberlain, Bethlehem","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-21053-2","20221005","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38808,""
"Experiences of parents of children with rare neurogenetic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic: an interpretative phenomenological analysis","Background The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted parental and child mental health and wellbeing in the UK. This study aimed to explore the experiences of parents of children with rare neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions with a known or suspected genetic cause (neurogenetic) across the first year of the pandemic in the UK. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 parents of children with rare neurogenetic conditions. Parents were recruited via opportunity sampling from the CoIN Study, a longitudinal quantitative study exploring the impact of the pandemic on the mental health and wellbeing of families with rare neurogenetic conditions. Interviews were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results Four main themes were identified: (1) â€œA varied impact on child wellbeing: from detrimental to â€˜no big dramaâ€™â€; (2) â€œParental mental health and wellbeing: impact, changes and copingâ€; (3) â€œThe world had shut its doors and that was thatâ€™: care and social services during the pandemicâ€; and (4) â€œTime and luck: abstract concepts central to parents understanding of their pandemic experienceâ€. The majority of parents described experiencing an exacerbation of pre-pandemic challenges due to increased uncertainty and a lack of support, with a minority reporting minimal or positive effects of the pandemic on family wellbeing. Conclusions These findings offer a unique insight into the experiences parents of children with rare neurogenetic conditions across the first year of the pandemic in the UK. They highlight that the experiences of parents are not pandemic-specific, and will continue to be highly relevant in a non-pandemic context. Future support should to be tailored to the needs of families identified in this study and implemented across diverse future scenarios to promote coping and positive wellbeing.","Jessica Martin et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01A8-A99-F45","20221007","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; covid-19; neurogenetic conditons; wellbeing; mental health; interpretative phenomenological analysis","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-07","",38809,""
