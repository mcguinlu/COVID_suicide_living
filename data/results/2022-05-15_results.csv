"Acceptability of a behavioural intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 restrictions in older people with long-term conditions: a qualitative study","Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need to address loneliness and social isolation (and associated incidence of depression) amongst older adults. Between June and October 2020, the Behavioural Activation in Social IsoLation (BASIL) pilot study investigated the acceptability and feasibility of a remotely delivered brief psychological intervention (Behavioural Activation, BA) to prevent and reduce loneliness and depression in older people with long term conditions (LTCs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design An embedded qualitative study was conducted with semi-structured interviews to generate data that was first analysed inductively using thematic analysis and then deductively using the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). Setting National Health Service and third sector organisations in England. Participants Sixteen older adults and 9 Support Workers (BSWs) participating in the BASIL pilot trial. Results Older adults and BSWs described a positive affective attitude towards the intervention linked to altruism, however the activity planning aspect of the intervention was limited due to COVID-19 restrictions. The intervention was understood by older adults & BSWs, although less understanding in older adults without low mood. A manageable burden was involved with delivering and participating in the intervention. For ethicality, older adults valued social contact and making changes, BSWs valued being able to observe those changes. Opportunity cost was low for BSWs & older adults. BA was perceived to be useful in the pandemic and likely to achieve its aims, (Perceived Effectiveness) especially if tailored to people with both low mood and LTCs. Self-efficacy developed over time and with experience for both BSWs and older adults. Conclusions Overall, the BASIL pilot study processes and BA intervention were found to be acceptable. Use of the TFA provided valuable insights into how the intervention was experienced and how the acceptability of study processes and the BA intervention could be enhanced ahead of the larger definitive trial (BASIL+).","Leanne Shearsmith; Peter Coventry; Claire Sloan; Andrew Henry; Lauren Burke; Eloise Ryde; Elizabeth Newbronner; Della Bailey; Samantha Gascoyne; Rebecca Woodhouse; Dean McMillan; David Ekers; Simon Gilbody; Carolyn A.

"Frailty is associated with poor mental health 1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯year after hospitalisation with COVID-19","Frailty is associated with long-term physical deterioration after COVID-19. Mental health recovery has been less well investigated. Early studies have shown minimal effect from the virus, although studies have not focused on whether people living with frailty may have different psychiatric outcomes. We aimed to examine the effect of living with frailty on mental health outcomes one year after hospital with COVID-19. We undertook a multicentre cross-sectional study of people admitted with COVID-19. We assessed quality of life (ICECAP-O and MRC), psychiatric symptoms including: generalised anxiety (GAD-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and trauma (Trauma Screening Questionnaire). Frailty was measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). We used a multivariable mixed-effects logistic and linear regression to examine the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and adjusted mean difference (aMD). From eight hospitals 224 participants consented. Median follow-up time from admission 358Ã¢â‚¬Â¯days (IQR 153-418), mean age 63.8 (SDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯13.7), 34.8% female (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯78), and 43.7% living with frailty (nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯98 CFS 4-8). People living with frailty were significantly more likely to have symptoms of anxiety aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯5.72 (95% CI 1.71-19.13), depression aORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯2.52 (95% CI 1.59-14.91), post-traumatic stress disorder aMDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.16 (95% CI 0.47, 1.85), and worse quality of life aMDÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.06 (95% CI 0.76-1.36). Patient-rated symptoms were captured rather than formal mental health diagnoses. CFS has not been validated in under 65-year-olds. Living with frailty is associated with significant psychiatric morbidity and reduced wellbeing one year after COVID-19 hospital admission. We recommend clinical follow-up after COVID-19 for people living with frailty should include a psychiatric assessment.","Braude, McCarthy, Strawbridge, Short, Verduri, Vilches-Moraga, Hewitt, Carter","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.035","20220514","COVID-19; Clinical Frailty Scale; Depression; Frailty; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31429,""
"Concern about COVID-19 among the Spanish population: Validation of a scale and associated symptoms","The health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a considerable increase in the psychopathology of COVID-19 patients and among the general population. This study aims to conduct the psychometric analysis of the scale of concern about COVID-19 in the Spanish population and to estimate the level of concern and dysfunctional anxiety present one year after the lockdown measures in Spain aimed at resisting the spread of the viral disease among the population. The factorial structure of the instrument, its reliability for the general population and for COVID patients, and its construct validity have been analyzed, and measurements of dysfunctional concern have been obtained from a sample of 502 adults. The scale of concern about COVID-19 showed optimal results of reliability and validity for the Spanish population, confirming that it is an ideal instrument for estimating the concern regarding coronavirus contagion. This study used a cross-sectional design and thus, could not compare the changes in the incidence of anxiety symptoms before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Furthermore, the use of mental health services prior to the COVID-19 restrictions was not assessed in this study, and therefore, no comparisons between the two time points could be made. After a year of the confinement measures that was instilled to avoid further spread of the disease, the Spanish population presented levels of concern and anxiety that may require clinical attention, with a significant percentage of participants meeting the requirements to be diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorders.","Penado, Serrano-IbÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, CorrÃƒÂ¡s VÃƒÂ¡zquez, Del-Prado Morales, LÃƒÂ³pez-Flores","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.018","20220514","Anxiety; COVID-19; Concern; Contagion; Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31430,""
"Psychological distress associated with the second COVID-19 wave: Prospective evidence from the UK Household Longitudinal Study","In late 2020 a second wave of COVID-19 infections occurred in many countries and resulted in a national lockdown in the UK including stay at home orders and school closures. This study aimed to compare the prevalence of psychological distress before and during the second COVID-19 wave in the UK. This study drew on data from 10,657 participants from the nationally representative probability-based UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). The 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) assessment measure was used to detect the proportion of UK adults experiencing clinically significant psychological distress. Changes in distress levels associated with the second pandemic wave were examined between September 2020 and January 2021 using logistic regression and linear fixed-effects regression models. Longitudinal analyses showed that the prevalence of clinically significant distress rose by 5.8% (95% CI: 4.4-7.2) from 21.3% in September 2020 to 27.1% in January 2021, compared with a 2019 pre-pandemic estimate of 21% in this cohort. Fixed effects analyses confirmed that the second COVID-19 wave was associated with a significant within-person increase in distress (dÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.15, pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯.001). Increases were particularly pronounced among those with school-age children in the home. A non-specific measure of mental health symptoms was utilized and it was not possible to separate the potential impact of the pandemic from other changes occurring in tandem within the study period. Clinically significant distress rose during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and reached levels similar to those observed in the immediate aftermath of the first pandemic wave.","Daly, Robinson","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.025","20220514","COVID-19; Longitudinal research; Mental health; Nationally representative study; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31431,""
"The Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Intensivists' Well-Being: A Qualitative Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has strained healthcare systems and resulted in widespread critical care staffing shortages, negatively impacting quality of care delivered. How have hospitals' emergency responses to the pandemic influenced the well-being of frontline intensivists, and are there any potential strategies to improve their well-being and help preserve the critical care workforce? We performed semi-structured interviews of intensivists at clusters of tertiary and community hospitals located in six regions across the U.S. between August-November 2020, using the ""Four S framework"" of acute surge planning (i.e., Space, Staff, Stuff, and System) to organize the interview guide. We then employed inductive thematic analysis to identify themes describing the influence of hospitals' emergency responses on intensivists' well-being. 33 intensivists from 7 tertiary and 6 community hospitals participated. Intensivists reported experiencing substantial moral distress, particularly due to restricted visitor policies and their perceived negative impacts on patients, families, and staff. Intensivists also frequently reported burnout symptoms due to their experiences with patient death, exhaustion over the pandemic's duration, and perceived lack of support from colleagues and hospitals. We identified several potentially modifiable factors perceived to improve morale, including the proactive provision of mental health resources, establishment of formal back-up schedules for physicians, and clear actions demonstrating that clinicians are valued by their institutions. Restrictive visitation policies contributed to moral distress as reported by intensivists, highlighting the need to reconsider the risks and benefits of these policies. We also identified several interventions as perceived by intensivists that may help mitigate moral distress and improve burnout as part of efforts to preserve the critical care workforce.","Vranas, Golden, Nugent, Valley, Schutz, Duggal, Seitz, Chang, Slatore, Sullivan, Hough, Mathews","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chest.2022.05.003","20220514","Burnout Syndrome; COVID-19 Pandemic; Clinician Well-Being; Intensive Care Unit; Moral Distress; Qualitative Methods; Visitor Policies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31432,""
"Impact of COVID- 19 pandemic on antidepressants consumptions by wastewater analysis in Turkey","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major challenge worldwide, forcing countries to take restrictive measures beyond conventional methods in their fight against the spread of the disease. Followingly, many studies have been conducted on the effects of these measures on mental health. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was used in this study to monitor and estimate changes in antidepressant use under normal conditions (2019) and COVID-19 pandemic conditions (2020). Likewise, this study utilized wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) to monitor and assess changing trends from the pre-pandemic period (2019) to COVID-19 pandemic conditions in antidepressant use (2020). Wastewater samples were collected from 11 cities in Turkey throughout six sampling periods covering the pre-pandemic and during-pandemic periods (June 2019-December 2020). Then, samples were analyzed via LC-MS/MS method. As a result, we observed that venlafaxine was the drug with the highest concentration (meanÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯SD: 103.6Ã¢â‚¬Â¯Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬Â¯112.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯mg/1000p/day). Moreover, city number 6 presented the highest venlafaxine use and the most dramatic increase during the pandemic period. Finally, this study revealed the potential of WBE to estimate the changing trends in mental health during the ongoing pandemic.","Guzel, Atasoy, GÃƒÂ¶ren, Daglioglu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.155916","20220514","Antidepressants; COVID-19; Drug consumption rate changes; Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31433,""
"Health outcomes in people 2 years after surviving hospitalisation with COVID-19: a longitudinal cohort study","With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, growing evidence shows that a considerable proportion of people who have recovered from COVID-19 have long-term effects on multiple organs and systems. A few longitudinal studies have reported on the persistent health effects of COVID-19, but the follow-up was limited to 1 year after acute infection. The aim of our study was to characterise the longitudinal evolution of health outcomes in hospital survivors with different initial disease severity throughout 2 years after acute COVID-19 infection and to determine their recovery status. We did an ambidirectional, longitudinal cohort study of individuals who had survived hospitalisation with COVID-19 and who had been discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital (Wuhan, China) between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. We measured health outcomes 6 months (June 16-Sept 3, 2020), 12 months (Dec 16, 2020-Feb 7, 2021), and 2 years (Nov 16, 2021-Jan 10, 2022) after symptom onset with a 6-min walking distance (6MWD) test, laboratory tests, and a series of questionnaires on symptoms, mental health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), return to work, and health-care use after discharge. A subset of COVID-19 survivors received pulmonary function tests and chest imaging at each visit. Age-matched, sex-matched, and comorbidities-matched participants without COVID-19 infection (controls) were introduced to determine the recovery status of COVID-19 survivors at 2 years. The primary outcomes included symptoms, modified British Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, HRQoL, 6MWD, and return to work, and were assessed in all COVID-19 survivors who attended all three follow-up visits. Symptoms, mMRC dyspnoea scale, and HRQoL were also assessed in controls. 2469 patients with COVID-19 were discharged from Jin Yin-tan Hospital between Jan 7 and May 29, 2020. 1192 COVID-19 survivors completed assessments at the three follow-up visits and were included in the final analysis, 1119 (94%) of whom attended the face-to-face interview 2 years after infection. The median age at discharge was 57Ã‚Â·0 years (48Ã‚Â·0-65Ã‚Â·0) and 551 (46%) were women. The median follow-up time after symptom onset was 185Ã‚Â·0 days (IQR 175Ã‚Â·0-197Ã‚Â·0) for the visit at 6 months, 349Ã‚Â·0 days (337Ã‚Â·0-360Ã‚Â·0) for the visit at 12 months, and 685Ã‚Â·0 days (675Ã‚Â·0-698Ã‚Â·0) for the visit at 2 years. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with at least one sequelae symptom decreased significantly from 777 (68%) of 1149 at 6 months to 650 (55%) of 1190 at 2 years (p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001), with fatigue or muscle weakness always being the most frequent. The proportion of COVID-19 survivors with an mMRC score of at least 1 was 168 (14%) of 1191 at 2 years, significantly lower than the 288 (26%) of 1104 at 6 months (p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). HRQoL continued to improve in almost all domains, especially in terms of anxiety or depression: the proportion of individuals with symptoms of anxiety or depression decreased from 256 (23%) of 1105 at 6 months to 143 (12%) 1191 at 2 years (p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001). The proportion of individuals with a 6MWD less than the lower limit of the normal range declined continuously in COVID-19 survivors overall and in the three subgroups of varying initial disease severity. 438 (89%) of 494 COVID-19 survivors had returned to their original work at 2 years. Survivors with long COVID symptoms at 2 years had lower HRQoL, worse exercise capacity, more mental health abnormality, and increased health-care use after discharge than survivors without long COVID symptoms. COVID-19 survivors still had more prevalent symptoms and more problems in pain or discomfort, as well as anxiety or depression, at 2 years than did controls. Additionally, a significantly higher proportion of survivors who had received higher-level respiratory support during hospitalisation had lung diffusion impairment (43 [65%] of 66 vs 24 [36%] of 66, p=0Ã‚Â·0009), reduced residual volume (41 [62%] vs 13 [20%], p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001), and total lung capacity (26 [39%] vs four [6%], p&lt;0Ã‚Â·0001) than did controls. Regardless of initial disease severity, COVID-19 survivors had longitudinal improvements in physical and mental health, with most returning to their original work within 2 years; however, the burden of symptomatic sequelae remained fairly high. COVID-19 survivors had a remarkably lower health status than the general population at 2 years. The study findings indicate that there is an urgent need to explore the pathogenesis of long COVID and develop effective interventions to reduce the risk of long COVID.","Huang, Li, Gu, Zhang, Ren, Guo, Liu, Wang, Cui, Wang, Zhang, Shang, Zhong, Wang, Wang, Cao","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-2600(22)00126-6","20220514","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31434,""

"Patterns and predictors of alcohol use during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia: Longitudinal cohort study","The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in disruptions across many life domains. The distress associated with the pandemic itself, and public health efforts to manage the outbreak, may result in increased alcohol use. This study aimed to quantify changes in alcohol use during the early stages of the pandemic and factors associated with different patterns of use. Data were obtained from a longitudinal survey of a representative Australian adult sample (N=1296, 50% female, M<sub>age</sub> =46.0) conducted from March-June 2020, during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia. Change in alcohol consumption (AUDIT-C) was examined using AUDIT-C scores from waves one, three, five and seven of the study, each 4Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks apart. Factors associated with alcohol were examined, including depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) symptoms, health risk tolerance, stress and coping, work and social impairment (WSAS), COVID impacts, and socio-demographic variables. For most participants, alcohol use did not increase during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. COVID-19 exposure, higher perceived coping, depression symptoms, and male gender were associated with greater odds of increasing or elevated levels of alcohol use. Social changes including working from home had mixed effects of alcohol consumption. Although no evidence was found for increased alcohol use overall during the early months of the pandemic, several factors were associated with alcohol consumption at risky levels. Greater understanding of motivations for drinking across public and private contexts, along with targeted support for high-risk groups may assist in reducing harm associated with alcohol consumption.","Batterham, Shou, Farrer, Murray, Morse, Gulliver, Slade, Newton, Calear","https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.14858","20220514",".alcohol use; COVID-19 pandemic; lockdowns; representative national sample","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31436,""
"Implementation of Mental Health Centres Pilots in Poland since 2018: A Chance to Move towards Community-Based Mental Health Services","Provision of mental health care in Poland has long been characterised by an overreliance on psychiatric hospitals and the underdevelopment of community care. The introduction of the first National Mental Health Protection Programme for 2011-2015, with the explicit goal to base provision of mental care on the community mental health centres, failed to achieve any tangible results. The ensuing critique led to the launch of the second National Mental Health Protection Programme for 2017-2022 and the establishment, from mid-2018 onwards, of 41 (33 in operation) mental health centres across Poland. These will be piloted until the end of 2022 but have already shown positive results in terms of access to non-stationary care and a small fall in hospitalisations. They have also performed well during the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing for a quick reorganization of care and continued provision of mental health services. Some of the key innovations of the new model include the introduction of recovery assistants (a new profession) and mental health coordinators (a new role); liaison with social assistance services; and a shift to budget financing. The key obstacles to the national rollout of mental health centres are the low financing of mental health care in Poland, which is among the lowest in Europe, and acute workforce shortages.","Sagan, Kowalska-Bobko, Biechowska, Rogala, GaÃ…â€šÃ„â€¦zka-Sobotka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095774","20220514","Poland; coordination; healthcare; integrated care; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31437,""
"Assessment of Acceptability and Initial Effectiveness of a Unified Protocol Prevention Program to Train Emotional Regulation Skills in Female Nursing Professionals during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Healthcare professionals, especially women, have shown increases in anxious-depressive symptoms as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of a Unified Protocol (UP) prevention program to provide emotional regulation skills to cope with stressful situations. The sample consisted of 27 nursing professionals (100% women; mean age: 45.67; SD = 7.71) working in a Spanish public hospital during COVID-19, who were randomized to an immediate treatment group (ITG, <i>n</i> = 13) or to a delayed treatment group (DTG, <i>n</i> = 14, which served as the waiting list control group and received the program 5 weeks after the ITG had received it). The program consisted of five-weekly, two-hour, UP-based group sessions. Variables related to emotional symptomatology, emotional regulation, personality, burnout, and perceived quality of life were evaluated at the following time points: pre- and post-intervention and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups. Statistically significant between-group differences showed lower emotional exhaustion and personal accomplishment in favor of the ITG after the intervention. Regarding the effect over time for all participants who received the UP (<i>n</i> = 27), statistically significant reductions were observed in neuroticism, personal accomplishment, and subjective distress caused by traumatic events (-0.23 Ã¢â€°Â¤ <i>d</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ -0.73). A statistically significant interaction ""Time*Condition"" was found in anxiety, with increases in the DTG. Participants showed high satisfaction with the UP. These findings show good acceptability and preliminary effectiveness of the UP to reduce the emotional impact of the pandemic in female nursing workers.","Ferreres-GalÃƒÂ¡n, Navarro-Haro, Peris-Baquero, GuillÃƒÂ©n-MarÃƒÂ­n, de Luna-Hermoso, Osma","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19095715","20220514","COVID-19 pandemic; emotion regulation skills; nursing professionals; prevention; unified protocol","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31438,""

"Child's Play: Examining the Association Between Time Spent Playing and Child Mental Health","It is theorised that adventurous play offers learning opportunities that help to prevent mental health problems in children. In this study, data from two samples is used to examine associations between the time that children aged 5-11Ã‚Â years spent playing adventurously and their mental health. For comparison, time spent playing unadventurously and time spent playing outdoors are also examined. Study 1 includes a sample of 417 parents, Study 2 includes data from a nationally representative sample of 1919 parents. Small, significant associations between adventurous play and internalising problems, as well as positive affect during the first UK-wide Covid-19 lockdown, were found; children who spend more time playing adventurously had fewer internalising problems and more positive affect during the Covid-19 lockdown. Study 2 showed that these associations were stronger for children from lower income families than for children from higher income families.

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) at 3Ã‚Â months after hospital discharge, in a cohort of mechanically ventilated patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). AnÃ‚Â ambispective, observational study wasÃ‚Â conducted in three hospitals with intensive care unit (ICU) follow-up clinics. We studied adults who survived a critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. A physical (muscle strength and pulmonary function), functional [12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and Barthel score], psychological [hospital anxiety and depression (HADS) and posttraumatic stress disorder symptom severity scales], and cognitive [Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) test] assessment were performed. A total of 186 patients were evaluated at 88Ã‚Â days (IQR 68-121) after hospital discharge. Mean age was 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã‚Â years old, 126 (68%) patients were men, and median length of mechanical ventilation was 14Ã‚Â days (IQR 8-31). About 3 out of 4 patients (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°139, 75%) met PICS criteria. Symptoms of cognitive and psychiatric disorders were found in 59 (32%) and 58 (31%) patients, respectively. Ninety-one (49%) patients had muscle weakness. Pulmonary function tests in patients with no respiratory comorbidities showed a normal pattern in 93 (50%) patients, and a restrictive disorder in 62 (33%) patients. Also, 69 patients (37%) were on sick leave, while 32 (17%) had resumed work at the time of assessment. In conclusion,Ã‚Â survivors of critical illness due to SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring mechanical ventilation have a high prevalence of PICS. Physical domain is the most frequently damaged, followed by cognitive and psychiatric disorders. ICU follow-up clinics enable the assistance of this vulnerable population.","Nanwani-Nanwani, LÃƒÂ³pez-PÃƒÂ©rez, GimÃƒÂ©nez-Esparza, Ruiz-Barranco, Carrillo, Arellano, DÃƒÂ­az-DÃƒÂ­az, Hurtado, GarcÃƒÂ­a-MuÃƒÂ±oz, Relucio, Quintana-DÃƒÂ­az, ÃƒÅ¡rbez, Saravia, Bonan, GarcÃƒÂ­a-RÃƒÂ­o, Testillano, Villar, GarcÃƒÂ­a de Lorenzo, AÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³n","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-11929-8","20220513","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31441,""
"Delivering a psychosocial program for older people living in retirement homes during the Covid-19 pandemic: A process evaluation and recommendations for community interventions","The Covid-19 pandemic lockdown regulations caused retirement homes to temporarily ban in-person visitation potentially increasing the mental health risks of older people. An opportunity arose for a multistakeholder community collaboration to design a mental health program for older people. To evaluate the process of delivering a 12-week psychosocial program aimed at preventing loneliness, countering boredom, and providing older people in restricted settings with education about Covid-19 during the lockdown, in Durban, South Africa. A qualitative retrospective design was used. Data from two focus groups and six semistructured individual interviews conducted with stakeholders (volunteers, social workers, and residents) postproject were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Stakeholders had varied experiences of the project, in terms of content, processes of engagement, and implementation, resulting in five themes. The study concluded with recommendations. A strong need exists for multistakeholder community collaborations when implementing a program where the context restricts physical access.","Jarvis, Pillay, Norton, Hiraman, Baloyi","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22876","20220513","Covid-19; aged; community; loneliness; process evaluation; psychosocial program; residential care facilities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31442,""

"Relationship Status-based Health Disparities during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Previous research finds that marriage is a privileged family form with health benefits. These health advantages may have shifted during the pandemic, as more time was spent at home and resources strained. This study compares differences in three health outcomes across relationship statuses between April and December 2020 using a nationally-representative US survey, the Household Pulse Survey (N = 1,422,733). As the pandemic progressed, larger differences emerged when comparing married and never married respondentsâ€™ probabilities of fair or poor health, depression, and anxiety as never married people had the steepest decline in health, even adjusting for pandemic-related stressors (e.g., food insufficiency). Yet, widowed and divorced/separated respondentsâ€™ greater probabilities of these three health outcomes compared to married respondentsâ€™ narrowed over this same period. During the pandemic, relationship status and self-rated health patterns were similar for men and women, but for mental health there was evidence that the growing advantage of marriage relative to never being married was more pronounced for men, whereas the shrinking advantage of marriage relative to being previously married was more pronounced for women. This study identifies the unique health needs for never married adults during the pandemic, demonstrating that social conditions around the pandemic likely exacerbated health disparities by relationship status.","Mieke Beth Thomeer","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E020A-25F-C46","20220514","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; marriage; mental health; family; self-rated health; health disparities; covid-19; gender; depression; marital status; household pulse survey","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-15","",31444,""
