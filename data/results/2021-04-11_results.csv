"Incidence of Long-term Post-acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Related to Pain and Other Symptoms: A Living Systematic Review and Meta-analysis","Importance: Persistent symptoms are reported in patients who survive the initial stage of COVID-19, often referred to as ''long COVID'' or ''post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection'' (PASC); however, evidence on incidence is still lacking, and symptoms relevant to pain are yet to be assessed. Objective: To determine long-term symptoms in COVID-19 survivors after infection. Data Sources: A literature search was performed using the electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and CHINAL and preprint servers MedR{chi}iv and BioR{chi}iv through January 15, 2021. Study Selection: Eligible studies were those reporting patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and who showed any symptoms persisting beyond the acute phase. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Incidence rate of symptoms were pooled using inverse variance methods with a DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was pain-related symptoms such as headache or myalgia. Secondary outcomes were symptoms relevant to pain (depression or muscle weakness) and symptoms frequently reported (anosmia and dyspnea). Heterogeneity among studies and publication bias for each symptom were estimated. The source of heterogeneity was explored using meta-regression, with follow-up period, age and sex as covariates. Results: In total, 35 studies including 18,711 patients were eligible. Eight pain-related symptoms and 26 other symptoms were identified. The highest pooled incidence among pain-related symptoms was chest pain (17%, 95% CI, 12%-25%), followed by headache (16%, 95% CI, 9%-27%), arthralgia (13%, 95% CI, 7%-24%), neuralgia (12%, 95% CI, 3%-38%) and abdominal pain (11%, 95% CI, 7%-16%). The highest pooled incidence among other symptoms was fatigue (45%, 95% CI, 32%-59%), followed by insomnia (26%, 95% CI, 9%-57%), dyspnea (25%, 95% CI, 15%-38%), weakness (25%, 95% CI, 8%-56%) and anosmia (19%, 95% CI, 13%-27%). Substantial heterogeneity was identified (I2, 50-100%). Meta-regression analyses partially accounted for the source of heterogeneity, and yet, 53% of the symptoms remained unexplained. Conclusions and Relevance: The current meta-analysis may provide a complete picture of incidence in PASC. It remains unclear, however, whether post-COVID symptoms progress or regress over time or to what extent PASC are associated with age or sex.","Hiroshi Hoshijima; Takahiro Mihara; Hiroyuki Seki; Shunsuke Hyuga; Norifumi Kuratani; Toshiya Shiga","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.08.21255109","20210411","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-11","",12808,""

"Complementary and alternative medicine therapies and COVID-19: a systematic review","Despite the high prevalence of coronavirus and various treatment approaches, including complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), there is still no definitive treatment for coronavirus. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of CAM interventions on COVID-19 patients. Four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE) were searched from the inception of databases until July 16, 2020. Keywords included complementary and alternative medicine therapies and Coronavirus. Of the 1,137 studies searched, 14 studies performed on 972 COVID-19 patients entered the systematic review final stage. The results showed that different CAM interventions (acupuncture, Traditional Chinese medicine [TCM], relaxation, Qigong) significantly improved various psychological symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, negative emotions, quality of life) and physical symptoms (inflammatory factors, physical activity, chest pain, and respiratory function) in COVID-19 patients. The results showed that various CAM interventions have a positive effect on improving the various dimensions of coronavirus disease but since there are few studies in this regard, further studies using different CAM approaches are recommended.","Badakhsh, Dastras, Sarchahi, Doostkami, Mir, Bouya","https://doi.org/10.1515/reveh-2021-0012","20210410","COVID-19; alternative medicine; complementary therapies; coronavirus","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-11","",12810,""
"A randomized clinical trial evaluating the immunomodulatory effect of convalescent plasma on COVID-19-related cytokine storm","Evaluating the effect of convalescent plasma (CP) on some cytokine storm indices in severe COVID-19 patients. Totally, 62 patients were randomly assigned into two groups for this clinical trial. Patients in the intervention group received one unit (500Ã‚Â mL) plasma on the admission day plus standard drugs while the controls merely received standard treatments. Eventually, primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated. In the CP group, compared with controls, the mean levels of lymphocytes and IL-10 significantly increased while the levels of IL-6, TNF-ÃŽÂ±, and IFN-ÃŽÂ³ decreased (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). The length of in-hospital stay, and mortality rate did not significantly reduce in the CP group compared with controls (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) while WHO severity scores remarkably improved (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01), despite the higher frequency of underlying diseases among the CP group (66.7%) vs. controls (33.3%). Although CP has a remarkable immunomodulatory and antiviral potential to improve the cytokine storm and disease severity in COVID-19 patients, it did not considerably affect the mortality rate.","Pouladzadeh, Safdarian, Eshghi, Abolghasemi, Bavani, Sheibani, Moradi Choghakabodi, Feghhi, Ghafourian Boroujerdnia, Forouzan, Jalali Far, Kaydani, Rajaei, Amin, Torabizadeh, Yousefi, Hadaddezfuli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11739-021-02734-8","20210410","COVID-19; Convalescent plasma; Cytokine storm","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-11","",12811,""
"COVID-19-Related Occupational Burnout and Moral Distress among Nurses: A Rapid Scoping Review","The COVID-19 pandemic is placing unprecedented pressure on a nursing workforce that is already under considerable mental strain due to an overloaded system. Convergent evidence from the current and previous pandemics indicates that nurses experience the highest levels of psychological distress compared with other health professionals. Nurse leaders face particular challenges in mitigating risk and supporting nursing staff to negotiate moral distress and fatigue during large-scale, sustained crises. Synthesizing the burgeoning literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress faced by nurses and identifying effective interventions to reduce poor mental health outcomes will enable nurse leaders to support the resilience of their teams. This paper aims to (1) synthesize existing literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress among nurses and (2) identify recommendations for nurse leaders to support the psychological needs of nursing staff. Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and PsycINFO (via Ovid); CINAHL (via EBSCOHost); and ERIC (via ProQUEST). The rapid review was completed in accordance with the World Health Organization Rapid Review Guide. Thematic analysis of selected studies suggests that nurses are at an increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Younger female nurses with less clinical experience are more vulnerable to adverse mental health outcomes.","Sriharan, West, Almost, Hamza","https://doi.org/10.12927/cjnl.2021.26459","20210410","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-11","",12812,""
"Trauma Exposure and the PTSD symptoms of College Teachers During the Peak of the COVID-19 Outbreak","This study aimed to explore influencing factors for the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Wuhan college teachers, post-traumatic stress symptoms in particular, so as to inform evidence-based strategy development to ameliorate such adverse impacts. An online survey was conducted from 26 to 29 April 2020, and 1650 teachers (47.54% male; M=40.28 years, SD=8.3 years) enrolled in Wuhan universities and colleges participated. The results showed that the overall incidence of PTSD among college teachers was as high as 24.55%, but the average level of PTSD score was low (M=1.06, SD=0.72). Logistic regression analysis showed that for those with confirmed COVID-19, the ratio was much higher, up to 2.814 (95% CI (1.542, 5.136), p &lt; 0.001); that is, compared with those without symptoms, the ratio of PTSD increased by 181%.For those who had family members or relatives who died of COVID-19, the ratio was 5.592 (95% CI [2.271, 13.766], p &lt; 0.001), 459% higher than those who had no one who died. But the living places during the pandemic had no significant effect on PTSD. The findings suggest that mental health services reducing PTSD should be provided. Teachers who confirmed COVID-19 or lost loved ones to COVID-19 should be given particular care. This article is protected by copyright.

"Job transitions and mental health outcomes among US adults aged 55 and older during the COVID-19 pandemic","Adults around retirement age are especially vulnerable to the effects of the recent economic downturn associated with COVID-19. This study investigated disturbances to working life and mental health among Americans aged Ã¢â€°Â¥55 during early months of the pandemic. Using data from the nation-wide COVID-19 Coping Study (N=6,264), we examined rates of job loss, furloughs, hour/income reductions, and work-from-home, along with unchanged work status, by age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, and occupation. We next described sources of worry by job transition group and tested the adjusted associations of COVID-19-related job transitions with life satisfaction, loneliness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. Most job loss occurred among respondents under age 65 and those without college degrees. Job loss and reduced hours/income were more common among Hispanics compared to other racial/ethnic groups, and work-from-home transitions were most common among respondents with high educational attainment and jobs in government- and education-related occupations. Workers who lost their jobs had the lowest life satisfaction and the highest loneliness and depressive symptoms, followed by workers who were furloughed and workers with reduced hours/income. Work-from-home was associated with more anxiety than unchanged work. COVID-19-related job transitions are detrimental to mental health, even when they might keep workers safe. These results enhance our understanding of the potentially long-term mental health effects of social and economic aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need for economic and mental health support for aging Americans.","Abrams, Finlay, Kobayashi","https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbab060","20210410","Coronavirus; Depression; Employment; Retirement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-11","",12814,""
"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among general Bangladeshi population: a cross-sectional study","Mental health problems significantly increased worldwide during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. At the early stage of the outbreak, the government of Bangladesh imposed lockdown and quarantine approaches to prevent the spread of the virus, which impacted people's daily life and health. The COVID-19 pandemic has also affected people's economic status, healthcare facilities and other lifestyle factors in Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health among the Bangladeshi population. We conducted an online cross-sectional survey among 672 Bangladeshi people aged between 15 and 65 years all over the country from 15 April to 10 May 2020. After obtaining electronic consent, we conducted a survey assessing people's sociodemographic profiles and psychometric measures. We used The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale-8, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index to assess loneliness, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance, respectively. The prevalence of loneliness, depression, anxiety and sleep disturbance was estimated at 71% (mild: 32%, moderate: 29%, severe: 10%), 38% (mild: 24%, moderate: 11%, severe: 3%), 64% (mild: 30%, moderate: 17%, severe: 17%) and 73% (mild: 50%, moderate: 18%, severe: 5%), respectively. In Bangladesh, the key factors associated with poor mental health during COVID-19 were female sex, unemployment, being a student, obesity and living without a family. The present study also identified statistically significant interrelationships among the measured mental health issues. A large portion of respondents reported mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. The present study suggests longitudinal assessments of mental health among Bangladeshi people to determine the gravity of this issue during and after the pandemic. Appropriate supportive programmes and interventional approaches would address mental health problems in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Das, Hasan, Daria, Islam","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045727","20210410","COVID-19; adult psychiatry; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-04-11","",12815,""
