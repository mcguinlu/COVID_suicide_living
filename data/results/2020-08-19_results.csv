"Impact of COVID-19 on Public Mental Health and the Buffering Effect of a Sense of Coherence","It is claimed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on mental health. However, to date, prospective studies are lacking. Moreover, it is important to identify which factors modulate the stress response to the pandemic. Previously, sense of coherence (SOC) has emerged as a particularly important resistance factor. This prospective study aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on mental health and to investigate the ability of pre-outbreak SOC levels to predict changes in psychopathological symptoms. This study assessed psychopathological symptoms and SOC before and after the COVID-19 outbreak as well as post-outbreak COVID-19-related traumatic distress in a German-speaking sample (n =1,591). Bivariate latent change score (BLCS) modeling was used to analyze pre- to post-outbreak changes in psychopathological symptoms and the ability of SOC to predict symptom changes. Overall, there was no change in psychopathological symptoms. However, on an individual-respondent level, 10% experienced a clinically significant increase in psychopathological symptoms and 15% met cut-off criteria for COVID-19-related traumatic distress. Using BLCS modeling, we identified a high-stress group experiencing an increase in psychopathological symptoms and a decrease in SOC and a low-stress group showing the reversed pattern. Changes in SOC and psychopathological symptoms were predicted by pre-outbreak SOC and psychopathological symptom levels. Although mental health was stable in most respondents, a small group of respondents characterized by low levels of SOC experienced increased psychopathological symptoms from pre- to post-outbreak. Thus, SOC training might be a promising approach to enhance the resistance to stressors.","SchÃƒÂ¤fer, Sopp, Schanz, Staginnus, GÃƒÂ¶ritz, Michael","https://doi.org/10.1159/000510752","20200818","COVID-19; Mental health; Prospective; Psychopathology; Sense of coherence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-19","",3980,""

"Coronaphobia among healthcare professionals in Mexico: A psychometric analysis","The present study examined the validity of the coronaphobia phenomenon with healthcare professionals using a psychometric approach. Using SurveyMonkey, an adapted version of the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale-Healthcare version (CAS-HC) was administered to 231 adult healthcare professionals in Mexico. Confirmatory factor analysis demonstrated that dysfunctional coronavirus anxiety symptoms cohered into a reliable, single factor structure of coronaphobia. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the classification features of the CAS-HC were strong, but supported a less stringent cut-score for this population. Construct validity was supported by the positive correlations between the CAS-HC and measures of depression and generalized anxiety, while known groups validity was found with high CAS-HC scores exhibited by those working in emergency rooms, triage, and intensive care units. The findings collectively support the coronaphobia construct with healthcare professionals, and the finding that over one third of the participants in the study scored in the clinical range on this measure points to the critical importance of assessing and alleviating this form of distress in this vulnerable but indispensable workforce.","Mora-MagaÃƒÂ±a, Lee, Maldonado-Castellanos, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Gutierrez, Mendez-Venegas, Maya-Del-Moral, Rosas-Munive, Mathis, Jobe","https://doi.org/10.1080/07481187.2020.1808762","20200818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-19","",3983,""
"Pandemic buying: Testing a psychological model of over-purchasing and panic buying using data from the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic","Over-purchasing and hoarding of necessities is a common response to crises, especially in developed economies where there is normally an expectation of plentiful supply. This behaviour was observed internationally early on in the COVID-19 pandemic. In the absence of actual scarcity, this behaviour can be described as â€˜panic buyingâ€™ and can lead to temporary shortages. However, there have been few psychological studies of this phenomenon. We propose a psychological model of over-purchasing informed by animal foraging theory and make predictions about variables that predict over-purchasing by either exacerbating or mitigating the anticipation of future scarcity. These variables include additional scarcity cues (e.g. loss of income), distress (e.g. depression), psychological factors that draw attention to these cues (e.g. neuroticism) or to reassuring messages (eg. analytical reasoning) or which facilitate over-purchasing (e.g. income). We tested our model in parallel nationally representative internet surveys of the adult general population conducted in the United Kingdom (UK: N = 2025) and the Republic of Ireland (RoI: N = 1041) 52 and 31 days after the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 were detected in the UK and RoI, respectively. About three quarters of participants reported no or very little over-purchasing. More over-purchasing in RoI may have reflected different government messaging or historical factors. When over-purchasing occurred, it was observed across a wide range of product categories and was accounted for by a single latent factor. It was positively predicted by household income, the presence of children at home, psychological distress (depression, death anxiety), threat sensitivity (right wing authoritarianism) and mistrust of others (paranoia). Analytic reasoning ability had an inhibitory effect. Predictor variables accounted for 36% and 34% of the variance in over-purchasing in the UK and RoI respectively. With some caveats, the data supported our model and point to strategies to mitigate over-purchasing in future crises.","Richard Bentall et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46216-035-A5C","20200819","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Cognitive Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Consumer Psychology; over-purchasing; general population; psychological; panic buying; pandemic; coronavirus; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-19","",3984,""

No interpretation regarding the symptoms was offered. Unfortunately, this man did not come for follow up. But there were others whom I have followed up for longer periods, and I have reported three such cases of drug resistant depression, who were utterly hopeless but showed a sharp improvement with MACI. In common mental illnesses (depression and anxiety, alcohol and tobacco use), such sharp improvements are often observed with MACI. Not so sharp but consistent improvements occurred in some other instances. As a social tool MACI has the potential to change the discourse in the field of healthâ€”and this is equally true for mental health.","Atul Agarwal","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46052-821-79A","20200819","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-19","",3985,""
