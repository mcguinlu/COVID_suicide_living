"Self-reported adaptability among postgraduate dental learners and their instructors: accelerated change induced by COVID-19","It is forecasted that the skills and competencies necessary for post-pandemic success in higher education need to be founded upon adaptability, coping, and Self-regulated Learning (SRL). It is worth investigating how stakeholders perceived their adaptability and coping with the accelerated change accompanying COVID-19. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to assess the self-reported adaptability of postgraduate dental learners and their instructors in the context of abrupt transition to distance learning induced by the pandemic. This study utilized a convergent mixed methods study design. The qualitative and quantitative data were concurrently collected from instructors and learners. The datasets were analyzed independently, and the generated information was integrated using a joint model analysis. The percentage of average of self-reported adaptability of both groups was 81.15%. The instructors, with a mean of satisfaction of 17.94 (1.76), rated their adaptability significantly higher than the learners, with a mean of satisfaction of 15.66 (2.77) (p=0.002). The thematic analysis resulted in two interrelated themes: Self and Environment. Within the Self theme, three subthemes surfaced: Cognitions, Emotions, Behaviors. As for the Environment theme, it encapsulated two subthemes: Enablers and Impediments. The stakeholders perceived themselves to have adapted well to the transition, and SRL appeared as a cornerstone in the adaptation to the accelerated change (accompanying COVID-19). There appeared to be an interplay between the cognitions, emotions, and behaviors on the level of the self as part of the adaptation process. Also, building upon existent models of SRL, this study uncovered that the stakeholders considered the environment to play a crucial role in their adaptation process. This highlights the importance of developing a climate that remains, despite external pressures, conducive to attaining learning and teaching goals. It is also crucial for university-level mental health promotion activities to proactively foster, among learners and instructors, adaptability, building academic resilience.","Farah Otaki; Fatemeh Amir-Rad; Manal Al-Halabi; Zaid Baqain; Nabil Zary","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.05.21258401","20210607","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14387,""
"Revealing public opinion towards COVID-19 vaccines using Twitter data in the United States: a spatiotemporal perspective","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a large, initially uncontrollable, public health crisis both in the United States (US) and across the world, with experts looking to vaccines as the ultimate mechanism of defense. The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance. Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines by investigating the spatiotemporal trends of their sentiment and emotion towards vaccines, as well as how such trends relate to popular topics on Twitter in the US. Methods: We collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the US from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified three phases along the pandemic timeline with the significant changes of public sentiment and emotion. We further linked the changes to eleven key events and major topics as the potential drivers to induce such changes via cloud mapping of keywords and topic modeling. Results: An increasing trend of positive sentiment in parallel with the decrease of negative sentiment are generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards COVID-19 vaccines. The overall tendency of the eight types of emotion implies the trustiness and anticipation of the public to vaccination, accompanied by the mixture of fear, sadness and anger. Critical social/international events and/or the announcements of political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on the public opinion on vaccines. These factors, along with important topics and manual reading of popular posts on eleven key events, help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis. Conclusions: The analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics and promote the confidence of individuals within a certain region or community, towards vaccines.","Tao Hu; Siqin Wang; Wei Luo; Yingwei Yan; Mengxi Zhang; Xiao Huang; Regina Liu; Kelly Ly; Viraj Kacker; Zhelong Li","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.02.21258233","20210607","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14388,""

"Universal COVID-19 testing and a three-space triage protocol is associated with a nine-fold decrease in possible nosocomial infections in an inpatient psychiatric facility","In May of 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMSA) issued guidelines for state psychiatric hospitals, recommending that these facilities adopt universal testing for COVID-19 and &quot;three-space&quot; triage protocols for dedicated COVID-19 positive, negative, and quarantine spaces to mitigate the risk of nosocomial infection. The Westchester Behavioral Health Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital (WBHC-NYP) adopted a comprehensive infection control protocol consistent with these recommendations in April, 2020. We reviewed the records of 1,139 patients treated on the inpatient service at WBHC-NYP between March 14th and June 10<sup>th</sup>, 2020, dates corresponding to the first COVID-19 surge in the New York City metropolitan region. The incidence of detected nosocomial or possible nosocomial infections before and during the implementation of the protocol was 0.096 (16/167), or 0.96 infections per 10 at-risk patients. The incidence of nosocomial or possible nosocomial infections after complete implementation was 0.0110 (2/182), or 1.1 infections per 100 at-risk patients. The difference in incidence between the two time points was statistically significant (p&lt;.0003) and represents a 9-fold decrease.

"The Psychological Well-Being of Medical Versus Dental GME Residents During the COVID 19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","Trainees are facingÃ‚Â isolation, burnout, due to the fear of contracting and transmitting novel coronavirus-19 (COVID-19).Ã‚Â There has been a reduction in clinical activities of residents.Ã‚Â The purpose of this paper is to measure and compare the psychological well-being of dental versus medical residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. This is a cross-sectional study whereby trainees of a hospital in New York City were sent a questionnaire. Participants were from the dental and medical departments. Psychological measures of depression and PTSD were assessed utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) questionnaire. Other variables compared were age, gender, smoking status, living situation and comorbidities. Data analysis utilized chi-squared (X<sup>2</sup>) and t-tests. Bivariate correlation and linear regression analyses was also utilized. The survey was sent to 19 dental (Dental) and 171 medical (MD) residents. There were 66 participants. The response rate was 63.16 and 35.09% for the Dental and MD residents, respectively. The mean age for the Dental and MD residents, respectively, was 29.62 Ã‚Â± 2.09 and 34.82 Ã‚Â± 9.32 (P = .014). Eighty-one percent of the Dental respondents were male and 33.3% of the MD respondents were male (P &lt; .001).Ã‚Â The mean PHQ-9 score was 18.29 Ã‚Â± 2.88 vs 7.24 Ã‚Â± 7.41 for Dental and MD residents, respectively (P &lt; .001).

"Long-term consequences in critically ill COVID-19 patients: a prospective cohort study","COVID-19 can cause severe disease with need of treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) for several weeks. Increased knowledge is needed about the long-term consequences. This is a single-center prospective follow-up study of COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU for respiratory organ support between March and July 2020. Patients with invasive ventilation were compared with those with high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) regarding functional outcome and health-related qualify of life. The mean follow-up time was 5 months after ICU discharge and included clinical history, three well-validated questionnaires about health-related quality of life and psychological health, pulmonary function test, 6-minute walk test (6MWT) and work ability. Data were analyzed with multivariable general linear and logistic regression models with 95% confidence intervals. Among 248 ICU patients, 200 patients survived. Of these, 113 patients came for follow-up. Seventy patients (62%) had received invasive ventilation. Most patients reported impaired health-related quality of life. Approximately one third suffered from posttraumatic stress, anxiety and depression. Twenty-six percent had reduced total lung capacity, 34% had reduced 6MWT and 50% worked fulltime. The outcomes were similar regardless of ventilatory support, but invasive ventilation was associated with more bodily pain (MSD -19, 95% CI: -32 to -5) and &lt;80% total lung capacity (OR 4.1, 95% CI: 1.3-16.5).

"Recovery from COVID-19-related olfactory disorders and quality of life: insights from an observational online study","Although olfactory disorders (OD) are among the most significant symptoms of COVID-19, recovery time from COVID-19 related OD as well as their consequences on the quality of life remain poorly documented. We investigated the characteristics and behavioral consequences of COVID-19 related OD using a large-scale study involving 3111 French respondents (78% women) to an online questionnaire over a period of 9 months covering different epidemic waves (from April 8 th 2020 to January 13 th 2021). In the patients who subjectively recovered from COVID-19 related OD (N = 609), recovery occurred on average after 16 days and most of the time within one month (&quot;normal&quot; recovery range); 49 subjectively recovered in 1 to 2.5 months, and several cases took up to 6.5 months. Among the patients with ongoing OD (N = 2502), 974 were outside the &quot;normal&quot; recovery range (persistent OD) and reported OD for 1 to 10 months. Developing a persistent OD was more likely with increasing age and in women, and was more often associated with parosmia and phantosmia. The deleterious impact of COVID-19 related OD on the quality of life was significantly aggravated by OD duration, and was more pronounced in women. Because persistent OD is not infrequent after COVID-19, has deleterious consequences on the quality of life, and receives few solutions from the health practitioners, it would be beneficial to implement screening and treatment programs to minimize the long-term behavioral consequences of COVID-19 related OD.","Ferdenzi, Bousquet, Aguera, Dantec, DaudÃƒÂ©, Fornoni, Fournel, Kassan, Mantel, Moranges, Moussy, Richard OrtegÃƒÂ³n, Rouby, Bensafi","https://doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjab028","20210607","COVID-19; mental health; quality of life; self-report; smell loss","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14393,""
"Association between well-being and compliance with COVID-19 preventive measures by healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study","Knowledge and attitude influence compliance and individuals' practices. The risk and protective factors associated with high compliance to these preventive measures are critical to enhancing pandemic preparedness.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, resilience and depression in health professionals: a cross-sectional study","To describe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stress, resilience and depression in health professionals from a public hospital in Barcelona, Spain after the first peak of pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic in Spain has pushed boundaries in health systems and, especially, for health professionals. Analysis of resilience as an individual resource and it is essential to understand the mechanisms that make staff react unfavourably to stressors caused by the pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed. Health professionals supervised by the nursing department, including registered nurses, health care assistants, health technicians, final year nurse student nurses, foreign nurses, and other nurse-related health workers. The study complies with the STROBE checklist for cross-sectional studies. An online survey was administered to all health professionals supervised by the nursing department between 6 and 27 May 2020. The survey included the ER-14 Resilience Scale, the widely-used PHQ-9 depression scale, the Spanish version of the Nursing Stress Scale, and an ad-hoc questionnaire to obtain sociodemographic and occupational variables. A total of 686 participants answered the survey. Resilience was high or very high in health professionals, with an inverse correlation with stress and depression scores. Personal on fixed shifts showed better resilience. The most stressed health professionals were full-time registered nurses, followed by health care assistants. Up to 25% of nursing professionals had depression. Our study showed a high degree of resilience among nurse professionals despite the overwhelming nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. Relevant signs of depression and stress were detected among participants. Occupational factors heavily influenced nurses' resilience, stress and depression. Government policy shifts are needed in Spain to improve nurses' workforce conditions, enhance the ratio of nurses to patient numbers, and avoid workforce losses.

We assessed OCD symptom severity and FA of the live-in family members, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress levels and COVID-19 related psychological distress of patients and family members at four different timepoints: one month after the start of the lockdown (T<sub>1</sub>), during the gradual relaxation (T<sub>2</sub>), between the two waves (T<sub>3</sub>) and during the second wave (T<sub>4</sub>). Results showed that although COVID-19 related stress increased and decreased in accordance with the waxing and waning pattern of the pandemic, OCD symptoms showed an initial slight increase followed by a decrease at T<sub>3</sub> and again at T<sub>4</sub>. Changes in family members' accommodation of symptoms followed the same course as the OCD symptoms. Furthermore, OCD symptoms correlated with depressive symptoms, anxiety and stress levels and COVID-19 related distress at all timepoints.

"Mental Health Outcomes Associated with COVID-19 Pandemic in a Group of Health Care Professionals","Analysis of health care workers' stress levels during the COVID-19 virus pandemic, and whether there is a relationship between health care workers' stress levels and mental health in the context of coping with stress. One hundred and seventy professionally active health care workers took part in the study: doctors (n=41), nurses (n=114) and paramedics (n = 15). On average, study subjects were 37 years old and had 14 years of work experience. The following were used in this questionnaire-based study: General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Mini-COPE - Coping Inventory. The research group experienced high levels of stress. Nurses experienced the most acute stress. Increasing stress levels are accompanied by an intensification of psychopathological symptoms (insomnia and depression). Older individuals and those with more years worked at work experienced less psychopathological symptoms. Non-adaptive stress coping methods (e.g. use of psychoactive substances) resulted in deteriorating mental health within the research group. Habitual use of non-adaptive strategies may bring relief in the short term in the form of reduced negative consequences of stress transactions and facilitate mobilisation or just sufficient performance at work. However, in the longer term, it may lead to deteriorating health. The obtained data shows that positive reinterpretation, age and length of work track record constitute protective factors against deteriorating health.","Ziarko, Jasielska, StanisÃ…â€šawska-Kubiak, Daroszewski, Samborski, Mojs","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11414-021-09761-5","20210607","COVID-19; Health care professional; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14400,""

Hospitalization and severe illness when hospitalized (ie, combined outcome of intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, or death). Among 43Ã¢â‚¬Â¯465 patients with COVID-19 aged 18 years or younger, the median (interquartile range) age was 12 (4-16) years, 22Ã¢â‚¬Â¯943 (52.8%) were female patients, and 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯491 (28.7%) had underlying medical conditions. The most common diagnosed conditions were asthma (4416 [10.2%]), neurodevelopmental disorders (1690 [3.9%]), anxiety and fear-related disorders (1374 [3.2%]), depressive disorders (1209 [2.8%]), and obesity (1071 [2.5%]). The strongest risk factors for hospitalization were type 1 diabetes (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.60; 95% CI, 3.91-5.42) and obesity (aRR, 3.07; 95% CI, 2.66-3.54), and the strongest risk factors for severe COVID-19 illness were type 1 diabetes (aRR, 2.38; 95% CI, 2.06-2.76) and cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies (aRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.48-1.99). Prematurity was a risk factor for severe COVID-19 illness among children younger than 2 years (aRR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.47-2.29). Chronic and complex chronic disease were risk factors for hospitalization, with aRRs of 2.91 (95% CI, 2.63-3.23) and 7.86 (95% CI, 6.91-8.95), respectively, as well as for severe COVID-19 illness, with aRRs of 1.95 (95% CI, 1.69-2.26) and 2.86 (95% CI, 2.47-3.32), respectively. This cross-sectional study found a higher risk of severe COVID-19 illness among children with medical complexity and certain underlying conditions, such as type 1 diabetes, cardiac and circulatory congenital anomalies, and obesity. Health care practitioners could consider the potential need for close observation and cautious clinical management of children with these conditions and COVID-19.","Kompaniyets, Agathis, Nelson, Preston, Ko, Belay, Pennington, Danielson, DeSisto, Chevinsky, Schieber, Yusuf, Baggs, Mac Kenzie, Wong, Boehmer, Gundlapalli, Goodman","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11182","20210607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14401,""
"Use of video consultation in mental health departments in a hospital: a qualitative study of therapists' experiences of video consultations during the period of Covid-19 restrictions","As part of the political and professional development and increased focus on including service users within mental health services, services are being transformed: specifically, they are shifting from institutional to non-institutional care provision and increasingly integrating the use of e-health and digitalization. In the period from March to May 2020, Covid-19 restrictions forced rapid changes in the organization and provision of mental health services through the increased use of digital solutions in therapy. The aim of this paper is to develop and advance comprehensive knowledge about how therapists experience the use of VC. In order to reach this objective we draw on a study of therapists' experiences using video consultation (VC) in specialized mental health services in the early phase of the Covid-19 restrictions. The following questions were explored through interviews: Which opportunities and challenges appeared when using VC during the period of the Covid-19 restrictions? In a short-term care pathway, for whom does VC work and for whom does it not work? This study employed a qualitative approach, based on an abductive strategy and hermeneutic-phenomenological methodology. Therapists and managers in mental health departments in a hospital were interviewed via Skype for Business from March to May 2020, using a thematic interview guide that aimed to encourage reflections on the use of VC during Covid-19 restrictions. Therapists included in this study experienced advantages using VC in circumstances that did not permit face-to-face consultations. The continuity that video consultations offered the service users was seen as a valuable asset. Various negative aspects concerning the therapeutic environment, such as lack of safety for the most vulnerable service users and topics deemed unsuitable for VC, lowered the therapists' overall impression of the service. The themes that arose in the analysis of the data have been categorized in the following main topics: 1) VC-'it's better than nothing'; 2) VC affects therapists' work situation-opportunities and challenges in working conditions; 3) VC represents challenges when performing professional assessment and therapy on the screen. Experiences with video consultations in a mental health hospital during Covid-19 restrictions indicate that there are overall advantages to using VC when circumstances do not permit face-to-face consultations. Nevertheless, various negative aspects in the use of VC lowered the therapists' overall impression of VC. Further qualitative research is needed, and future studies should focus on service users' experiences, co-creation between different stakeholders and how to scale up the use of VC while ensuring that the service provided is appropriate, safe and available.","Knudsen Gullslett, Kristiansen, Nilsen","https://doi.org/10.2196/23150","20210607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14402,""
"Caring for Relatives with Dementia in Times of COVID-19: Impact on Caregivers and Care-recipients","<b>Objectives</b>: To analyze caregivers' perceived impact of the pandemic in their mental health and the well-being of the care-recipients.<b>Methods</b>: Caregivers (NÃ‚Â = 88) were asked if they had COVID-19 and about their perceptions of change of care-recipients' health conditions as well as whether their own mental health, conflicts with care-recipients and other relatives, thoughts of giving up caregiving, and feelings of coping well with the situation.<b>Results</b>: A large percentage of caregivers perceived a worsening of care-recipients' symptoms and of their own negative emotions, an increase in the number of conflicts and thoughts of needing to give up caregiving. Having had COVID-19 and reporting higher levels of distress as well as giving up caregiving were related to perceived worsening in care-recipients well-being. Perceived increases were mainly reported by younger caregivers, those who perceived to have not coped well, and those reporting an increase in conflicts. Some caregivers perceived an increase in positive emotions.<b>Conclusions</b>: The pandemic has a negative impact on caregivers' perceptions about the course of their own emotions and care-recipients' well-being.<b>Clinical implications</b>: Interventions are needed to train caregivers in strategies to cope with the sources of stress caused by the pandemic and to promote social support.","Losada, Vara-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Romero-Moreno, Barrera-Caballero, Pedroso-Chaparro, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Gonzalo, Fernandes-Pires, Cabrera, Gallego-Alberto, Huertas-Domingo, MÃƒÂ©rida-Herrera, OlazarÃƒÂ¡n-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, MÃƒÂ¡rquez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1928356","20210607","Caregivers; Covid-19; anxiety; dementia; depression; emotions; family; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14403,""

"Hidden Tales of Ebola: Airing the Forgotten Voices of Ugandan &quot;Ebola Nurses&quot;","According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ebola has affected the lives of thousands, including health care workers. With few studies describing the experience of nurses who survived Ebola, the study aimed to describe Ugandan nurses' experiences. Using a phenomenological design, in-depth interviews were conducted among five Ugandan nurses who contracted Ebola and survived. Thematic analysis revealed themes of expectations of dying, hopelessness, loneliness, and betrayal by family, community, and the health system. Results support the need for policies targeting holistic practice protocols to protect all health care professionals during future outbreaks. Last, nursing survivors should have access to government-guaranteed support programs, including free health care and financial stipends. These results and recommendations transcend to the current reality of living with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019).

"Comparing Mental Health of Athletes and Non-athletes as They Emerge From a COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown","Athletes going through transition periods such as injury or retirement have previously reported feelings of depression and anxiety, especially when feeling unsupported. Cessation of competitive sport during the pandemic has forced athletes through a non-normative transition and has reduced many opportunities to satisfy their basic psychological needs increasing the risk of poor wellbeing and loneliness. Whilst athletes are often praised for their resilience-a trait that serves to support them during tough times-the inability to play sport can be particularly challenging for those with strong athletic identities. An online cross-sectional survey (<i>n</i> = 744) was conducted to capture adult athlete and non-athlete mental health factors (specifically wellbeing, depression, anxiety, loneliness) during emergence from a COVID-19 lockdown. Results showed that resilience was positively correlated with mental health but was no higher in athletes than non-athletes. Furthermore, athletes reported greater anxiety than non-athletes, a difference mediated by negative affectivity-a subfactor of athletic identity. We present evidence that after a temporary transition away from sport, athletes' resilience is comparable to non-athletes leaving them just as likely to suffer poor mental health. Moreover, athletes with strong athletic identities are likely to experience anxiety symptoms above and beyond those reported by non-athletes. Findings have implications for the development of self-management guidance for athletes as the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions on sport participation continue.","Knowles, Shannon, Prentice, Breslin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2021.612532","20210607","anxiety; athlete; athletic identity; depression; loneliness; resilience; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14406,""

A 25-item questionnaire designed to assess the components of the objectives was tele-administered between October 2020 and January 2021 to the patients enrolled in the Indian Progressive Systemic Sclerosis Registry. Of the 428 patients in the registry, 336 took part in the study. A scheduled outpatient visit was missed by 310 (92.3%) patients, and 75 (22.3%) skipped prescription drugs. During the pandemic, 75 (22.3%) had a family member lose a job. Financial difficulties were reported by 155 (46.1%), with 116 (34.5%) patients having to spend an additional INR 4000 (2000-10 000) [USD 54.9 (27.0-137.4)] to continue treatment. Although 35 patients (10.4%) had at least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19, infection was confirmed in only 4. None of them needed hospitalization or had adverse outcomes. Worsening of scleroderma was seen in 133 (39.6%) individuals, with 15 (4.5%) requiring hospitalization. Most (96%) of the patients were aware of infection prevention measures, and 91 (27.1%) had taken unproven prophylactic medications. Individuals with scleroderma in India have been affected during the pandemic owing to closure of hospital services, lack of transport, loss of jobs and the additional financial burden.

"Yoga and Naturopathy intervention for reducing anxiety and depression of Covid-19 patients - A pilot study","Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) infection has caused a prominent psychological and mental havoc among the patients. Till now, there is paucity in literature for the management of psychological problems among patients with Covid-19. So we aimed in our study to assess the effect of Yoga and Naturopathy intervention on anxiety and depression of Covid-19 patients. This quasi experimental study was conducted among 130 Covid-19 positive patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital. Yoga and Naturopathic intervention was given for 60Ã‚Â min a day for two weeks. Hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS) and Corona anxiety scale (CAS) was used to assess the generalized anxiety and depression among the patients. Average age of the patients participated was 44 with the range from 36 to 53 years. Among them 85 were male and 45 were female. Of all 130 patients, 33% had symptoms of borderline depression, 9.2% had severe depression, 40% had borderline anxiety and 12.3% had severe anxiety. In CAS, 59 patients (45.38%) reported Covid-19 related dysfunctional anxiety. All the patients showed a significant reduction in the HADS- anxiety (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01), HADS-depression (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) and CAS (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.01) score after the intervention.

Our study aimed to investigate the efficacy, feasibility and safety of pulmonary rehabilitation in COVID-19 patients and to compare outcomes between patients with a mild/moderate and a severe/critical course of the disease. Patients in the post-acute phase of a mild to critical course of COVID-19 admitted to a comprehensive 3-week inpatient pulmonary rehabilitation programme were included in this prospective, observational cohort study. Several measures of exercise performance (6-min walk distance (6MWD)), lung function (forced vital capacity (FVC)) and quality of life (36-question short-form health survey (SF-36)) were assessed before and after pulmonary rehabilitation. 50 patients were included in the study (24 with mild/moderate and 26 with severe/critical COVID-19).

"Will Healthcare Workers Accept a COVID-19 Vaccine When It Becomes Available? A Cross-Sectional Study in China","<b>Objective:</b> The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is currently available. This timely survey was conducted to provide insight into on the willingness of healthcare workers (HCWs)to receive the vaccine and determine the influencing factors. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional online survey. An online questionnaire was provided to all participants and they were asked if they would accept a free vaccine. The questionnaire gathered general demographic information, and included the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12); Myers-Briggs Type Indicator questionnaire (MBTI); Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21); and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12). The data were collected automatically and electronically. Univariate analysis was done between all the variables and our dependent variable. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to examine and identify the associations between the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine with the associated variables. <b>Results:</b> We collected 505 complete answers.

"The Effect of COVID-19 and Related Lockdown Phases on Young Peoples' Worries and Emotions: Novel Data From India","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed unprecedented stress to young people. Despite recent speculative suggestions of poorer mental health in young people in India since the start of the pandemic, there have been no systematic efforts to measure these. Here we report on the content of worries of Indian adolescents and identify groups of young people who may be particularly vulnerable to negative emotions along with reporting on the impact of coronavirus on their lives. Three-hundred-and-ten young people from North India (51% male, 12-18 years) reported on their personal experiences of being infected by the coronavirus, the impact of the pandemic and its' restrictions across life domains, their top worries, social restrictions, and levels of negative affect and anhedonia. Findings showed that most participants had no personal experience (97.41%) or knew anyone (82.58%) with COVID-19, yet endorsed moderate-to-severe impact of COVID-19 on their academics, social life, and work. These impacts in turn associated with negative affect. Participants' top worries focused on academic attainments, social and recreational activities, and physical health. More females than males worried about academic attainment and physical health while more males worried about social and recreational activities. Thus, Indian adolescents report significant impact of the pandemic on various aspects of their life and are particularly worried about academic attainments, social and recreational activities and physical health.

"Rapid Evidence Assessment of Mental Health Outcomes of Pandemics for Health Care Workers: Implications for the Covid-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Little is known about the long-term mental health (MH) impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on health care workers (HCWs). However, synthesizing knowledge from past pandemics can help to anticipate this, along with identifying interventions required, when, and target populations most in need. This paper provides a balanced evaluation of what is currently known about short- and long-term MH impacts of pandemics on HCWs and effect of methodological limitations on knowledge claims. <b>Method:</b> A rapid evidence assessment (REA) was conducted on 41 studies published in the past two decades that examined MH outcomes for HCWs in relation to pandemics. <b>Results:</b> Findings of literary synthesis highlight common MH outcomes across pandemics, including increased stress, distress, burnout, and anxiety in the short-term, and post-traumatic stress and depression in the long-term. Findings also show the key role that organizations and public health bodies play in promoting adaptive coping and reducing health worries and the emotional and psychological distress caused by this. Evidence highlights particular groups at risk of developing MH issues (contact with patients that are infected, having children), and time points where risk may increase (initial response phase, when quarantined). However, inconsistencies in measures, analysis, and reporting all create limitations for pooling data. <b>Conclusions:</b> Findings can be used by researchers to provide a knowledge framework to inform future research that will assist HCWs in responding to pandemics, and by policy makers and service planners to provide an evidence-led brief about direction and evidence base for related policy initiatives, interventions or service programmes.","Waring, Giles","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.629236","20210607","COVID-19; health care workers; mental health outcomes; pandemic; rapid evidence assessment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14414,""

Among them, 382 are medical students. Among the participants, 12.26, 18.47, and 8.53% have moderate to severe levels of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, respectively. Compared with the non-medical students, the medical students had a higher knowledge level of COVID-19, a higher sense of awareness, and fewer mental health symptoms. After controlling the covariance, perceived constraints of sense of control were negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress among both medical and non-medical students. Prevention of negative emotions by mindful coping was negatively associated with depression and anxiety among non-medical students. Knowledge of COVID-19 is not associated with mental distress among medical and non-medical students. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic in China, the mental health of University students was affected. Our findings suggested that a sense of control is a protective factor for both medical and non-medical students, while mindful coping is a protective factor for only non-medical students.","Xiong, Ming, Zhang, Bai, Luo, Cao, Zhang, Tao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.603331","20210607","anxiety; depression; pandemic of COVID-19; stress; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14415,""
"Higher education students' behaviour and mental health during Covid-19 lockdown: a pilot study","The flare-up of Covid-19 in India caused open turmoil and pressure on emotional wellbeing among university students. At first, it was about course finishing; later, the issues moved to assessment. This scourge increases mental issues, stress, dissatisfaction, sorrow, and nervousness. The aim of this study was to assess the mental health and behaviour of Mizoram University students during the Covid-19 lockdown period. This study was a cross-sectional investigation, and a snowball method sampling technique was utilised for obtainging information from the students. There were 65.2% of students who revealed that they were giving more consideration to their emotional wellbeing during this pandemic. More than half of the participants (67.2%) reported no expanded worry of stress from scholastic work, and 65.2% reported that they were paying more attention to their emotional wellbeing and mental health following the pandemic. Further, 69.7% reported that they were spending more time exercising. Nearly 55% of students took part in Zoom classes, with a length of 35 to 40Ã‚Â min. About 65.7% of students gained proficiency in their course by means of a learning management system. Students performed activities at home during the lockdown period, watching TV (75.4%), reading books (38.7%), and on writing assignments (34.8%); and 34.5% of the students viewed news from TV, newspapers, and social media about the Covid-19 pandemic each day. The positive effects on psychological wellbeing may have helped the students adapt to other negative effects and expanded pressure on emotional wellbeing. This pandemic impact will probably be engraved on every individual surveyed.","Mishra, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01591-1","20210607","Academics; Covid-19 pandemic; Lifestyle; Mental health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14416,""
"Lessons from COVID-19-free Vanuatu: intensive health operations for Phase 1 of repatriation and quarantine, May-July 2020","International borders to Vanuatu closed on 23Ã‚Â March 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. In May-July 2020, the Government of Vanuatu focused on the safe and timely return of citizens and residents while ensuring Vanuatu remained COVID-19 free. Under Phase 1 of repatriation, between 27Ã‚Â May and 23Ã‚Â June 2020, 1522 people arrived in the capital, Port Vila, and were placed in compulsory government-mandated 14-day quarantine in 15 hotels. Pre-arrival health operations included collection of repatriate information, quarantine facility assessments, training for personnel supporting the process, and tabletop and functional exercises with live scenario simulations. During quarantine, health monitoring, mental health assessments and psychosocial support were provided. All repatriates completed 14 days of quarantine. One person developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19 during quarantine but tested negative. Overall health operations were considered a success despite logistical and resource challenges. Lessons learnt were documented during a health sector after-action review held on 22Ã‚Â July 2020. Key recommendations for improvement were to obtain timely receipt of repatriate information before travel, limit the number of repatriates received and avoid the mixing of &quot;travel cohorts,&quot; ensure sufficient human resources are available to support operations while maintaining other essential services, establish a command and control structure for health operations, develop training packages and deliver them to all personnel supporting operations, and coordinate better with other sectors to ensure health aspects are considered. These recommendations were applied to further improve health operations for subsequent repatriation and quarantine, with Phase 2 commencing on 1Ã‚Â August 2020.","Tapo, Knox, van Gemert-Doyle, Manwo, Iavro, Williams, Maurice, Harrison, Cornish, Benjamin, Atua, Obed, Clark, Guyant, Leodoro, Tarivonda","https://doi.org/10.5365/wpsar.2020.11.4.004","20210607","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14417,""
"The Indirect Effect of Parental Intolerance of Uncertainty on Perinatal Mental Health via Mindfulness During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mental health difficulties, especially during pregnancy and early postpartum. Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and reduced capacity for mindfulness-a protective factor for child-bearers-may be particularly relevant factors driving mental health problems given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. The current study aims to shed light on modifiable paths to perinatal psychological distress by testing whether there is an indirect effect of IU on psychological symptoms through a perceived reduction in mindfulness during the pandemic. Pregnant individuals (67%, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°133) and new mothers within 6Ã‚Â months postpartum (33%, <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°66) participated in a cross-sectional online survey assessing IU, current and retrospective pre-pandemic mindfulness (FFMQ), and psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, somatization; BSI). Perceived change in mindfulness was captured by including retrospective mindfulness as a covariate in the PROCESS macro used for analyses. Tests of the direct association between mindfulness, IU, and psychological symptoms showed significant effects of IU (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.46, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.064; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and perceived decrease in mindfulness during the pandemic (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.72, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) on psychological symptoms (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.21-.34; <i>F</i>[2, 197]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51.13-52.81, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The indirect effect of IU on symptoms via perceived decrease in mindfulness during the pandemic (<i>b</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.13, <i>SE</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.043, 95%CI [.060, .226]) was significant (<i>R</i><sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.41, <i>F</i>[3, 195]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45.08, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Results suggest that mothers who are less able to tolerate uncertainty experience more psychological symptoms, in part due to perceived reduction in mindfulness during the pandemic. Future research should examine whether IU is a screening risk marker and target for mindfulness-based interventions to improve maternal well-being and family outcomes.","Sbrilli, Haigler, Laurent","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-021-01657-x","20210607","COVID-19; Intolerance of uncertainty; Mediation; Mindfulness; Perinatal; Psychological symptoms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14418,""
"COVID-19 mRNA Vaccines Are Generally Safe in the Short Term: A Vaccine Vigilance Real-World Study Says","The prophylactic vaccination of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines is the first large-scale application of this kind in the human world. Over 1.8 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in the US until December 2020, and around 0.2% submitted AE reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). This study aimed to evaluate the AEs following immunization (AEFIs) and analyze the potential associations based on the information from the VAERS database. We searched the VAERS database recorded AEFIs after COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. After data mapping, we summarized demographic and clinical features of reported cases. Fisher exact test was used to comparing the clinical characteristics among AE groups with an anaphylactic response, concerning neurological disorders andÃ‚Â death. VAERS reported 3,908 AEFIs of COVID-19 vaccines in December 2020. Most (79.68%) were reported after the first dose of the vaccine. Among the reported cases, we found that general disorders (48.80%), nervous system disorders (46.39%), and gastrointestinal disorders (25.54%) were the most common AEFIs. The allergy history was more frequent in vaccine recipients with anaphylactic reactions than those without (64.91% <i>vs.</i> 49.62%, OR = 1.88, <i>P &lt;0.017</i>). History of anxiety or depression was more common in subjects reporting severe neurological AEFIs than those reporting other AEFIs (18.37% <i>vs.</i> 7.85%, OR = 2.64, <i>P &lt;0.017</i>). Cases reporting death were significantly older (79.36 Ã‚Â± 10.41-year-old <i>vs.</i> 42.64 Ã‚Â± 12.55-year-old, <i>P &lt;0.01</i>, 95% CI 29.30-44.15) and more likely experienced hypertension (50.00% <i>vs.</i> 11.42%, OR = 7.76, <i>P &lt;0.01</i>) and neurological disorders (50.00% <i>vs.</i> 5.36%, OR = 17.65, <i>P &lt;0.01</i>) than other vaccine recipients. The outpatient and emergency room visit rates were 11.92 and 22.42% for AEFIs, and 2.53% of cases needed hospitalization. AEFIs of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines were generally non-severe local or systemic reactions. A prior allergy history is the risk factor for anaphylaxis, while a history of anxiety may link with severe neurological AEs. Such vaccine recipients need further evaluation and monitor.","Chen, Li, Sun, Zhou, Yin, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.669010","20210607","COVID-19; adverse event; mRNA; safety issue; vaccine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14419,""
"Forced Social Isolation and Mental Health: A Study on 1,006 Italians Under COVID-19 Lockdown","Most countries have been struggling with the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic imposing social isolation on their citizens. However, this measure carried risks for people's mental health. This study evaluated the psychological repercussions of objective isolation in 1,006 Italians during the first, especially strict, lockdown in spring 2020. Although varying for the regional spread-rate of the contagion, results showed that the longer the isolation and the less adequate the physical space where people were isolated, the worse the mental health (e.g., depression). Offline social contacts buffered the association between social isolation and mental health. However, when offline contacts were limited, online contacts seemed crucial in protecting mental health. The findings inform about the potential downsides of the massive social isolation imposed by COVID-19 spread, highlighting possible risk factors and resources to account for implementing such isolation measures. Specifically, besides some known factors such as physical space availability, the local contagion rate is critical in moderating the link between social isolation and mental health issues, supporting national policies implementing regional tiers of restriction severity.","Pancani, Marinucci, Aureli, Riva","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.663799","20210607","COVID-19; mental health; offline contacts; online contacts; social isolation; space adequacy; virus local spread","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14420,""
"Death Concerns, Benefit-Finding, and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, reminders of death are particularly salient. Although much terror management theory research demonstrates that people engage in defensive tactics to manage mortality awareness, other work shows that existential concerns can motivate growth-oriented actions to improve health. The present study explored the associative link between coronavirus anxieties, fear of death, and participants' well-being. Results, using structural equation modeling, found that increased mortality concerns stemming from COVID-19 were associated with heightened benefit finding (e.g., relationship investment, gratefulness, patience) from the pandemic. Increased benefit finding, in turn, was related to higher life satisfaction, meaning in life, self-esteem, resilience, and vitality while also correlating negatively with depression and stress scores. There was no evidence for reverse mediation in that fear of mortality did not predict well-being through coronavirus worries. Overall, although many persons have experienced mental health concerns (e.g., fear, stress) as a function of the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings demonstrate positive benefits that paradoxically follow in terms of an increased appreciation of life, improved relationships, and better health.","Cox, Swets, Gully, Xiao, Yraguen","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.648609","20210607","COVID-19; benefit-finding; coronavirus; death; existential anxieties; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14421,""
"How Having a Clear Why Can Help Us Cope With Almost Anything: Meaningful Well-Being and the COVID-19 Pandemic in MÃƒÂ©xico","<b>Background:</b> Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in an increase in known risk factors for mental health problems. Mexico adopted lockdown and physical distancing as a containment strategy with potential consequences on day to day life, such as social isolation, loss of income and loneliness that can have important consequences in terms of mental health. <b>Objective:</b> We aimed to examine the effect of the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic on psychological distress, well-being and perceived physical health among Mexican-base respondents and to examine whether coping strategies would play a potential intermediating role in relation to these variables. Under the Existential Positive Psychology perspective, an emphasis was made on meaning-centered coping. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 30 and June 16th 2020 among 604 Mexicans-base respondents of which 471 were women and 132 men. Data was collected by using online questionnaires. Psychological distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). The Brief COPE Inventory was used to assess problem-focused and emotion-focused coping strategies. We also used the Meaning-Centered Coping Scale (MCCS). PERMA-Profiler was used to assess well-being, perceived physical health, and loneliness. Profiler and Descriptive analyses and bivariate linear regression were performed to examine the association of variables. <b>Results:</b> 45.9% of the participants reported moderate to extremely severe psychological distress. Our results demonstrate that problem-focused and emotion-focused coping were positively related to psychological distress, whereas meaning-centered coping was negatively associated with distress. Furthermore, psychological distress played a potential negative role in the perceived physical health, while meaning-centered coping and well-being buffered the negative influence of psychological distress on perceived physical health (completely standardized indirect effect = -0.01, SE: 0.012, 95% CI [-0.065; -0.017]. <b>Conclusion:</b> Meaning-centered coping was found to suppress the negative influence of psychological distress on sensation of decreased physical health corroborating the critical role of meaning in life in promoting well-being. Future studies can further examine the value of the critical role of meaning in life in promoting well-being as a protective factor against severe distress during traumatic events.

"Music Listening in Times of COVID-19 Outbreak: A Brazilian Study","The COVID-19 outbreak required diverse strategies, such as social distancing and self-isolation, to avoid a healthcare system crisis. However, these measures have been associated with the onset or increase of anxiety and depression symptoms in the population. Music listening was previously shown to regulate emotion, consequently reducing depression symptoms. Since previous studies with Brazilian samples have already shown a high prevalence of depressive symptoms during the first confinement period, the aim of this study was threefold: (i) to compare groups with severe depression symptoms and no depression in what concerns to demographic and socio-economic factors as well as symptoms of anxiety and resilience levels, (ii) to explore changes in music listening daily routine during the confinement measures by both groups (no depression and severe depression), and (iii) to investigate which were the main factors influencing both two groups to music listening during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study included 494 Brazilian respondents aged 18 years and above. Our online survey comprised demographics, socio-economic, and COVID-19 related questionnaires, with questions regarding music listening used during social distancing measures on which the participants rated how much each of the 41 potential reasons for listening to music changed in importance compared to the situation before the pandemic and also the evaluation of anxiety, depression, and resilience levels. The respondents with severe depression were younger and showed higher levels of anxiety symptoms and lower resilience level. Furthermore, they were increasingly likely to listen to music to feel emotionally better with the situation, to feel comfort, to forget problems, to be energetic, to decrease sad feelings, to relax, to cheer up, to forget concerns, to express feelings, to reduce anxiety, to remember better times, to relieve boredom, to mentally stimulate themselves, and to ward off stressful thoughts compared to the participants with no depression. The exploratory factor analysis (FA) identified four types of music listening functions during social distancing measures: negative mood management, cognitive functioning, positive mood management, and physical involvement, in which the participants with severe depression revealed significant differences compared to non-depressed participants for the negative mood management factor, which shows the importance of music listening to regulate their negative emotions. As a conclusion, we can argue that most of our respondents used music listening to cope with and regulate their moods during confinement, especially those who presented with severe depression symptoms.","Ribeiro, Lessa, Delmolin, Santos","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647473","20210607","Brazil; COVID-19; depression; music listening; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14423,""
"Home Confinement in Previously Active Older Adults: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Physical Fitness and Physical Activity Behavior and Their Relationship With Depressive Symptoms","The aim of our study was to analyze physical activity levels, sitting time, physical fitness, and their relationship with depressive symptoms after home confinement in previously active older adults. This cross-sectional study sample comprised 68 older adults (74.24 Ã‚Â± 5.67 years) from a community-based exercise program conducted in Porto, Portugal. After home confinement, participants were assessed in person for lower-body strength (30-s chair stand test), cardiorespiratory fitness (6-min walking test), agility/dynamic balance (8-ft up-and-go test), handgrip strength, and anthropometry. Telephone interviews were performed to evaluate depressive symptoms with the Geriatric Depression Scale - 15 items (GDS-15) and physical activity levels through the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SV). Individuals were also asked to self-report changes in their physical activity levels and time spent sitting. Ninety percent of older adults self-reported a decrease in overall physical activity levels, and nearly 65% increased daily sitting time during the home confinement. However, previously active older adults still presented high levels of physical fitness (scores above 50th compared with Portuguese normative values) after 11 weeks of home confinement. Overall, 52.9% of participants scored 5 or more points on GDS-15, which is suggestive of depression. Higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and cardiorespiratory fitness were found in the non-depressed group compared with the depressed group. Finally, results from multiple regression analysis revealed that MVPA was negatively associated with depression. This model explained 16.4% of the variability seen in depression score, controlled for age, gender, and education. Even reporting a decline in physical activity, older adults who previously participated in a formal exercise program, still presented high levels of physical fitness after 11 weeks of home confinement. However, MVPA, but not physical fitness, seems to be an associated depression score in previously active older adults. These results reinforce the importance of older adults to remain physically active, since higher levels of MVPA may have a protective effect on depressive symptoms and, therefore, mitigate the negative impact of home confinement on mental health. Future longitudinal research studies are needed to ascertain these results.","Carvalho, Borges-Machado, Pizarro, Bohn, Barros","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.643832","20210607","COVID-19; depression; exercise; mental health; multicomponent training","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14424,""
"Mental Health Consequences of Adversity in Australia: National Bushfires Associated With Increased Depressive Symptoms, While COVID-19 Pandemic Associated With Increased Symptoms of Anxiety","High quality monitoring of mental health and well-being over an extended period is essential to understand how communities respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and how to best tailor interventions. Multiple community threats may also have cumulative impact on mental health, so examination across several contexts is important. The objective of this study is to report on changes in mental health and well-being in response to the Australian bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic. This study utilized an Experience-Sampling-Method (ESM), using the smartphone-based mood monitoring application, MoodPrism. Participants were prompted once a day to complete a brief survey inquiring about symptoms of depression and anxiety, and several well-being indices, including arousal, emotional valence, self-esteem, motivation, social connectedness, meaning and purpose, and control. Participants were <i>N</i> = 755 Australians (aged 13 years and above) who downloaded and used MoodPrism, between 2018 and 2020. Results showed that anxiety symptoms significantly increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, but not during the bushfires. This may be explained by concurrent feelings of social connectedness maintained during the bushfires but not during the pandemic. In contrast, depressive symptoms increased significantly during the bushfires, which maintained during the pandemic. Most indices of well-being decreased significantly during the bushfires, and further again during the pandemic. Study findings highlight the unique responses to the bushfire and COVID-19 crises, revealing specific areas of resilience and vulnerability.

"Development of a Salutogenesis Workshop for SPPs to Help Them, Their Athletes, and the Athlete's Entourage Better Cope With Uncertainty During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic is also called a crisis of uncertainty because of so many unforeseeable events like canceled qualification competitions, loss of training facilities, and postponement of the Olympic games. Athletes and their entourage experience this uncertainty as stressful. Sport psychology practitioners (SPPs) are in a key position to support athletes in coping with these unforeseeable stressors. However, SPPs are similarly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and simultaneously have to cope with stress. Salutogenesis, which describes how to manage stress and to stay well, provides a theoretical approach to how to cope with uncertainty. The salutogenetic approach aims at strengthening individuals' sense of coherence (SoC) and consists of three components, namely comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness. Although it is known that the SoC can be enhanced <i>via</i> psychological skills training, so far, this approach has not been systematically applied to the elite sport context. Athletes have been advised to see SPPs for help; thus, the question of how SPPs handle the time of uncertainty while supporting others emerges. The aim of this contribution was to outline how the salutogenetic approach can be applied to strengthening SPPs' SoC <i>via</i> a single-day four-part workshop. Additionally, we applied the workshop to <i>N</i> = 26 volleyball coaches and evaluated the workshop's effects on participants' psychological aspects [i.e., the Sense of Coherence-Leipziger short version (SoC-L9), resilience (RS-13): coping with uncertainty, affective response, and stress <i>via</i> semantic differentials] and the workshop's quality ratings (i.e., Quality Questionnaire for Sport Psychological Coaching, QS-17). The evaluation provides results that show a positive impact on a descriptive level of the participants' SoC, uncertainty, affect, and stress perception; however, the results show no significant main effect of time [<i>F</i>(8, 10) = 1.04, <i>p</i> = 0.467, ÃŽÂ· <sub> <i>p</i> </sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.454]. Workshop quality (on average, 3.60 Ã‚Â± 0.35 out of 4.00) and skill acquisition (on average, 3.00 Ã‚Â± 0.64 out of 4.00) were positively evaluated; 82.00% of the participants would use the learned tools in the future. Thus, we outline how this workshop might help strengthen SPPs' SoC and at the same time empower them to strengthen their athletes' SoC. Overall, we add a theoretical (i.e., salutogenesis in sports) and a practical perspective (i.e., coping techniques based on salutogenesis) on how to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic for SPPS, athletes, and their support network.","Leisterer, Lautenbach, Walter, Kronenberg, Elbe","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.612264","20210607","mental health; psychological counseling; resilience; staff; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14426,""
"Impact of Sleep Deprivation on Emotional Regulation and the Immune System of Healthcare Workers as a Risk Factor for COVID 19: Practical Recommendations From a Task Force of the Latin American Association of Sleep Psychology","Healthcare workers who are on the front line of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and are also undergoing shift schedules face long work hours with few pauses, experience desynchronization of their circadian rhythm, and an imbalance between work hours effort and reward in saving lives, resulting in an impact on work capacity, aggravated by the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE), few resources and precarious infrastructure, and fear of contracting the virus and contaminating family members. Some consequences are sleep deprivation, chronic insomnia, stress-related sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. These sleep alterations critically affect mental health, precipitating or perpetuating anxiety, stress, and depression, resulting in the inability to regulate positive and negative emotions. Pre-existing sleep disorders are an important risk factor for the development and maintenance of PSTD when individuals are exposed to an important stressor such as a COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, how an individual regulates the emotion associated with worries during daytime functioning impacts nighttime sleep, precipitating and perpetuating difficulties in sleeping. All of these changes in sleep and emotional regulation also alter the immune system. Sleep deprivation is commonly associated with chronic inflammatory diseases, due to the desynchronizations in circadian rhythms, causing possible psychophysiological disorders and impaired neuroimmune-endocrine homeostasis. From this perspective, we clarify in this article how sleep disorders affect the immune system and emotional regulation, explaining their phenomenological and neurobiological mechanisms, and discussing elements of cognitive and behavioral coping for health professionals to adopt and manage a healthier sleep pattern in the COVID-19 outbreak.","de Almondes, MarÃƒÂ­n Agudelo, JimÃƒÂ©nez-Correa","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.564227","20210607","cognitive behavioral therapy; emotional regulation; health professionals; immune system; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14427,""

"Prevalence of Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms and Its Associations With Quality of Life, Demographic and Clinical Characteristics in COVID-19 Survivors During the Post-COVID-19 Era","<b>Background:</b> The prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) in COVID-19 survivors is unclear. This study examined the prevalence of PTSS and its association with quality of life (QOL) among COVID-19 survivors during the post-COVID-19 era in China. <b>Methods:</b> This was a comparative, cross-sectional study. PTSS, depressive symptoms, and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. <b>Results:</b> A total of 134 COVID-19 survivors and 214 non-infected controls (healthy controls hereafter) were recruited. Among COVID-19 survivors, the PTSS prevalence was 18.66% (95%CI: 11.98-25.34%), which was significantly higher than that (5.61%, 95%CI: 2.50-8.71%) of healthy controls (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001).

"Coping Strategies and Psychopathological Responses Among Medical and Non-medical Professionals - a Cross-Sectional Online Survey","<b>Background:</b> The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic was announced on March 11th, 2020, due to a surge of newly confirmed cases that significantly impacted populations worldwide, both directly and indirectly. Based on past epidemics research, the mental health implications of introduced restrictions should be expected and adequately addressed irrespective of the practiced profession. <b>Objective:</b> The study aimed to explore psychopathological responses, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), concerning coping strategy clusters during the COVID-19 pandemic among medical and non-medical workers. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional web survey of the general population of internet users was performed from March 16th to April 26th, 2020, in Poland during the first peak of COVID-19 cases. A sample of 1,831 professionally active respondents, 64.0% of which pursuing a medical career, filled out General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), and MiniCOPE, along with the socio-demographic questionnaire exploring personal as well as the work-related possibility of direct exposure to contagion and availability of proper protection, contact with the infected without accurate protective measures as well as the adequacy of workers when compared settings. <b>Results:</b> Individuals labeled with specific clusters had significantly different psychopathological manifestations. Irrespective of performed job maladaptive cluster was associated with significantly higher GHQ-28 and IES-R scores on total subscales and all subscales compared to those representing the non-specific and adaptive cluster. Similar findings were observed concerning the frequency of the GHQ-28 positive score. Moreover, the non-specific cluster was associated with significantly higher GHQ-28 total scores among medical professionals. However, GHQ-28 positive scores were significantly more frequent in medical workers using adaptive clusters when compared to non-specific. Such relations were not observed in the non-medical group. IES-R total and subscales' scores did not significantly vary within medical and non-medical groups when adaptive and non-specific clusters were compared. Pursuing a non-medical career was found to be a determinant of lower scores, while female sex was observed to be determinant of higher scores in both GHQ-28 and IES-R scales. <b>Conclusions:</b> Positive screening for psychopathological and PTSD symptoms was expected regardless of the analyzed groups' coping strategies. Given the dramatically developing situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, support initiatives grounded in research evidence may be essential for maintaining the mental well-being and resilience of both the medical and non-medical workforce.","CiuÃ…â€škowicz, Maciaszek, Misiak, PaÃ…â€šÃˆÂ©ga, Rymaszewska, SzczeÃ…â€ºniak","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.663224","20210607","COVID-19; PTSD; coping strategies; healthcare workers; mental health; pandemic; psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14431,""
"Mental Health and Psychosocial Support During COVID-19: A Review of Health Guidelines in Sub-Saharan Africa","The COVID-19 pandemic brought in its wake an unforeseen mental health crisis. The World Health Organization published a guideline as a way of supporting mental health and psychosocial well-being of different groups during this pandemic. The impact of the pandemic has pushed governments to put measures in place to curb not only the physical health of individuals but their mental health and psychosocial well-being as well. The aim of our paper was to review mental health guidelines of some Sub Saharan African (SSA) countries: (i) to assess their appropriateness for the immediate mental health needs at this time, (ii) to form as a basis for ongoing reflection as the current pandemic evolves. Guidelines were retrieved openly from internet search and some were requested from mental health practitioners in various SSA countries. The authors designed a semi structured questionnaire, as a self-interview guide to gain insight on the experience of COVID-19 from experts in the mental health sector in the various countries. While we used a document analysis approach to analyze the data, we made use of the Mental Health Preparedness and Action Framework to discuss our findings. We received health or mental health guidelines from 10 SSA countries. Cameroon, Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, and Uganda all had mental health guidelines or mental health component in their health guidelines. Our experts highlight that the mental health needs of the people are of concern during this pandemic but have not been given priority. They go further to suggest that the mental health needs are slightly different during this time and requiring a different approach especially considering the measures taken to curb the spread of disease. We conclude that despite the provision of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support guidelines, gaps still exist making them inadequate to meet the mental health needs of their communities.","Molebatsi, Musindo, Ntlantsana, Wambua","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.571342","20210607","COVID-19; Sub-Saharan Africa; mental health guidelines; mental health service; prevention policies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14432,""
"Is Higher Subjective Fear Predictive of Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms in a Sample of the Chinese General Public?","<b>Background:</b> COVID-19 has taken a huge toll on medical resources and the economy and will inevitably have an impact on public mental health. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as the most common mental illness after an epidemic, must be seriously addressed. This study aimed to investigate the subjective fear of the Chinese general public during COVID-19 and to explore how it affected the development of PTSD. <b>Methods:</b> An online questionnaire survey was conducted among 1,009 people from January 30 to February 14, 2020 (about 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak). The subjective fear was measured by a self-reported single-choice question. Four items from the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were selected to measure the subjects' sleep quality. Their post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) were measured by the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). Pearson correlation, hierarchical multivariate regression analysis, multiple mediator model, and bootstrapping were used in statistical analyses. <b>Results:</b> Different people showed different levels of subjective fear in response to the outbreak. There was a significant positive correlation between subjective fear and the total score of PCL-5 (<i>R</i> = 0.513, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.01), meaning that the higher the degree of subjective fear, the more severe the symptoms of post-traumatic stress are. Subjective fear was an important predictor of PTSS, accounting for 24.3% of the variance. The total effect of subjective fear on PCL-5 scores was significant (total effect = 7.426, <i>SE</i> = 0.405, 95% CI = 6.631-8.221). The total indirect effect of subjective fear on PCL-5 scores through sleep quality was also significant (total indirect effect = 1.945, <i>SE</i> = 0.258, 95% CI = 1.436-2.470). <b>Conclusions:</b> Subjective fear has an important predictive effect on PTSS. In addition to the direct effect, our findings firstly demonstrate the mediating role of sleep quality in the relationship between subjective fear and PTSS.","Guo, Liu, Xing, Wang, Shang, Sun, Jia, Wu, Ni, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.560602","20210607","COVID-19; general public health; post-traumatic stress symptoms; sleep quality; subjective fear","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14433,""
"Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Initially, COVID-19 is a disease that attacks the respiratory tract, but now the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are various, including acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Emergency surgeries such as mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for AIS must be performed without any delay even during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce morbidity and mortality. Besides the focus on patient's health, the safety of healthcare workers must also be considered. The aim of the study was to evaluate and summarize the scientific literature systematically to explore MT for AIS in the COVID-19 pandemic. The independent reviewers searched the literature through 12 electronic databases, searching for articles fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data from all included studies were presented in a summary table featuring key points of each study. The authors independently assessed the risk of bias of 15 included articles. Although MT procedure has been prolonged during the pandemic, clinical outcomes and procedure-related serious adverse events have remained unchanged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The screening process and the implementation of the PCS algorithm must be performed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 infection without threatening patient safety and clinical outcomes. The standard precaution of infection and the health assurance of healthcare workers and their families (including mental health) are also important factors that must be given special attention and consideration in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kurnianto, Tugasworo, Andhitara, Retnaningsih, Ardhini, Budiman","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41983-021-00321-4","20210607","Acute ischemic stroke; COVID-19; Ischemic stroke; Mechanical thrombectomy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14434,""
"Prevalence and psychosocial risk factors of nonsuicidal self-injury among adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak","The research investigated the prevalence of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) during the COVID-19 outbreak and identified the psychosocial risk factors among junior high school students in Taiwan. Cross-sectional design was applied and 1,060 participants (Mage = 14.66, SD = 0.86 years) were recruited into the study. The prevalence of NSSI was found to be 40.9% (95% confidence interval, 37.9%-43.9%) during the COVID-19 outbreak. The results suggested that the self-injurers group were mostly female, and scored significantly higher in neuroticism, depression, impulsivity, alexithymia, virtual social support, dissatisfaction with academic performance, and lower in subjective wellbeing, self-esteem, actual social support, and family function than the non-injurers group. In addition, high neuroticism, low self-esteem, high virtual social support, high impulsivity, and high alexithymia were independently predictive in the logistic regression analysis. The principal results of this study suggested that NSSI was extremely prevalent among adolescents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and in particularly, personality and virtual environment risk factors and enhancing self-esteem should be the focus of NSSI preventive strategies when targeting this age population. Our results provide a reference towards designing NSSI prevention programs geared toward the high school population during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Tang, Lin, You, Wu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01931-0","20210607","COVID-19; Nonsuicidal self-injury; Prevalence; Risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14435,""
"Stay at home! When personality profiles influence mental health and creativity during the COVID-19 lockdown","With the COVID-19 outbreak, the population was suddenly forced to &quot;stay at home&quot;. Although research suggests that social isolation affects health and wellbeing, reactions may vary depending on individuals. The current study assessed the relationships between personality variables (preference for solitude and Big Five personality), mental health (anxiety, stress, loneliness), and creativity, and tried to determine whether the identified personality profiles affect individuals' mental health and creativity. French respondents (<i>N</i>Ã‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°430) filled in an online questionnaire during the first lockdown in Spring 2020. The results showed that the preference for solitude and personality variables of the Big Five predicted individuals' mental health and creativity. Moreover, a cluster analysis revealed three profiles of individuals: &quot;Affiliation&quot;, &quot;Emotionally Stable Lonely&quot; and &quot;Emotionally Unstable Lonely&quot;. Results showed that individuals with &quot;Affiliation&quot; and &quot;Emotionally Unstable Lonely&quot; profiles expressed higher stress and anxiety, and the latter performed better on a divergent creative thinking task. By contrast, those with an &quot;Emotionally Stable Lonely&quot; profile expressed a lower level of loneliness, and performed better on a creative insight task. These findings reveal the importance of personality profiles in psychological reactions during lockdowns. With this knowledge, health professionals could develop appropriate interventions to accompany high-risk individuals in situations of social isolation.

"Can Personality Traits Predict Depression during the COVID-19 Pandemic?","The emotional costs of the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns among clinicians and scholars. The goal of the current study was to test whether or not neuroticism, conscientiousness, and personal belief in a just world are associated with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the contribution of neuroticism and conscientiousness was assessed over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions, and the unique contribution of personal belief in a just world was evaluated beyond all the other study variables. Samples were collected in three different countries-Israel (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°917), Germany (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°213), and India (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°160). Online self-report questionnaires were utilized to measure age, gender, COVID-19 perceptions (probability, severity, and self-efficacy), neuroticism, conscientiousness, personal belief in a just world, and depression. The findings indicated that, across the three countries, neuroticism was positively associated with depression (correlations ranging from .24 to .44), and conscientiousness and personal belief in a just world were negatively associated with depression (correlations ranging from -Ã¢â‚¬â€°.31 to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°.21, and from -Ã¢â‚¬â€°.35 to -Ã¢â‚¬â€°.23, respectively). Moreover, neuroticism and conscientiousness explained unique variance over and above demographic variables and COVID-19 perceptions (except conscientiousness in India), and the effect of personal belief in a just world on depression was significant beyond the effects of all other study variables. These findings support the role of personality in explaining depression regardless of situational characteristics and stress the role of just world beliefs as protective factors against negative emotions.","Nudelman, Kamble, Otto","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11211-021-00369-w","20210607","Belief in a just world; COVID-19; Conscientiousness; Depression; Neuroticism","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14437,""
"[Experiences of families of autistic children during a period of lockdown: Exploratory study]","The lockdown periods associated with the Covid-19 pandemic are a particularly significant challenge for families of children with autism. Exchanges by e-mail and interviews were aimed at collecting testimonies from parents for a better understanding of their difficulties and the help provided by the mobilization of professionals. Eight parents of autistic children living in the Seine-Saint-Denis area agreed to testify about their experience, either in person, taking into account the barrier measures after the first lockdown, or by telephone during the second lockdown. By way of comparison, e-mails were exchanged with a mother and two fathers of autistic children from higher socio-economic backgrounds living in other parts of France or Belgium. While at the beginning of the first lockdown, some children may have felt soothed by being at home with their parents, the extension of the situation led to crises related to feelings of anxiety or boredom. Despite the closure of many medical-social facilities, professionals mobilized to continue helping families and children whose routines were disrupted. Depending on the conditions of lockdown, the families' experiences differed and evolved over time. The major problems encountered by some families were the worsening of their child's troubles (self-harm, tantrums, violence, and shouting). Pedagogical tools were adapted by the teachers, activity sheets were sent out, group workshops were organized, and consultations were given at a distance. The teams of the child psychiatry services and the medico-social services have mobilized themselves and have shown reactivity and inventiveness in order to ensure the care and follow-up of children and their families.","Chamak","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2021.05.003","20210607","Autism; Child psychiatry services; Covid-19 pandemic; FamiliesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ experiences; Lockdown; Medico-social services; Seine-Saint-Denis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14438,""
"[Feedback from the establishment of a psychiatric regulation line at SAMU 62 in the context of Covid-19]","The epidemic context of Covid-19 and the containment measures, put in place since 16Ã‚Â March 2020, has significantly increased the number of emergencies calls in call center (SAMU). In the department of Pas-de-Calais, one step of the crisis measures was setting up a psychiatric regulation line, which aims to manage calls with strong emotional valence (in connexion with containment, anxiety related to the epidemic context, or break in psychiatric cares for people suffering of mental disorders). This psychiatric hotline was provided from 20 March 2020 to 15 May 2020 by fifteen psychiatric careers (psychiatrists, psychologists and psychiatric nurses) from the network of the medical-psychological emergency unit (unit of the emergency call center which aims to manage people involved in psychotraumatic events). In total, 556 calls were answered, i.e. an average of 9,8 calls per day. The typology of calls was in a quarter of the cases anxiety related to the fear of being infected, in the second quarter, adjustment disorders related to containment, and for about half of the calls, psychiatrics symptoms whether it was preexisting and increased by the discontinuation of care, or context-induced. The benefits identified by this device were as follows: -the discharge of time-consuming calls for the medical dispatcher assistant, -the expertise of a mental health professional, knowing the mental health network, to make the decision more fluid. Last but not least, it is interesting to note that the presence of the psychiatric regulator in the regulation room allowed a transfer of calls and a reciprocal acculturation. In view of the relevance of the establishment of a psychiatric regulation line in the epidemic context of Covid-19, it seems interesting to consider the sustainability of this system, which is part of a global context of evolution of the provision of emergency care.","Rougegrez, Dupont","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amp.2021.05.006","20210607","Call center; Covid-19; Feedback; Health crisis; Medico-psychological emergency team","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14439,""
"Mental Health of People with Dementia During COVID-19 Pandemic: What Have We Learned from the First Wave?","People with dementia (PWD) and their caregivers are populations highly vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences. A better knowledge of the living conditions during the first lockdown is necessary to prevent the risk of poor mental health (PMH) in this population. The present study aimed to compare the mental health of caregivers of PWD living at home or in nursing-homes and to identify specific factors influencing their mental health. We conducted an anonymous cross-sectional online survey in France from March 17 to May 11, 2020. Three hundred and eighty-nine caregivers accompanying a PWD living at home (HC) and 159 accompanying a PWD living in a nursing home (NHC) participated in the study. Caregivers' mental health including anxiety, depression, stress, and burden was assessed with self-reported standardized scales. Half of the caregivers exhibited PMH, including depression, anxiety, or self-reported stress. Similar PMH rates were provided whatever the PWD place of residence. Regarding HC, our results also highlighted a number of risk factors for PMH, including the fact that caregiver live with PWD, to give increased support to PWD, and to feel more isolated for managing PWD since lockdown. PMH was observed for caregivers of PWD during lockdown, whatever PWD living place, suggesting that concern for PWD may explain more of caregiver distress than increased material tasks. In the future, it will be necessary to pay attention to caregivers after the crisis by estimating the longer-term impact on their mental health.","Borg, Rouch, Pongan, Getenet, Bachelet, Herrmann, Bohec, Laurent, Rey, Dorey","https://doi.org/10.3233/JAD-210079","20210607","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; COVID-19; caregivers; dementia; lockdown; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14440,""
"Subjective Well-Being of Adolescents in Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil During the COVID-19 Pandemic","This study explores adolescent well-being during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in two high-income countries from Europe and one middle-income country from South America. The aim is to investigate the correlates of different dimensions of subjective well-being in 10- to 16-year-olds from different cultural contexts. An online, self-report questionnaire was completed by 1,613 adolescents in Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil between May and July 2020. The outcome variables were measures of life satisfaction and emotional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study included a range of sociodemographic, interpersonal, and intrapersonal covariates. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and latent variable structural equational modeling. A two-factor model of subjective well-being, consisting of life satisfaction and emotional well-being latent constructs, fitted well with this sample data for Luxembourg, Germany, and Brazil. Results showed that gender, socioeconomic status, intrapersonal factors, quantity and type of schoolwork, and relationships with adults were important common predictors of individual differences in subjective well-being during COVID-19. Fear of illness emerged as the strongest correlate of emotional well-being across the three countries. This study indicates that girls and adolescents from low-income homes may be especially vulnerable to negative secondary impacts of COVID-19 that can affect mental health. It identified several common correlates of subjective well-being in adolescents from different cultural settings, including factors that may be changeable, such as the following: the way adults listen to adolescents, schoolwork during distant learning, and fear of illness. Findings can inform the development of quality interventions for promoting the well-being of adolescents during a global pandemic.","Engel de Abreu, Neumann, Wealer, Abreu, Coutinho Macedo, Kirsch","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.04.028","20210607","Adolescents; Brazil; COVID-19; Emotional well-being; Germany; Life satisfaction; Luxembourg; Social distancing; Subjective well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14441,""
"Exposures and suspected intoxications during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: preliminary results from an Italian poison control centre","Data on cleaner and disinfectant exposure and misuse-related acute intoxications in Italy during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic are still lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyse and describe cleaner and disinfectant-related intoxications during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in an Italian poison control centre. Data were obtained from the toxicological consultations requested to the Toxicology Unit and Poison Centre, Careggi University Hospital, Florence (Italy). We compared data from January 1st to April 30th of 2019 and 2020. Data concerning probable or acute intoxication from any causative agent in the general population (all age groups), from private individuals or from Regional and National health structures, were included in the analysis. A toxicological evaluation was also performed to calculate the Poisoning Severity Score.In 2019, 451 phone counselling sessions were performed and compared to a total of 410 calls received during the same period of 2020. In both periods, the majority of events occurred in paediatric (0-17Ã‚Â years) and adult (18-65Ã‚Â years) patients, who were mainly exposed to one toxic agent, and intoxications took place principally at home due to domestic accidents. The oral route of intoxication was the most frequently observed one, followed by inhalation of toxic agents, which increased by 4.7% in 2020.

"Investigating the Impact of Job Loss and Decreased Work Hours on Physical and Mental Health Outcomes Among US Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic","To investigate associations between adverse changes in employment status and physical and mental health among US adults (more than or equal to 18Ã¢â‚¬Å years) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data from participants (NÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 2565) of a national Internet panel (June 2020) were assessed using path analyses to test associations between changes in self-reported employment status and hours worked and physical and mental health outcomes. Respondents who lost a job after March 1, 2020 (vs those who did not) reported more than twice the number of mentally unhealthy days. Women and those lacking social support had significantly worse physical and mental health outcomes. Participants in the lowest, pre-pandemic household income groups reported experiencing worse mental health. Results demonstrate the importance of providing social and economic support services to US adults experiencing poor mental and physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Guerin, Barile, Thompson, McKnight-Eily, Okun","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002288","20210606","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14443,""
"Disrupted access to therapies and impact on well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic for children with motor impairment and their caregivers","Determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on access to rehabilitation therapies, and the impact of changes in therapy access on the physical and mental well-being of children with motor impairment and their caregivers. Caregivers of children &lt;18 years old with childhood-onset motor impairment (primarily cerebral palsy) completed an anonymous survey through the online platform REDCap between May 5 and July 13, 2020. The survey was completed by 102 participants. Before the pandemic, 92 of 102 children (90%) were receiving one or more therapies; at the time surveyed, 55 children (54%) were receiving any therapies (p &lt; .001). Greater than 40% of the sample reported increased child stress, decreased physical activity, and/or decline in mobility/movement. Participants who reported a decrease in number of therapies at the time surveyed more frequently reported lower satisfaction with treatment delivery (p &lt; .001), decline in child's mobility (p = .001), and increased caregiver stress (p = .004). Five qualitative themes were identified from open-ended question responses related to therapies and well-being. Access to pediatric rehabilitation therapies was disrupted during COVID-19. Disrupted access may be related to impact on physical and mental health. With the expansion of telehealth, caregiver and child feedback should be incorporated to optimize benefit.","Sutter, Francis, Francis, Lench, Nemanich, Krach, Sukal-Moulton, Gillick","https://doi.org/10.1097/PHM.0000000000001818","20210606","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14444,""
"Impact of peritraumatic dissociation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia: A longitudinal study","Psychiatric impact of COVID-19 is still explored and previous data suggest potential risks of anxiety, depression and PTSD related to COVID-19. We aimed to explore the predictive value of risk factors during hospitalization (T0) for COVID-19 for anxiety, depression and PTSD and at three months (T1) because they could differ over these two time points. We performed a screening of mental suffering in hospitalized patients for COVID-19, as well as specialized care and three months longitudinal follow-up. We evaluated at T0 and at T1 the prevalence of anxiety, depression and PTSD in survivors who benefited from early detection and treatment, and assessed possible risk factors in adults surviving COVID-19 between the 30th March and the 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2020. 109 patients were screened at T0 and 61 of these were reassessed at T1. At T0, we found 44.9% pathological score on peritraumatic dissociation experiences questionnaire (PDEQ), 85.4% of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS), 14.6% of pathological rate of post-traumatic stress disorder scale 5 (PCL5) and at T1, 86.9% of PTSS, 10.6% of pathological rate of PCL5. Finally, PDEQ score at T0 during hospitalization was positively correlated to PCL-5 score at T1 (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.26, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01) and that was confirmed in multivariate analysis (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.04, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02 for the log of PCL-5 per point on the PDEQ). Screening of psychiatric symptoms during hospitalization for COVID-19 should be systematic, especially peritraumatic dissociation to offer an early treatment and prevent PTSD, which seemed frequent for hospitalized patients for COVID-19 at three months.","Benzakour, Braillard, Mazzola, Gex, Nehme, Perone, Agoritsas, Kopp, Sara, Bondolfi, Lador","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.05.031","20210606","Coronavirus infections; Pneumonia; Post traumatic; Risk factors; Stress disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14445,""

"Exhausted and Burned Out: COVID-19 Emerging Impacts Threaten the Health of the Pediatric Advanced Practice Registered Nursing Workforce","The purpose of this study was to describe the holistic impacts of COVID-19 on pediatric advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs). AA convenience sample of APRNs affiliated with the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners participated in this cross-sectional descriptive study. An investigator-developed survey explored multifocal, holistic impacts of COVID-19. A total of 886 participants were provided the survey, with 796 (90%) completing the entire survey. Respondents indicated adverse impacts across personal, clinical, educational, and research foci. Among the most alarming findings, 34% indicated moderate or extreme concern for feeling professionally burned out, 25% feeling nervous or anxious, and 15% feeling depressed or hopeless. The pediatricAPRN workforce pipeline is at significant risk for provider burnout and compromised mental health. Acknowledgment of pandemic-related trauma on families, children and APRNs is essential.

"Depressive symptoms, mental wellbeing, and substance use among adolescents before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Iceland: a longitudinal, population-based study","Adolescence represents a crucial developmental period in shaping mental health trajectories. In this study, we investigated the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and substance use during this sensitive developmental stage. In this longitudinal, population-based study, surveys were administered to a nationwide sample of 13-18-year-olds in Iceland in October or February in 2016 and 2018, and in October, 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic). The surveys assessed depressive symptoms with the Symptom Checklist-90, mental wellbeing with the Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, and the frequency of cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use, and alcohol intoxication. Demographic data were collected, which included language spoken at home although not ethnicity data. We used mixed effects models to study the effect of gender, age, and survey year on trends in mental health outcomes. 59Ã¢â‚¬â€°701 survey responses were included; response rates ranged from 63% to 86%. An increase in depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² 0Ã‚Â·57, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·53 to 0Ã‚Â·60) and worsened mental wellbeing (ÃŽÂ² -0Ã‚Â·46, 95% CI -0Ã‚Â·49 to -0Ã‚Â·42) were observed across all age groups during the pandemic compared with same-aged peers before COVID-19. These outcomes were significantly worse in adolescent girls compared with boys (ÃŽÂ² 4Ã‚Â·16, 95% CI 4Ã‚Â·05 to 4Ã‚Â·28, and ÃŽÂ² -1Ã‚Â·13, 95% CI -1Ã‚Â·23 to -1Ã‚Â·03, respectively). Cigarette smoking (OR 2Ã‚Â·61, 95% CI 2Ã‚Â·59 to 2Ã‚Â·66), e-cigarette use (OR 2Ã‚Â·61, 95% CI 2Ã‚Â·59 to 2Ã‚Â·64), and alcohol intoxication (OR 2Ã‚Â·59, 95% CI 2Ã‚Â·56 to 2Ã‚Â·64) declined among 15-18-year-olds during COVID-19, with no similar gender differences. Our results suggest that COVID-19 has significantly impaired adolescent mental health. However, the decrease observed in substance use during the pandemic might be an unintended benefit of isolation, and might serve as a protective factor against future substance use disorders and dependence. Population-level prevention efforts, especially for girls, are warranted. Icelandic Research Fund.

"A Mobile Intervention to Promote Low-Risk Drinking Habits in Young Adults: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial","Young adults' drinking habits commonly exceed recommendations for low-risk drinking, which may have a negative effect on their mental, social, and physical health. As smartphones are highly accessible to young adults, mobile apps could be used to support young adults to develop low-risk drinking habits and improve their general health. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Boozebuster, a self-guided mobile app based on healthy lifestyle-related components that aim to develop and maintain low-risk drinking habits among young adults. This two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will investigate whether a 6-week self-guided mobile intervention (Boozebuster) targeting drinking behavior is more effective than a minimal intervention consisting of an educational website on alcohol use and its consequences for young adults. We will recruit 506 young adults (aged 18-30 years) from the Netherlands via an open recruitment strategy by using an open access website. All outcomes will be self-assessed through questionnaires. The primary outcome is the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption in standard drinks (10 g ethanol per standard drink) per month (timeline follow-back [TLFB]). Secondary outcomes include binge-drinking sessions per month, alcohol-related problem severity (Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index), cannabis use frequency and quantity in grams (TLFB), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale), engagement (Twente Engagement with eHealth Technologies Scale), readiness to change (Readiness to Change Questionnaire), mental well-being (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale), trauma and COVID-19-related trauma (Short-Form Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition), impulsivity (Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking, Positive Urgency Impulsive Behavior Scale), study or work performance (Individual Work Performance Questionnaire), and treatment adherence. Baseline (T0), 6-week postbaseline (T1), and 3-month postbaseline (T2) assessments will be conducted and analyzed on the basis of the intention-to-treat principle using multilevel mixed modeling analyses. Recruitment began in September 2020. We received 933 registrations via our study information website; 506 participants have completed the T0 assessment, 336 participants have completed the T1 assessment, and 308 participants have completed the T2 assessment as of May 2021. The study is still in progress, and results will be reported in 2021 and 2022. Self-guided mobile interventions based on a lifestyle approach might be an attractive approach for young adults due to their preference on self-reliance, healthy living, and increased perceived anonymity. Such interventions are yet understudied, and it is known that interventions addressing solely problem drinking are less appealing to young adults. We hypothesize that the Boozebuster mobile app will effectively reduce drinking levels compared to an alcohol educational website (control condition). If effective, our intervention could be an inexpensive and scalable public health intervention to improve drinking habits in young adults.

"Cognitive emotion regulation strategies mediate the relationships between Dark Triad traits and negative emotional states experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic","COVID-19 has become a major source of stress as it puts individuals at risk of a range of mental health problems. Personality traits may predispose people to use adaptive or maladaptive coping strategies that lead to different health-related outcomes. The goal of the present study was to examine whether the use of distinct coping strategies during this stressful COVID-19 outbreak mediates the relationships between Dark Triad (DT) traits and stress, depression, and anxiety. The study was conducted in Poland (NÂ =Â 1086) and Spain (NÂ =Â 582), thus cross-culturally validated measures were used to assess depression, anxiety and stress (DASS-21), cognitive emotion regulation strategies (CERQ) and socially aversive traits covered by DT (Dirty Dozen scale). The study shows that maladaptive CERS mediates the relationships between narcissism/Machiavellianism and stress, anxiety and depression. Additionally, adaptive CERS mediates the relationship between psychopathy and depression. The results provide a better understanding of the mediating role of CERS on the relationships between DT traits and the stress, anxiety and depression experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111018","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-06-08","",14453,""
