"Mental Health and Time Management Behavior among Students During COVID-19 Pandemic: Towards Persuasive Technology Design","The study explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on students' mental health in higher education while capturing their perceptions and attitudes towards time management. The aim was to examine relationships between stress, anxiety, and specific time management related factors. Considering possible differences between genders and degree levels, we developed five structural equation models (SEMs) to delineate these relationships. Results of a large-scale study of 502 participants show that students suffered from stress and two types of COVID-19-related anxiety: disease and consequences. Students' preference for organization was the only factor that significantly promoted their perceived control over time, which contributes to reducing stress, hence, anxiety. However, female students reported higher stress and anxiety levels than male students. Graduate students reported higher anxiety levels related to the consequences of the pandemic compared to undergrads. To promote students' preference for organization, we map the three categories of organization to corresponding persuasive strategies which could be used in the design of persuasive interventions. This creates an opportunity for developing technological interventions to improve students' perceived control over time, thus, reduce stress and anxiety.","Mona Alhasani; Ali Alkhawaji; Rita Orji","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.01.21264409","20211001","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18498,""
"Association between time spent with family and loneliness among Japanese workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Background: The current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had large impacts on society, including people practicing social distancing. This behavioral response has increased loneliness. Loneliness not only increases the risk of psychiatric disorders, but also affects occupational mental health. To avoid the negative effects of isolation, it is important to have social contact with other people, especially family members. Employment and economic instability caused by COVID-19 may have also affected family relationships. It is important to understand the association between family relationships and loneliness in workers under the pandemic. Methods: We collected usable data from 27,036 Japanese workers who completed an online survey during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were asked how long they spend with members of their family during mealtimes or at home, and if they experienced loneliness; the latter was assessed by a single question. Other questions included whether participants lived with their spouse, or with someone in need of care. To estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of time with family associated with loneliness we used a multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence, with adjustments for age, sex, marital status, presence of a cohabitant requiring care, equivalent income, educational level, frequency of remote work, availability of someone for casual chat, smoking, drinking, time for leisure interests, and cumulative rates of COVID-19 in the prefecture. Results: Ten percent (2,750) of the 27,036 participants reported loneliness. The survey showed a significant negative correlation between time spent with family and loneliness (p<0.001): participants who spent more time with family were less likely to feel loneliness. In addition, not living with a spouse and living with someone in need of care were associated with loneliness (not living with a spouse: p<0.001; living with someone in need of care: p<0.001). Conclusion: Loneliness under COVID-19 pandemic conditions was negatively associated with time spent with family members, with the converse result found for participants cohabiting with someone in need of care. These associations suggest the potential value of changes to working practices and interventions to combat loneliness.","Rintaro Fujii; Yusuke Konno; Seiichiro Tateishi; Ayako Hino; Mayumi Tsuji; Kazunori Ikegami; Masako Nagata; Reiji Yoshimura; Shinya Matsuda; Yoshihisa Fujino","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.09.30.21264346","20211001","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18499,""
"The impact of the national stay-at-home order on emergency department visits for suspected opioid overdose during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic","Although national syndromic surveillance data reported declines in emergency department (ED) visits after the declaration of the national stay-at-home order for COVID-19, little is known whether these declines were observed for suspected opioid overdose. This interrupted time series study used syndromic surveillance data from four states participating in the HEALing Communities Study: Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, and Ohio. All ED encounters for suspected opioid overdose (n = 48,301) occurring during the first 31 weeks of 2020 were included. We examined the impact of the national public health emergency for COVID-19 (declared on March 14, 2020) on trends in ED encounters for suspected opioid overdose. Three of four states (Massachusetts, New York and Ohio) experienced a statistically significant immediate decline in the rate of ED encounters for suspected opioid overdose (per 100,000) after the nationwide public health emergency declaration (MA: -0.99; 95 % CI: -1.75, -0.24; NY: -0.10; 95 % CI, -0.20, 0.0; OH: -0.33, 95 % CI: -0.58, -0.07). After this date, Ohio and Kentucky experienced a sustained rate of increase for a 13-week period. New York experienced a decrease in the rate of ED encounters for a 10-week period, after which the rate began to increase. In Massachusetts after a significant immediate decline in the rate of ED encounters, there was no significant difference in the rate of change for a 6-week period, followed by an immediate increase in the ED rate to higher than pre-COVID levels. The heterogeneity in the trends in ED encounters between the four sites show that the national stay-at-home order had a differential impact on opioid overdose ED presentation in each state.","Root, Slavova, LaRochelle, Feaster, Villani, Defiore-Hyrmer, El-Bassel, Ergas, Gelberg, Jackson, Manchester, Parikh, Rock, Walsh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2021.108977","20211001","COVID-19; Emergency department encounter; HEALing Communities Study; Opioid use disorder; Segmented regression; Syndromic surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18500,""
"Exploring impact on eating behaviour, exercise and well-being during COVID-19 restrictions in the Netherlands","Many studies address the effect of the COVID-19 restrictions on food consumption and health, focusing on one or two measurements. Whether or not any effects are permanent or change over a longer period of restrictions has not been assessed in such studies. This study presented a survey containing questions on food consumption, exercise and self-assessed physical and mental health, repeatedly for six times over a 20-week period (July to November 2020) to a representative sample of 258 Dutch consumers. The majority of consumers reported no change in food consumption compared to before the COVID-19 restrictions, two smaller groups report a change to a more, or a less, healthy choice. This trend appears stable over the course of the measurements. The 'healthy changers' seem to couple a healthy and more diverse diet to healthy exercise habits, in contrast to the 'unhealthy changers'. No change was observed in self-assessed physical health over the measurements. Overall a decline in time spent exercising showed, as well as a decline in self-assessed mental health. Clearly a lockdown situation affects food choice, exercise habits and (self-assessed) mental health. The fact that habits are able to suddenly change, for better or for worse, and that a decrease in mental health was reported, suggests that such insights need to be further explored to help individual consumers retain a healthy diet and lifestyle, and governments devise effective public health recommendations.","Dijksterhuis, van Bergen, de Wijk, Zandstra, Kaneko, Vingerhoeds","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105720","20211001","COVID-19 lockdown; Eating behavior; Exercise; Health; Mental well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18501,""
"Depressive Symptoms Among Older Adults Pre- and Post-COVID-19 Pandemic","It is a concern that public health measures to prevent older people contracting COVID-19 could lead to a rise in mental health problems such as depression. The aim of this study therefore is to examine trends of depressive symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a large cohort of older people. Observational study with 6-year follow-up. More than 3000 community-dwelling adults aged Ã¢â€°Â¥60Ã‚Â years participating in The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (TILDA). Mixed effects multilevel models were used to describe trends in depressive symptoms across 3 waves of TILDA: wave 4 (2016), wave 5 (2018), and a final wave conducted July-November 2020. Depressive symptoms were measured using the 8-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), with a score Ã¢â€°Â¥9 indicating clinically significant symptoms. The prevalence of clinically significant depressive symptoms at waves 4 and 5 was 7.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 6.5, 7.9] and 7.2% (95% CI 6.5, 8.0), respectively. This more than doubled to 19.8% (95% CI 18.5, 21.2) during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no change in CES-D scores between waves 4 and 5 (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â = 0.09, 95% CI -0.04, 0.23), but a large increase in symptoms was observed during the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â = 2.20, 95% CI 2.07, 2.33). Age Ã¢â€°Â¥70Ã‚Â years was independently associated with depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â = 0.45, 95% CI 0.18, 0.72) during the pandemic but not from wave 4 to 5 (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â = 0.09, 95% CI -0.18, 0.36). Living with others was associated with a lower burden of symptoms during the pandemic (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.40, 95% CI -0.71,Ã‚Â -0.09) but not between waves 4 and 5 (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.40, 95% CI -0.71,Ã‚Â -0.09). This study demonstrates significant increases in the burden of depressive symptoms among older people during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly those aged Ã¢â€°Â¥70Ã‚Â years and/or living alone. Even a small increase in the incidence of late life depression can have major implications for health care systems and societies in general. Improving access to age-attuned mental health care should therefore be a priority.","Briggs, McDowell, De Looze, Kenny, Ward","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2021.09.003","20211001","COVID-19; Depression; shielding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18502,""
"The Effect of COVID-19 on Anxiety Levels of Children with CF and Healthy Peers","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic disease causing recurrent respiratory tract infections. Viral respiratory tract infections are more severe in CF. The first case of COVID-19 was seen in our country on March 11, 2020 and nationwide school closure and lockdown were implemented. School closure and home confinement might have adverse effects on children's physical and mental health. In this study, we aimed to compare the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on psychological reactions of CF patients and healthy controls. This is a controlled cross-sectional study including 7-18 year-old children with CF. The survey included questions regarding family environment and peer relations, self care and psychological reactions to COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was applied to children via telephone call under parental supervision. We evaluated 132 CF patients and 135 their healthy peers. Mean age was 11.5Ã‚Â±2.9 years in CF group and 11.8Ã‚Â±3.2 years in control group (p=0.98). There were 55 girls (41.7%) in CF group and 81 girls (60%) in control group (p=0.027). The socioeconomic status of families was similar. CF patients were found to be less anxious for family members having the risk of COVID-19, less upset for school closure, less anxious about the COVID-19 pandemic (p&lt;0.001, 0.02, 0.01 respectively). CF patients seem to show more resilience in coping with the pandemic. Appropriate psychological support should be provided to them and resilience strategies in coping with the pandemic should be nurtured.","Yanaz, Yilmaz Yegit, Ergenekon, Toksoy Aksoy, Bilicen, Gokdemir, Erdem Eralp, Rodopman Arman, Karakoc, Karadag","https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.15009","20211001","Anxiety; COVID-19; Coping; Cystic Fibrosis; IntroductÃ„Â±on","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18503,""
"The Role of Tailored Public Health Messaging to Young Adults during COVID-19: ""There's a lot of ambiguity around what it means to be safe""","The COVID-19 global incidence rate among young adults (age 19-40) drastically increased since summer 2020, and young adults were often portrayed by popular media as the ""main spreader"" of the pandemic. However, young adults faced unique challenges during the pandemic due to working in high-risk, low-paying essential service occupations, as well as having higher levels of financial insecurity and mental burden. This qualitative study aims to examine the attitudes and perceptions of health orders of young adults to better inform public health messaging to reach this demographic and increase compliance to public health orders. A total of 50 young adults residing in British Columbia, Canada, were recruited to participate in focus group in groups of four to six. Focus group discussions were conducted via teleconferencing. Thematic analysis revealed four major themes: 1) risks of contracting the disease, 2) the perceived impact of COVID-19, 3) responsibility of institutions, 4) and effective public health messaging. Contrary to existing literature, our findings suggest young adults feel highly responsible for protecting themselves and others. They face a higher risk of depression and anxiety compared to other age groups, especially when they take on multiple social roles such as caregivers and parents. Our findings suggest young adults face confusion due to inconsistent messaging and are not reached due to the ineffectiveness of existing strategies. We recommend using evidence-based strategies proven to promote behaviour change to address the barriers identified by young adults through tailoring public health messages, specifically by using positive messaging, messaging that considers the context of the intended audiences, and utilizing digital platforms to facilitate two-way communication.","Cheng, Horbay, Nocos, Lutes, Lear","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258121","20211001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18504,""

From four COVID-19-dedicated hospitals in Korea, 381 HCWs were analyzed to estimate anxiety in relation to four COVID-19 job stressors and the impact of shift work on this relationship. Anxiety was measured with a generalized anxiety disorder 7-item scale. Multiple logistic regression models were utilized after stratification by sex, occupation, and shift work, after adjusting for a number of variables. Anxiety prevalence was 32%. Among female nurses or nursing assistants who performed shift work, anxiety risk was significantly associated with three COVID-19 related job stressors: contact with confirmed cases or patients, dealing with unpleasant patients, and discomfort from wearing protective equipment. Special attention is required for mental health of HCWs working shifts during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Park, Lee, Kim, Jung","https://doi.org/10.1097/JOM.0000000000002250","20211001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18505,""
"Adolescents' assessments of consequences of the pandemic after one year of COVID-19Ã‚Â restrictions","We have obtained knowledge of how the COVID-19Ã‚Â pandemic affected the lives of adolescents immediately after the pandemic arrived in Norway.

"Association of Children's Physical Activity and Screen Time With Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Children's physical activity and screen time are likely suboptimal during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may influence their current and future mental health. To describe the association of physical activity and screen time with mental health among US children during the pandemic. This cross-sectional survey was conducted from October 22 to November 2, 2020, among 547 parents of children aged 6 to 10 years and 535 parent-child dyads with children and adolescents (hereinafter referred to as children) aged 11 to 17 years and matched down to 500 children per cohort using US Census-based sampling frames. Children aged 11 to 17 years self-reported physical activity, screen time, and mental health, and their parents reported other measures. Parents of children aged 6 to 10 years reported all measures. All 1000 cases were further weighted to a sampling frame corresponding to US parents with children aged 6 to 17 years using propensity scores. Child physical activity, screen time, COVID-19 stressors, and demographics. Mental health using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire for total difficulties and externalizing and internalizing symptoms. Among the 1000 children included in the analysis (mean [SD] age, 10.8 [3.5] years; 517 [52.6%] boys; 293 [31.6%] American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or Black individuals or individuals of other race; and 233 [27.8%] Hispanic/Latino individuals), 195 (20.9%) reported at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day. Children reported a mean (SD) of 3.9 (2.2) d/wk with at least 60 minutes of physical activity and 4.4 (2.5) h/d of recreational screen time. COVID-19 stressors were significantly associated with higher total difficulties for both younger (ÃŽÂ² coefficient,Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.6; 95% CI, 0.3-0.9) and older (ÃŽÂ² coefficient, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.0-0.7) groups.

"Global Research on Coronaviruses: A Metadata-Based Analysis for Public Health Policies","Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article suggests a data science strategy for analyzing global research on coronaviruses. The application of reproducible research principles founded on text-as-data, open science, the dissemination of scientific data, and easy access to scientific production may aid public health in the fight against the virus. The primary goal of this article is to use global research on coronaviruses to identify critical elements that can help inform public health policy decisions. We present a data science framework to assist policymakers in implementing cutting-edge data science techniques for the purpose of developing evidence-based public health policies. We use the EpiBibR package to gain access to coronavirus research documents worldwide (n = 121,231) and their associated metadata. To analyze these data, we first employ a theoretical framework to group the findings into three categories: conceptual, intellectual, and social. Second, we map the results of our analysis in these three dimensions using machine learning techniques (natural language processing) and social network analysis. Our findings are first methodological in nature. They demonstrate the potential for the proposed data science framework to be applied to public health policies. Additionally, our findings indicate that the United States and China are the primary contributors to global coronavirus research. They also demonstrate that India and Europe are significant contributors, albeit in a secondary position. University collaborations in this domain are strong between the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, confirming the country-level findings. Our findings argue for a data-driven approach to public health policy, particularly when efficient and relevant research is required. Text mining techniques can assist policymakers in calculating evidence-based indices and informing their decision-making process regarding specific actions necessary for effective health responses.","Warin","https://doi.org/10.2196/31510","20211001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18508,""
"Young Adults' responses to an African and US-based COVID-19 edutainment miniseries: a real-time qualitative analysis of online social media engagement","In April 2020, as cases of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread across the globe, MTV Staying Alive Foundation created the educational entertainment miniseries MTV Shuga: Alone Together. In 70 short episodes released daily on YouTube, Alone Together aimed to disseminate timely and accurate information to increase young people's knowledge, motivation and actions to prevent COVID-19. We sought to identify Alone Together viewer's perspectives on the global COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdowns by examining the words, conversations, experiences and emotions expressed on social media in response to the Alone Together episodes. We also assessed how viewers used the series and its online community as a source of support during the global pandemic. 3,982 comments and 70 live chat conversations were extracted from YouTube between April-October 2020 and analysed through a data-led inductive thematic approach. Aggregated demographic and geographical data were collected using YouTube Analytics. The miniseries had a global reach across five continents, with a total of 7.7 million views across MTV Shuga platforms. The series had over 1 million views over 70 episodes on YouTube and an average of 5,683 unique viewers per episode on YouTube. The dominant audience was adults under the age of 35 and women. Across diverse countries like Nigeria, Ghana, the USA and the UK, Viewers believed that COVID-19 was serious and expressed that it was socially responsible to follow public health measures. The series storylines about the impact of self-isolation on mental health, exposure to violence in lockdowns and restricted employment opportunities due to the pandemic resonated with young viewers. Tuning in to the miniseries provided viewers with reliable information, entertainment, and an online community during an isolating, confusing and worrying time. During the first wave of COVID-19, viewers from at least 53 countries connected on social media via the MTV miniseries. The analysis showed how digitally connected people under the age of 35, predominantly women, felt compelled to follow COVID-19 safety measures despite the pandemic's impact on their social, educational and financial needs. Viewers used social media to reach out to fellow viewers for advice, solace, support and resources. Organisations, governments and individuals have been forced to innovate during the pandemic to ensure people can access services safely and remotely. This analysis showed that women under 35 were especially receptive to receiving support from online communities and media services. Peer influence and support online can be a powerful public health tool as people have a great capacity to influence each other and shape norms around public health. However, online services are not accessible to everyone, and COVID-19 has increased disparities between digitally connected and unconnected younger adults.","Baker, Arnold, Piot, Thwala, Glynn, Hargreaves, Birdthistle","https://doi.org/10.2196/30449","20211001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18509,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic on patients with neuroendocrine tumors: Between resilience and vulnerability","The COVID-19 pandemic has added another layer of complexity to the fears of patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Little is known regarding the psychological impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on patients with gastroenteropancreatic or bronchopulmonary (BP) NETs. We longitudinally surveyed the mental symptoms and concerns of NET patients during the plateau phase of the first (W1) and second epidemic waves (W2) in Italy. Seven specific constructs (depression, anxiety, stress, health-related quality of life, NET-related quality of life, patient-physician relationship, psychological distress) were investigated using validated screening instruments, including DASS-21, EORTC QLQ-C30, EORTC QLQ GI.NET21, PDRQ9 and IES-R. We enrolled 197 patients (98Ã‚Â males) with a median age of 62Ã‚Â years. The majority of the patients had G1/G2 neoplasms. Some 38% of the patients were on active treatment. At W1, the prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress was 32%, 36% and 26% respectively. The frequency of depression and anxiety increased to 38% and 41% at W2, whereas no modifications were recorded in the frequency of stress. Poor educational status was associated with higher levels of anxiety at both W1 (odds ratio [OR]Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.33Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.22; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .07) and W2 (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.45Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 0.26; pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03).

No significant deteriorations of health-related quality of life domains were observed from W1 to W2. High patient care satisfaction was documented despite the changes in health systems resource allocation. NET patients have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress symptoms as result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specific screening measures and psychological interventions should be implemented in NET clinics to prevent, recognize and treat mental distress in this vulnerable population.","Lauricella, Cives, Bracigliano, Clemente, Felici, Lippolis, Amoruso, Pelle', Mandriani, Esposto, Forte, Perri, Porta, Tafuto","https://doi.org/10.1111/jne.13041","20211001","HRQoL; anxiety; carcinoid; depression; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18510,""
"Changes in Children's Behavioral Health and Family Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and associated public health measures have influenced all aspects of life for children and families. In this study, we examine changes in children's behavioral health and families' well-being at the start of the pandemic. We used longitudinal data on 2880 children from 1 US state collected over 3 waves to compare family and child well-being before and after a state-wide stay-at-home advisory set in March 2020. We descriptively examined levels and changes in 4 child behavioral health outcomes (externalizing, internalizing, adaptive, and dysregulated behaviors) and 4 family well-being outcomes (parental mental health, parental stress, parent-child relationship conflict, and household chaos) across the preshutdown and postshutdown periods. Fixed effects regression models were used to predict within-child and within-family differences in preshutdown and postshutdown outcomes. Fixed effects analyses showed children's externalizing (0.09 points; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.05-0.13), internalizing (0.04 points; 95% CI, 0.01-0.08), and dysregulated (0.11 points; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) behaviors increased after the shutdown, whereas children's adaptive behaviors declined (-0.10 points; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.05). Parental mental health issues (0.22 points; 95% CI, 0.17-0.27), parental stress (0.08 points; 95% CI, 0.03-0.12), parent-child relationship conflict (0.10 points; 95% CI, 0.04-0.16), and household chaos (0.10 points; 95% CI, 0.05-0.14) all increased relative to preshutdown levels. Many children experienced declines in behavioral health and many families experienced declines in well-being in the early months of the public health crisis, suggesting the need for family-focused and child-focused policies to mitigate these changes.","Hanno, Cuartas, Miratrix, Jones, Lesaux","https://doi.org/10.1097/DBP.0000000000001010","20211001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18511,""
"Speech-language Pathology Approaches to Neurorehabilitation in Acute Care During COVID-19: Capitalizing on Neuroplasticity","Neurologic manifestations associated with a COVID-19 diagnosis are common and often occur in severe and critically ill patients. In these patients, the neurologic symptoms are confounded by critical care conditions, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Patients with dual diagnoses of COVID-19 and neurologic changes such as myopathy, polyneuropathy, and stroke are likely at a higher risk to experience deficits with swallowing, communication, and/or cognition. Speech-language pathologists are an integral part of both the critical care and neurological disorders multi-disciplinary teams, offering valuable contributions in the evaluation, treatment, and management of these areas. Patients in intensive care units (ICUs) who require mechanical ventilation often experience difficulty with communication and benefit from early speech-language pathology intervention to identify the most efficient communication methods with the medical team and caregivers. Moreover, patients with neurologic manifestations may present with cognitive-linguistic impairments such as aphasia, increasing the need for communication-based interventions. Difficulties with voice and swallowing after extubation are common, often requiring frequent treatment sessions, possibly persisting beyond ICU discharge. After leaving the ICU, patients with COVID-19 often experience physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments collectively called post-intensive care syndrome. This is often a lengthy road as they progress toward full recovery, requiring continued speech-language pathology treatment after hospital discharge, capitalizing on the principles of neuroplasticity.

"Pandemic-related racial discrimination and its health impact among non-Indigenous racially minoritized peoples in high-income contexts: a systematic review","This study aims to review articles reporting the perspectives and experiences of pandemic-related discrimination among racially minoritized peoples in high-income contexts. We searched online databases (Medline, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and ProQuest) for peer-reviewed articles published between January 2002 and October 2020. Eligible studies reported either quantitative or qualitative accounts of pandemic-related discrimination from the perspectives of racially minoritized peoples in high-income contexts. Two authors screened 30% of titles/abstracts, and all full-text articles. Each article included for extraction underwent a quality assessment by two reviewers. Data were extracted and categorized thematically using NVivo 12, followed by a secondary analysis informed by critical race theory. Of the 1289 articles screened, 16 articles from five countries met the inclusion criteria. Racial discrimination is heightened during pandemic periods, due to the social association of specific racial groups with pandemic diseases including COVID-19, SARS (Asian), H1N1 (Hispanic) and Ebola (African). Fear based responses to racially minoritized peoples during pandemic periods included verbal/physical abuse, hypersurveillance, and avoidance, often occurring in public spaces. Pandemic-related racism had subsequent impacts on mental health and health care accessibility. Various coping strategies, including community support, avoidance, and problem solving, were documented in response to racial discrimination. Racialized discrimination and violence is a serious threat to the health and wellbeing of racially minoritized peoples, particularly due to its increase during pandemic periods. Racism must be recognized as a public health issue, and efforts to address its increased impact in pandemic contexts should be made, including ensuring that adequate representation of racially minoritized groups is present in policy, planning, and implementation.","Yashadhana, Derbas, Biles, Grant","https://doi.org/10.1093/heapro/daab144","20211001","ethnic minorities; pandemic; public health; racial discrimination; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18513,""
"Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown on Mental Well-Being of Norwegian Adolescents During the First Wave-Socioeconomic Position and Gender Differences","<b>Background:</b> The lockdowns associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been called a crisis in mental health, and adolescents may have been among the most affected. Comparing the first period of societal lockdown in spring 2020 to periods going back to 2014 using a rich cross-sectional dataset based on repeated surveys, we explore the potential changes in self-reported mental well-being across sociodemographic groups among Norway's adolescents. <b>Methods:</b> Norway closed schools and implemented strict restrictions in March 2020; an electronic questionnaire survey was distributed to lower secondary school students in TrÃƒÂ¸ndelag county (<i>N</i> = 2,443) in May 2020. Results were compared with similar surveys conducted annually in the same county dating back to 2014. Logistic regression models were applied to investigate potential changes in depressive symptoms, loneliness, and quality of life and life satisfaction, and to detect possible differences in the impact of lockdown between the genders and socioeconomic groups. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of boys and girls reporting high quality of life (43-34%; 23-16%) and life satisfaction (91-80%; 82-69%) decreased significantly compared to the pre-pandemic. For girls only, lockdown was associated with higher odds for reporting high depressive symptoms. As expected, the least privileged socioeconomic groups showed the greatest psychological distress. However, our trend analyses provided no evidence that the socioeconomic inequalities in psychological distress (according to prevalence of high depressive symptoms or loneliness) changed substantial in any direction during the first wave of the pandemic [between the pre-pandemic and inter-pandemic periods]. <b>Conclusion:</b> Adolescents are vulnerable, and interventions should provide them with mental health support during crises such as societal lockdown. In particular, the social and health policy, public health, and further research should target these least privileged groups.","Myhr, Naper, Samarawickrema, Vesterbekkmo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.717747","20211001","COVID-19; Norway; adolescents; lower secondary school; mental well-being; socioeconomic inequalities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18514,""
"Psychological Distress and Happiness of Men Who Have Sex With Men and Transgender People During the Coronavirus Disease-19 Pandemic: Is There a Need for Public Health Policy Intervention?","Since the global onset of COVID-19 in early 2020, the disease has significantly impacted mental health. This impact is likely to be further exacerbated for groups who were already marginalized. This paper shares results from a broader study of men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people in Bali, Indonesia and includes a focus on psychological distress and happiness during the COVID-19 pandemic; applying sociodemographic and epidemiological characteristics as potential mediators. Psychological distress and the level of happiness were measured by The Kessler Psychological Distress (K10) and the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS). A cross-sectional survey was conducted from July to September 2020. Of the 416 participants, complete data were available for 363 participants. The majority of participants were aged 26-40 years, currently single, were born outside Bali, were currently living in an urban area, and over one-third were living with HIV. While all were MSM, the majority identified as homosexual/tend to be homosexual (71.3%), however 54 (14.9%) identified themselves as heterosexual. The majority (251, 69.1%) reported moderate to very high psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. The binary logistic regression analysis identified five factors to be significantly associated with higher psychological distress: being a student, reporting higher levels of stigma, had ever experienced discrimination, felt better prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and less happy than the average person. When homosexual were compared with heterosexual participants, those who identified themselves as being homosexual reported significantly lower psychological distress compared to those identified themselves as heterosexual, which may be associated with these participants not disclosing their status as MSM and the stigma around MSM. Those who considered themselves to be less happy than the average person (316, 87.1%) were more likely to live with a partner and to report moderate to very high psychological distress. Based on the findings, interventions should focus on strategies to reduce stigma, provide non-discriminatory services, and improve access to essential health services.","Septarini, Hendriks, Maycock, Burns","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.647548","20211001","COVID-19; MSM; happiness; intervention; mental health; psychological distress; transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18515,""
"Health Status and Food Intake Frequency of Elderly Residents During COVID-19 Community Closure - Jiangxia District, Wuhan City, China, 2020","<b>What is already known about this topic?</b> Elderly persons are vulnerable to infectious diseases, and nutritional status and health conditions were important to evaluate for disease prevention and ability to recover for the elderly during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. <b>What is added by this report?</b> In our study, a rapid assessment questionnaire was used to investigate the change of household life and dietary intake of the elderly (aged 60 years or more) during community closure. Food consumption frequency of aquatic food products, soybeans, and fresh fruits declined dramatically with reductions of 70.9%, 70.9%, and 53.0%, respectively, and 49.6% of the elderly lived with chronic non-communicable diseases but had little knowledge of nutrition and health. <b>What are the implications for public health practice?</b> Community closure measures in Wuhan City have played a key role in cutting off the transmission route of COVID-19 and protecting vulnerable groups. As a high-risk population, the elderly should be advised to maintain and strengthen a balanced diet with proper nutrition through increasing intake of aquatic food products, soybeans, fruits, and vegetables, reducing total caloric intake, and decreasing oil and salt consumption. These measures will be significant for the elderly to reduce the risk of chronic disease complications and COVID-19 infection and to decrease the chance of critical illness.","Song, Li, Feng, Zhang, Li, Yang, Dong, Liu, Zhang, Liu, Wang, Ge, Yu, Ding","https://doi.org/10.46234/ccdcw2020.120","20211001","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18516,""
"Place Affect Interventions During and After the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 health and economic crisis has also brought a rise in people being unable to cope with their existing medical conditions and other issues such as domestic violence, drugs, and alcohol among others. Suicidal tendencies have been on the rise. Feelings of isolation causing emotional distress in place-confined settings have put additional pressure on the healthcare systems demanding that we find additional and complementary means of support for those in need. This is important not only in the current pandemic but also in the post-pandemic world. The goal is to collectively contribute and address the recurring calls for actions to maintain global well-being and public health. An important discussion to bring on the table is the need to promote interventions for people to cope with the pandemic and to adjust to the post-pandemic world. Promoting affective attitudes toward place can foster well-being outcomes. This has important benefits and is of relevance to governments, policymakers, and healthcare professionals in delivering better healthcare equipping people with coping mechanisms both throughout the pandemic and in the long run. However, the key challenge is how to foster these place affect attitudes meeting the changing demands in the post-pandemic world. It is in the middle of a crisis that the conversation needs to start about how to strategically plan for the recovery.","Ramkissoon","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.726685","20211001","COVID-19 pandemic; behavior change; health; interventions; mental well-being; place affect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18517,""
"The Relationship Between State Loneliness and Depression Among Youths During COVID-19 Lockdown: Coping Style as Mediator","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a great impact on public mental health. However, loneliness during the lockdown related to depression and whether the relationship would be mediated by coping style or whether sex moderates loneliness and coping style are not clear. The study aimed to examine the mediating role of coping style in the relationship between state loneliness and depression as well as the moderating role of sex in the relationship between state loneliness and coping styles during the COVID-19 lockdown. Participants were 337 college students in China during the COVID-19 pandemic (January-February 2020). States of depression and anxiety, state loneliness, and coping styles with COVID-19 were measured. The results show that loneliness was an effective predictor of depression during self-quarantine. Moreover, coping style mediated the relationship between state loneliness and depression although sex did not moderate the relationship between state loneliness and coping style. Youths were inclined to use more positive coping strategies than negative coping strategies. Our results indicate less loneliness is an effective way to relieve depression, and coping strategies, especially the positive ones, are important for youths to prevent depression and loneliness during the lockdown of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zhang, Huang, Luo, Ai","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.701514","20211001","COVID-19; coping style; depression; loneliness; mediator","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18518,""

"Prevalence and Risk Factors of Home Quarantine Strategy Implementation Among Chinese Residents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> Home quarantine is an important strategy to contain the mass spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, there are a dearth of studies on the prevalence and risk factors of home quarantine strategy implementation among residents. This study aims to assess the state of home quarantine strategy implementation among Chinese residents, which could provide a reference for quarantine policymakers around the world during the pandemic. <b>Method:</b> We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 3,398 residents in China by adopting a convenience sampling strategy. We measured the prevalence and risk factors of home quarantine strategy implementation with the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), 10-item Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC 10), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS). A multivariable model was used to determine the factors associated with home quarantine strategy implementation. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,936 (86.4%) respondents carried out home quarantine. There were some factors significantly associated with home quarantine strategy implementation among Chinese residents during the COVID-19 outbreak. Respondents who were male, lived in western and central China, were aware of the primary symptoms of COVID-19, were willing to accept recommendations on relevant protective measures, understood local quarantine measures, had better resilience, and had better social support were more likely to engage in home quarantine. Respondents who were married, were employed, were healthy, and had high depression scores were more likely to refuse to follow home quarantine guidance. <b>Conclusions:</b> Gender, region, marital status, employment status, health status, awareness of the primary symptoms of COVID-19, willingness to accept recommendations on relevant protective measures, understanding of local quarantine measures, depression, psychological resilience, and perceived social support were the main factors affecting the implementation of residents' home quarantine strategy.

"Threats to Global Mental Health From Unregulated Digital Phenotyping and Neuromarketing: Recommendations for COVID-19 Era and Beyond","The new era of digitalized knowledge and information technology (IT) has improved efficiency in all medical fields, and digital health solutions are becoming the norm. There has also been an upsurge in utilizing digital solutions during the COVID-19 pandemic to address the unmet mental healthcare needs, especially for those unable to afford in-person office-based therapy sessions or those living in remote rural areas with limited access to mental healthcare providers. Despite these benefits, there are significant concerns regarding the widespread use of such technologies in the healthcare system. A few of those concerns are a potential breach in the patients' privacy, confidentiality, and the agency of patients being at risk of getting used for marketing or data harnessing purposes. Digital phenotyping aims to detect and categorize an individual's behavior, activities, interests, and psychological features to properly customize future communications or mental care for that individual. Neuromarketing seeks to investigate an individual's neuronal response(s) (cortical and subcortical autonomic) characteristics and uses this data to direct the person into purchasing merchandise of interest, or shaping individual's opinion in consumer, social or political decision making, etc. This commentary's primary concern is the intersection of these two concepts that would be an inevitable threat, more so, in the post-COVID era when disparities would be exaggerated globally. We also addressed the potential ""dark web"" applications in this intersection, worsening the crisis. We intend to raise attention toward this new threat, as the impacts might be more damming in low-income settings or/with vulnerable populations. Legal, health ethics, and government regulatory processes looking at broader impacts of digital marketing need to be in place.","Akbarialiabad, Bastani, Taghrir, Paydar, Ghahramani, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.713987","20211001","data privacy; digital mental health regulations; digital neuromarketing; digital phenotyping; global mental health; lower and middle income counteries","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18521,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Family Wellbeing in the Context of Neurodevelopmental Disorders","The primary aim was to assess both the type and degree of impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child and family wellbeing in a cohort with neurodevelopmental disorders. This was a single time-point observational study utilizing a combination of surveys and standardized measures, which were administered to parents by researchers by telephone. The Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatric Clinic of the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Catania University, Italy. In total, 200 caregivers completed the questionnaires on behalf of themselves and their child. They were predominantly mothers (88.00%) and primary caregivers (93.50%), with a mean age of 42.84 years (sd = 7.13). A questionnaire featured in a previous study was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on general wellbeing, types of support, family health, home-based learning, and child behaviors. Children's diagnoses were recorded. Caregivers provided information about physical, mental, financial, and vocational wellbeing, and completed several standardised measures of mental health and well-being: the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale - K6; the General Anxiety Disorder Scale - GAD-2; and the WHO Well-being Scale - WHO-5. Overall, 58.50% of respondents agreed somewhat or strongly that their child's overall health and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic, while 47.74% felt that their own wellbeing as parents had been affected. Whilst home-based learning and disruption to services for children were noted as being significant, child wellbeing appeared to not be correlated with these but rather to restrictions, home isolation, and disruption to routine. Children with neurocognitive disorders and their families have been substantially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected that targeted resources and support services will be required in response to this increase in need.","Rizzo, Karlov, Maugeri, di Silvestre, Eapen","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S327092","20211001","GAD-2; K6; WHO-5; general wellbeing; neurocognitive","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18522,""

Mixed methods data captured measures on use, value, benefits and challenges of video consulting (VC). A total of 3561 participants provided mental health specific data. These data and its findings demonstrate that remote mental health service delivery, via the method of VC is highly satisfactory, well-accepted and clinically suitable for many patients, and provides a range of benefits to NHS patients and clinicians. Interestingly, clinicians working from 'home' rated VC more positively compared with those at their 'clinical base'. Post 1-year adoption, remote mental health services in Wales UK have demonstrated that VC is possible from both a technical and behavioural standpoint. Moving forward, we suggest clinical leaders and government support to sustain this approach 'by default' as an option for NHS appointments.","Johns, Burhouse, Tan, John, Khalil, Williams, Whistance, Ogonovsky, Ahuja","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053014","20211001","COVID-19; adult psychiatry; child &amp; adolescent psychiatry; health informatics; mental health; old age psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18524,""
"'We have been in lockdown since he was born': a mixed methods exploration of the experiences of families caring for children with intellectual disability during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","This study aimed to explore the experiences of parents caring for children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) during the UK national lockdown in spring 2020, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were identified using opportunity sampling from the IMAGINE-ID national (UK) cohort and completed an online survey followed by a semistructured interview. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Interviews were conducted over the telephone in July 2020 as the first UK lockdown was ending. 23 mothers of children with intellectual and developmental disabilities aged 5-15 years were recruited. Themes reported by parents included: managing pre-existing challenges during a time of extreme change, having mixed emotions about the benefits and difficulties that arose during the lockdown and the need for appropriate, individualised support. Our findings confirm observations previously found in UK parents of children with IDD and provide new insights on the use of technology during the pandemic for schooling and healthcare, as well as the need for regular check-ins.","Wolstencroft, Hull, Warner, Akhtar, Mandy, Skuse, Baker, Dewhurst, Lafont, Lucy Raymond, Shirley, Tilley, Timur, Titterton, Walker, Wallwork, Wicks, Ye, Erwood, Andrews, Birch, Bowen, Bradley, Challenger, Chawner, Cuthbert, Hall, Holmans, Law, Lewis, Morrison, Moss, Owen, Ray, Sopp, Tong, Bree, Coscini, Davies, Denaxas, Denyer, Fatih, Juj, Kerry, Lucock, Printzlau, Srinivasan, Walker, Watkins, Searle, Pelling, Dean, Robertson, Alan, Lucy, Procter, Berg, Lampe, Rankin, Joss, Chitty, Flinter, Holder, Kraus, Barwell, Vasudevan, Weber, Newman, Splitt, Clowes, Dijk, Harrison, Kini, Quarrell, Baralle, Mansour, Crow","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049386","20211001","COVID-19; mental health; paediatrics; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18525,""
"The impact of health education videos on general public's mental health and behavior during COVID-19","COVID-19 has seriously affected people's mental health and changed their behaviors. Previous studies for mental state and behavior promotion only targeted limited people or were not suitable for daily activity restrictions. Therefore, we decided to explore the effect of health education videos on people's mental state and health-related behaviors. Based on WeChat, QQ, and other social media, we conducted an online survey by snowball sampling. Spearman's non-parametric method was used to analyze the correlation related to mental health problemsÃ‚Â and health-related behaviors. Besides, we used binary logistic regression analyses to examine mental health problemsÃ‚Â and health-related behaviors' predictors. We performed SPSS macro PROCESS (model 4 and model 6) to analyze mediation relationships between exposure to health education videos and depression/anxiety/health-related behaviors. These models were regarded as exploratory. Binary logistic regression analyses indicated that people who watched the health education videos were more likely to wear masks (OR 1.15, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), disinfect (OR 1.26, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and take temperature (OR 1.37, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). With higher level of posttraumatic growth (PTG) or perceived social support (PSS), people had lower percentage of depression (For PSS, OR 0.98, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; For PTG, OR 0.98, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and anxiety (For PSS, OR 0.98, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001; For PTG, OR 0.98, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) and better health behaviors. The serial multiple-mediation model supported the positive indirect effects of exposure to health education videos on the depression and three health-related behaviors through PSS and PTG (Depression: B[SE]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0046 [0.0021], 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0098,Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0012; Mask-wearing: B[SE]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0051 [0.0023], 95% CI 0.0015, 0.0010; Disinfection: B[SE]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0059 [0.0024], 95% CI 0.0024, 0.0012; Temperature-taking: B[SE]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0067 [0.0026], 95% CI 0.0023, 0.0013). Exposure to health education videos can improve people's self-perceived social support and inner growth and help them cope with the adverse impact of public health emergencies with better mental health and health-related behaviors.","Yang, Wu, Xie, Xiao, Wu, Sang, Zhang, Song, Wu, Xu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-021-00211-5","20211001","COVID-19; Health education; Health-related behavior; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18526,""
"Local characterization of the COVID-19 response: the case of a lockdown in Lusaka, Zambia","The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has sparked heated debate among scholars on the relevance of lockdowns. There are those in favor of the lockdown and others who are critical of it. However, despite the increased interest in understanding the relevance of lockdowns, there still has not been much focus on its relevance in countries like Zambia. Thus, with the help of the Social Representation Theory (SRT), we set out to explore and document the local characterization of the lockdown by residents of Lusaka, Zambia. We recruited our participants through convenient and purposive sampling techniques. This was done through the use of the ZAMTEL public phone records. Initial contact was made to potential participants, and they were asked of their availability and willingness to participate in the interview. Upon agreeing to participate, they were included in the sample. A total of 68 people were selected to take part in this study. Their age ranged from 20 to 76 years old. 33 of them were male and 35 females. After this, we conducted interviews with the 68 participants. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, our interviews were conducted via telephone in conformity with the recommendations from the IRB in Lusaka and the advice of the ministry of health. We anonymized the demographic characteristics and responses from our participants. Later, thematic analysis was used to analyze the data. The lockdown was on one hand lauded for slowing down the incidence rates, preventing fatalities, and protecting the healthcare system from collapse. On the other hand, it was criticized for exacerbating poverty levels, unemployment rates, increasing the rate of mental health problems, aiding gender-based violence, and intensifying political repression and corruption. The results speak to the complexity in the characterization of the lockdown as a response to COVID-19 in Lusaka, Zambia. This observation demonstrates the folly of viewing, applying and characterizing the COVID-19 lockdown as a 'one-size-fits-all' approach in Lusaka, Zambia. Rather than establishing the lockdown as an incontestable good, as it is depicted by some scholars or as useless by its critics, our findings instead demonstrate the diversity and complexity in how it is locally viewed by Lusaka residents. The study provides grounds for caution on simplistic and binary characterization of lockdowns. It indicates the need for careful dialog between the designers of lockdowns and citizens in order to tailor such interventions to local realities in context-specific ways. It also shows that though the development of such interventions, all the various and complex elements it embodies must be taken into account in order to realize optimum outcomes.","Muzyamba","https://doi.org/10.1186/s41256-021-00220-4","20211001","COVID-19; Lockdown; Zambia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18527,""
"Redefining communities: The association between deferred action, online and offline social capital and depressive symptoms among undocumented young adults","An explosion in Internet use, social networking sites, and COVID-19 has promoted a new concept in health â€“ online social capital, defined as linkages to online social networks that promote trust and group norms. Particularly for the 1.3 million undocumented young adult immigrants who â€œlive in the shadows,â€ the Internet may serve as a place of support and information. This study examines the association between documentation status (defined as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status), offline social capital, online social capital, and depressive symptoms among foreign-born Latino and Asian and Pacific Islander young adults in California (N = 208) using data from an internet-based survey conducted in 2017. This study found that those without DACA status had higher online social capital (p < 0.001) and increased depressive symptoms (p = 0.01) than those with DACA status. Using linear regression, we found evidence of online social capital potentially mediating the relationship between DACA status and depressive symptoms. This study also found that as offline social capital increases, the association between online social capital on depressive symptoms decreases. This study points to the power of offline communities and the importance of increasing access to community resources, particularly to those without documentation status who may only have online social networks.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2021.101563","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18528,""

"Impact of a pilot elective course to address student pharmacist well-being","Introduction Survey results from 2016 and 2018 at the University of Michigan College of Pharmacy highlighted mental health concerns for the student population, including struggles with depression, anxiety, and academic distress. This led to creation of a pilot well-being elective course for first year doctor of pharmacy students. This article describes how this course was assessed and adapted for the future. Methods The well-being elective course used a course-specific survey and the Brief Inventory of Thriving to assess student outcomes. The course-specific survey was based upon the course objectives and the University of Michigan Common Agenda for Well-Being. Both surveys were given pre- and post-course to identify change. Results Course survey results illustrated an improvement in student well-being over a single semester. Compared with pre-course responses, students who completed the course were significantly more likely to agree with statements indicating they had strong time management skills, resilience to manage the fluctuations of life, were able to make thoughtful choices to reduce harm and promote well-being, and overall rated their well-being as excellent. Additionally, nearly all students felt a sense of strengthened community with peers and faculty within the course, better able to recognize or refer a peer for help, and felt the course contributed to their overall well-being. Conclusions Implementation of this well-being elective pilot course provided students the tools and resources to improve upon their overall well-being in an effort to address anxiety, depression, and academic distress.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.09.007","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-02","",18535,""
