"Child Suicide Rates During the COVID-19 pandemic in England","Background: There is concern about the impact of COVID-19, and the control measures to prevent the spread, on children's mental health. The aim of this work was to identify if there had been a rise of childhood suicide during the COVID pandemic; using data from England's National Child Mortality Database (NCMD). Method: Child suicide rates between April to December 2020 were compared with those in 2019 using negative binomial regression models, and characteristics compared. In a subset (1st January to 17th May 2020) further characteristics and possible contributing factors were obtained. Results: A total of 193 likely childhood deaths by suicide were reported. There was no evidence overall suicide deaths were higher in 2020 than 2019 (RR 1.09 (0.80-1.48), p=0.584) but weak evidence that the rate in the first lockdown period (April to May 2020) was higher than the corresponding period in 2019 (RR 1.56 (0.86-2.81), p=0.144). Characteristics of individuals were similar between periods. Restriction to education and other activities, disruption to care and support services, tensions at home and isolation appeared to be contributing factors. Limitations: As child suicides are fortunately rare, the analysis is based on small numbers of deaths with limited statistical power to detect anything but major increases in incidence. Conclusion: We found no consistent evidence that child suicide deaths increased during the COVID-19 pandemic although there was a concerning signal they may have increased during the first UK lockdown. A similar peak was not seen during the following months, or the second lockdown.","David E Odd; Tom Williams; Louis Appleby; David Gunnell; Karen Luyt","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.13.21260366","20210715","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15979,""
"Mental Health Effects of COVID-19 Within the Socioeconomic Crisis and After the Beirut Blast Among Health Care Workers and Medical Students in Lebanon","<b><i>Objective:</i></b> To measure the mental health effects (perceived stress, anxiety, and depression) among health care workers and medical students in Lebanon during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and subsequent to the Beirut blast. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> In this cross-sectional study, a self-administered online questionnaire was developed and distributed between late December 2020 and early February 2021 among health care workers and medical students via social media. The 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) and the 4-item Patient Health Questionnaire for Depression and Anxiety (PHQ-4) were administered. <i>P</i> values between variables were calculated using Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> test. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Overall, 98% of the respondents had a low PSS-10 score and 89% had a low PHQ-4 score. About 58.1% of health care workers and 69.0% of student respondents had moderate to severe stress on the PSS-10, and 48.7% and 46.8%, respectively, reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression on the PHQ-4. Prevalence of depression and anxiety was relatively higher among health care workers with monthly incomes &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°LBP 4 million (57.1%) and higher in women (39.9%) compared to men (17.2%). Furthermore, the prevalence of depression and anxiety was higher among health care workers traveling between different districts (63.0%) compared to those with residence and work location within the same district and was higher among females (65.4%) compared to males (34.6%). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> The resilience of the Lebanese people as well as their ability to adapt in the face of trauma, tragedy, threats, or any significant source of stress is remarkable and seen in their everyday lives, especially subsequent to the Beirut blast. However, the psychological well-being and mental health of health care workers and medical students in Lebanon should be carefully surveilled and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially within the ongoing socioeconomic crisis.","Abed, Razzak, Hashim","https://doi.org/10.4088/PCC.21m02977","20210715","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15980,""
"Validation of the Japanese version of Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics-9 (SAVE-9) and relationship among stress, insomnia, anxiety, and depression in healthcare workers exposed to coronavirus disease 2019","This study aimed to validate the Japanese version of the 9-item Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics scale (SAVE-9) and the relationships among the stress related to viral epidemics, insomnia, anxiety, and depression. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted online. In total, 1000 healthcare workers (579 men, 421 women; mean age: 43.11Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 11.69 years) were asked to complete the SAVE-9, Athens Insomnia Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, and Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. For the analysis, participants were divided into two groups: healthcare workers at a medical institution designated for COVID-19 (COVID institution) and those working at an institution not designated for COVID-19 (non-COVID institution). Item response theory analysis showed that the SAVE-9 and SAVE-6 (6-item version) had good structural validity and internal consistency (Ãâ€°Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.91 and 0.93). Correlation analysis for convergent validity showed a significant positive correlation between both the SAVE-9 and SAVE-6 and the other scales for insomnia, anxiety, and depression. In addition, both SAVE-9 and SAVE-6 scores were higher for workers in COVID institutions than for those in non-COVID institutions. Furthermore, stress related to viral epidemics was found to directly affect anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.48) and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.25) and indirectly affect anxiety (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.37) and depression (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.54) via insomnia (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.33). This study confirmed that the reliability and validity of both the SAVE-9 and SAVE-6 and that insomnia mediated the effects of stress to viral epidemics on anxiety and depression symptoms.","Okajima, Chung, Suh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sleep.2021.06.035","20210715","Anxiety; COVID-19; Cross-sectional survey; Depression; Insomnia; Stress and Anxiety to Viral Epidemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15981,""
"N-acylethanolamine regulation of TLR3-induced hyperthermia and neuroinflammatory gene expression: A role for PPARÃŽÂ±","Increasing evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is associated with increased risk of developing neurological or psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety or dementia. While the precise mechanism underlying this association is unknown, aberrant activation of toll-like receptor (TLR)3, a viral recognizing pattern recognition receptor, may play a key role. Synthetic cannabinoids and enhancing cannabinoid tone via inhibition of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) has been demonstrated to modulate TLR3-induced neuroimmune responses and associated sickness behaviour. However, the role of individual FAAH substrates, and the receptor mechanisms mediating these effects, are unknown. The present study examined the effects of intracerebral or systemic administration of the FAAH substrates N-oleoylethanolamide (OEA), N-palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) or the anandamide (AEA) analogue meth-AEA on hyperthermia and hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression following administration of the TLR3 agonist, and viral mimetic, poly I:C. The data demonstrate that meth-AEA does not alter TLR3-induced hyperthermia or hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression. In comparison, OEA and PEA attenuated the TLR3-induced hyperthermia, although only OEA attenuated the expression of hyperthermia-related genes (IL-1ÃŽÂ², iNOS, COX2 and m-PGES) in the hypothalamus. OEA, but not PEA, attenuated TLR3-induced increases in the expression of all IRF- and NFÃŽÂºB-related genes examined in the hypothalamus, but not in the spleen. Antagonism of PPARÃŽÂ± prevented the OEA-induced attenuation of IRF- and NFÃŽÂºB-related genes in the hypothalamus following TLR3 activation but did not significantly alter temperature. PPARÃŽÂ± agonism did not alter TLR3-induced hyperthermia or hypothalamic inflammatory gene expression. These data indicate that OEA may be the primary FAAH substrate that modulates TLR3-induced neuroinflammation and hyperthermia, effects partially mediated by PPARÃŽÂ±.","Flannery, Kerr, Hughes, Kelly, Costello, Thornton, Humphrey, Finn, Roche","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneuroim.2021.577654","20210715","Anandamide; Cannabinoid; Hypothalamus; Neuroinflammation; OEA; PEA; PPAR; Temperature; Viral infection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15982,""
"Media use before, during and after COVID-19 lockdown according to parents in a clinically referred sample in child and adolescent psychiatry: Results of an online survey in Switzerland","To investigate the consequences of COVID-19 lockdown on screen media use in children and adolescents with mental health problems, an online survey was conducted on leisure media use before, during and after the lockdown of spring 2020. Parents of patients (10-18Ã‚Â yrs) referred to child and adolescent psychiatry participated in an anonymous online survey, approximately six weeks after the first easing of lockdown measures. Parents rated the amount, the content and the psychological impact of their children's media use before, during and after the lockdown. NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 477 parents completed the survey. Patients showed a significant increase in media time during the lockdown (including devices such as mobile, tablet/PC, video game console, TV, and activities such as gaming, social media) and a moderate increase in the negative impact of media use on everyday life. After the lockdown, total media time returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in most patients, but remained slightly higher in males. A worsening of the main psychopathological problem during lockdown was related to elevated media time in children (10-13Ã‚Â yrs), but not in adolescents (14-18Ã‚Â yrs). According to parents' retrospective ratings, the increase in screen media time was reversible, and seems to reflect an expected coping strategy during lockdown. However, male patients did not completely return to pre-COVID-19 gaming time, and a small number continued to display excessive gaming.","Werling, Walitza, GrÃƒÂ¼nblatt, Drechsler","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152260","20210715","COVID-19; Child and adolescent psychiatry; Lockdown; Pandemic; Problematic use of the internet; Screen media use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15983,""
"Symptoms, complications and management of long COVID: a review","Globally, there are now over 160 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 3 million deaths. While the majority of infected individuals recover, a significant proportion continue to experience symptoms and complications after their acute illness. Patients with 'long COVID' experience a wide range of physical and mental/psychological symptoms. Pooled prevalence data showed the 10 most prevalent reported symptoms were fatigue, shortness of breath, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, cough, chest pain, altered smell, altered taste and diarrhoea. Other common symptoms were cognitive impairment, memory loss, anxiety and sleep disorders. Beyond symptoms and complications, people with long COVID often reported impaired quality of life, mental health and employment issues. These individuals may require multidisciplinary care involving the long-term monitoring of symptoms, to identify potential complications, physical rehabilitation, mental health and social services support.

"Jealousy and Electronic Intrusion Mediated by Relationship Uncertainty in Married and Cohabiting Couples During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic poses unique threats to romantic relationships as couples were issued to stay at home by a mandatory order, limiting social interactions with others. Although technology allows for social interactions, the privacy of interactions through technology may be compromised. Electronic intrusion (EI) occurs when individuals covertly gain access of their partner's mobile device to go through content (e.g., text messages, private messages on social media sites), and previous study indicates serious consequences of EI, including increased rates of intimate partner violence, depressive symptoms, and heavy episodic drinking. This study examines jealousy, relationship uncertainty (RU), and EI in a sample of American adults. We hypothesized that jealousy would be related to greater acts of EI, and that this association will be mediated by RU. Data were collected from 754 Qualtrics Panels participants (50 percent male) with an average age of 41.7 years. Most participants (85.7 percent) were married. Results supported hypotheses, demonstrating that jealousy was associated with more EI, and this was due to uncertainty about the relationship's future. This study illuminates a need to study cyberdating abuse (CDA) in older and married populations. Future research should consider the effects of other relationship-specific emotions and cognitions on EI and further develop strategies aimed at reducing risks for CDA in romantic relationships.","Ligman, Rodriguez, Rocek","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0669","20210715","couples; cyberdating abuse; pandemic; smartphones; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15985,""
"A mindfulness-based mobile health (mHealth) intervention among psychologically distressed university students in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic: A randomized controlled trial","This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of a mindfulness-based mobile health (mHealth) intervention, tailored to the pandemic context, among young adult students (N = 114) with elevated anxiety and/or depressive symptoms during quarantine in China, compared to a time- and attention-matched social support-based mHealth control. At baseline, postintervention (1 month), and 2-month follow-up, participants completed self-reports of primary outcomes (anxiety and depression), secondary outcomes (mindfulness and social support), and emotional suppression as a culturally relevant mechanism of change. Feasibility and acceptability were also evaluated. Using intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, linear mixed effects models showed that compared to social support mHealth, mindfulness mHealth had a superior effect on anxiety (p = .024, between-group d = 0.72). Both conditions improved on depression (baseline-to-FU ds &gt; 1.10, between-group difference not significant, d = 0.36 favoring mindfulness). There was an interaction of Emotional suppression reduction Ãƒâ€” Condition in the improvement of anxiety and depression. Further, mindfulness mHealth was demonstrated to be more feasible and acceptable in program engagement, evaluation, skills improvement, and perceived benefit. Retention was high in both conditions (&gt;80%). The difference in self-reported adverse effect was nonsignificant (3.9% in mindfulness and 8.7% in social support). Results of this pilot trial suggest that both mindfulness and social support, delivered via mHealth, show promise in reducing distress among young adults in quarantine, with mindfulness being particularly effective in addressing anxiety. Successful implementation and dissemination of this mHealth intervention approach have the potential for addressing the psychological consequences of the pandemic.

Of participants 36.9% scored 'bad' for both overall and ED related QoL. In the stepwise regression analysis depression score had the highest predictive value for ED behaviour. Almost half of the participants felt an improvement in their ED and a majority reported rare parental conflict. However, less than half reported meal plan compliance. As depression had the highest positive predictive value for ED behaviour additional screening for depression during the pandemic maybe warranted in ED patients.","AkgÃƒÂ¼l, Akdemir, Nalbant, Derman, ErsÃƒÂ¶z Alan, TÃƒÂ¼zÃƒÂ¼n, Kanbur","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13193","20210715","COVID-19; adolescent; eating disorder; lockdown; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15989,""

"Weathering the storm: A qualitative study of social prescribing in urban and rural Scotland during the COVID-19 pandemic","The non-clinical approach known as social prescribing aims to tackle multi-morbidity, reduce general practitioner (GP) workload and promote wellbeing by directing patients to community services. Usual in-person modes of delivery of social prescribing have been virtually impossible under social distancing rules. This study qualitatively examined and compared the responses of three social prescribing schemes in Scotland to the COVID-19 pandemic. We interviewed a theoretical sample of 23 stakeholders in urban and rural social prescribing schemes at the start of COVID-19 pandemic. Follow-up interviews with a representative sample were conducted around 10 months later. Interviewees included social prescribing coordinators (SPCs) GPs, managers, researchers and representatives of third sector organizations. Interview transcripts were analysed in stages and an inductive approach to coding was supported by NVivo. Findings revealed a complex social prescribing landscape in Scotland with schemes funded, structured and delivering services in diverse ways. Across all schemes, working effectively during the pandemic and shifting to online delivery had been challenging and demanding; however, their priorities in response to the pandemic had differed. With GP time and services stretched to limits, GP practice-attached 'Link Workers' had taken on counselling and advocacy roles, sometimes for serious mental health cases. Community-based SPCs had mostly assumed a health education role, and those on the Western Isles of Scotland a digital support role. In both rural or urban areas, combatting loneliness and isolation - especially given social distancing - remained a pivotal aspect of the SPC role. This study highlights significant challenges and shifts in focus in social prescribing in response to the pandemic. The use of multiple digital technologies has assumed a central role in social prescribing, and this situation seems likely to remain. With statutory and non-statutory services stretched to their limits, there is a danger of SPCs assuming new tasks without adequate training or support.","Fixsen, Barrett, Shimonovich","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211029187","20210715","COVID-19; Social prescribing; community services; qualitative studies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15992,""

The pooled prevalence of depression was 27% (95% confidence interval: 9%-45%), with remarkable heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°99.29%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Likewise, the pooled prevalence of stress was 56% (95% confidence interval: 30.07%-82.22%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°98.8%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). The pooled prevalence of social dysfunction was 24.3% (95% confidence interval: 13.41%-62.03%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°97.5%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001) and finally, the pooled prevalence of insomnia was 33.53% (95% confidence interval: 3.05%-64.0%), with significant heterogeneity between studies (I<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°99.6%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001). In this study, the mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among pregnant and lactating women were found to be significant. Stress was the most common mental health problem in these population groups. Therefore, policymakers and health planners should give great emphasis to addressing maternal mental well-being during and after this global health crisis. Maternal mental health must be one of the international and national public health priority agendas to enhance the well-being of pregnant and lactating women. Besides, giving psychological support to pregnant and lactating women may reduce the long-term negative effects of this pandemic.","Demissie, Bitew","https://doi.org/10.1177/20503121211026195","20210715","Coronavirus disease 2019; Mental health; anxiety; depression; insomnia; lactating women; pregnant; social dysfunctions; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15993,""
"Mental health responses to COVID-19 around the world","<b>Background</b>: The mental health impact of the COVID-19 crisis may differ from previously studied stressful events in terms of psychological reactions, specific risk factors, and symptom severity across geographic regions worldwide. <b>Objective</b>: To assess the impact of COVID-19 on a wide range of mental health symptoms, to identify relevant risk factors, to identify the effect of COVID-19 country impact on mental health, and to evaluate regional differences in psychological responses to COVID-19 compared to other stressful events. <b>Method</b>: 7034 respondents (74% female) participated in the worldwide <i>Global Psychotrauma Screen - Cross-Cultural responses to COVID-19 study (GPS-CCC</i>), reporting on mental health symptoms related to COVID-19 (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 1838) or other stressful events (<i>n</i> =Ã‚Â 5196) from April to November 2020. <b>Results</b>: Events related to COVID-19 were associated with more mental health symptoms compared to other stressful events, especially symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and dissociation. Lack of social support, psychiatric history, childhood trauma, additional stressful events in the past month, and low resilience predicted more mental health problems for COVID-19 and other stressful events. Higher COVID-19 country impact was associated with increased mental health impact of both COVID-19 and other stressful events. Analysis of differences across geographic regions revealed that in Latin America more mental health symptoms were reported for COVID-19 related events versus other stressful events, while the opposite pattern was seen in North America. <b>Conclusions</b>: The mental health impact of COVID-19-related stressors covers a wide range of symptoms and is more severe than that of other stressful events. This difference was especially apparent in Latin America. The findings underscore the need for global screening for a wide range of mental health problems as part of a public health approach, allowing for targeted prevention and intervention programs. <b>Antecedentes</b>: El impacto de la crisis por la COVID-19 sobre la salud mental podrÃƒÂ­a diferir de otros eventos estresantes estudiados con anterioridad en relaciÃƒÂ³n con reacciones psicolÃƒÂ³gicas, factores de riesgo especÃƒÂ­ficos y severidad de sÃƒÂ­ntomas en diferentes regiones geogrÃƒÂ¡ficas alrededor del mundo.<b>Objetivo</b>: Evaluar el impacto de la COVID-19 sobre una amplia variedad de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental, identificar los factores de riesgo relevantes, identificar el efecto que el impacto de la COVID-19 sobre un paÃƒÂ­s ejerce, a su vez, sobre la salud mental, y evaluar las diferencias regionales en las respuestas psicolÃƒÂ³gicas a la COVID-19 comparadas con otros eventos estresantes.<b>MÃƒÂ©todo</b>: 7034 encuestados (74 % mujeres) participaron en <i>el Mapeo Global de Psicotrauma Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Estudio de Respuestas Transculturales frente a la COVID-19</i>(GPSÃ¢â‚¬â€œCCC, por sus siglas en ingles), reportando sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental relacionados a la COVID-19 (n = 1838) u otros eventos estresantes (n = 5196) de abril a noviembre del 2020.<b>Resultados</b>: Los eventos relacionados a la COVID-19 se asociaron con un mayor nÃƒÂºmero de sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental comparados con otros eventos estresantes, especialmente con sÃƒÂ­ntomas del trastorno de estrÃƒÂ©s postraumÃƒÂ¡tico, ansiedad, depresiÃƒÂ³n, insomnio, y disociaciÃƒÂ³n. La falta de apoyo social, los antecedentes psiquiÃƒÂ¡tricos, el trauma infantil, los eventos estresantes adicionales ocurridos en el ÃƒÂºltimo mes y una baja resiliencia predijeron tener mayores problemas de salud mental por la COVID-19 y otros eventos estresantes. Un impacto mÃƒÂ¡s alto ejercido por la COVID-19 sobre un paÃƒÂ­s se asociÃƒÂ³, a su vez, con un mayor impacto sobre la salud mental, tanto por la COVID-19 como por otros eventos estresantes. Un anÃƒÂ¡lisis de las diferencias entre regiones geogrÃƒÂ¡ficas revelÃƒÂ³ que en LatinoamÃƒÂ©rica se reportaron mÃƒÂ¡s sÃƒÂ­ntomas de salud mental asociados a eventos relacionados con la COVID-19 en comparaciÃƒÂ³n con otros eventos estresantes, mientras que se observÃƒÂ³ un patrÃƒÂ³n opuesto en AmÃƒÂ©rica del Norte.<b>Conclusiones</b>: El impacto de los estresores asociados a la COVID-19 sobre la salud mental abarca un amplio rango de sÃƒÂ­ntomas y es mÃƒÂ¡s severo que otros eventos estresantes. Esta diferencia fue especialmente evidente en LatinoamÃƒÂ©rica. Estos hallazgos enfatizan la necesidad de un tamizaje global para detectar una amplia gama de problemas de salud mental como parte de un enfoque de salud pÃƒÂºblica, permitiendo programas especÃƒÂ­ficos de prevenciÃƒÂ³n e intervenciÃƒÂ³n. <b>Ã¨Æ’Å’Ã¦â„¢Â¯</b>: Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã¥Ââ€žÃ¥Å“Â°, COVID-19Ã¥ÂÂ±Ã¦Å“ÂºÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¥ÂÂ¯Ã¨Æ’Â½Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥â€¦Ë†Ã¥â€°ÂÃ§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶, Ã§â€°Â¹Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â Ã¥â€™Å’Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ§Â¨â€¹Ã¥ÂºÂ¦Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã¦Å“â€°Ã¦â€°â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ¥ÂÅ’Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§â€ºÂ®Ã§Å¡â€ž</b>: Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°COVID-19Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦Â³â€ºÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã©Â£Å½Ã©â„¢Â©Ã¥â€ºÂ Ã§Â´Â , Ã§Â¡Â®Ã¥Â®Å¡COVID-19Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂ, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¨Â¯â€žÃ¤Â¼Â°Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¥Â¯Â¹COVID-19Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢</b>: 7034Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Ââ€”Ã¨Â®Â¿Ã¨â‚¬â€¦ (74Ã¯Â¼â€¦Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥Â¥Â³Ã¦â‚¬Â§) Ã¥Å“Â¨2020Ã¥Â¹Â´4Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¨â€¡Â³11Ã¦Å“Ë†Ã¦Å“Å¸Ã©â€”Â´Ã¥Ââ€šÃ¥Å Â Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â€“Ã§â€¢Å’Ã¨Å’Æ’Ã¥â€ºÂ´Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¢â‚¬ËœÃ¥â€¦Â¨Ã§ÂÆ’Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤Ã§Â­â€ºÃ¦Å¸Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬â€Ã¥Â¯Â¹COVID-19Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¨Â·Â¨Ã¦â€“â€¡Ã¥Å’â€“Ã¥ÂÂÃ¥Âºâ€Ã§Â â€Ã§Â©Â¶ (GPS-CCC), Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Âºâ€ COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³ (n = 1838) Ã¦Ë†â€“Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³ (n = 5196) Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“</b>: Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¨Â¾Æ’Ã¤ÂºÅ½Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶, COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¤Â¸Å½Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³, Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¦ËœÂ¯PTSD, Ã§â€žÂ¦Ã¨â„¢â€˜, Ã¦Å â€˜Ã©Æ’Â, Ã¥Â¤Â±Ã§Å“Â Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¨Â§Â£Ã§Â¦Â»Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â¼ÂºÃ¤Â¹ÂÃ§Â¤Â¾Ã¤Â¼Å¡Ã¦â€Â¯Ã¦Å’Â, Ã§Â²Â¾Ã§Â¥Å¾Ã§â€”â€¦Ã¥ÂÂ², Ã§Â«Â¥Ã¥Â¹Â´Ã¥Ë†â€ºÃ¤Â¼Â¤, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¨Â¿â€¡Ã¥Å½Â»Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã¤Â¸ÂªÃ¦Å“Ë†Ã¤Â¸Â­Ã¥â€¡ÂºÃ§Å½Â°Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶, Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¤Â½Å½Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã©Å¸Â§Ã¦â‚¬Â§, Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¦Âµâ€¹Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡COVID-19Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã©Â«ËœÃ§Å¡â€ž COVID-19Ã¥â€ºÂ½Ã¥Â®Â¶Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¤Â¸Å½COVID-19Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Â§Ã¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ©Æ’Â½Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â·Â¨Ã¥Å“Â°Ã¥Å’ÂºÃ§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Ë†â€ Ã¦Å¾ÂÃ¨Â¡Â¨Ã¦ËœÅ½, Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€¹â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¾Å½Ã¦Â´Â²Ã¦Å Â¥Ã¥â€˜Å Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¥Â¤Å¡Ã§Å¡â€žCOVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶, Ã¨â‚¬Å’Ã¥Å“Â¨Ã¥Å’â€”Ã§Â¾Å½Ã¥Ë†â„¢Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥ÂÂÃ£â‚¬â€š<b>Ã§Â»â€œÃ¨Â®Âº</b>: COVID-19Ã§â€ºÂ¸Ã¥â€¦Â³Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¦ÂºÂÃ¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã§Å¡â€žÃ¥Â½Â±Ã¥â€œÂÃ¦Â¶ÂµÃ§â€ºâ€“Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã§Â³Â»Ã¥Ë†â€”Ã¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦Â³â€ºÃ§â€”â€¡Ã§Å Â¶, Ã¥Â¹Â¶Ã¤Â¸â€Ã¦Â¯â€Ã¥â€¦Â¶Ã¤Â»â€“Ã¥Å½â€¹Ã¥Å â€ºÃ¤Âºâ€¹Ã¤Â»Â¶Ã¦â€ºÂ´Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¤Â¸Â¥Ã©â€¡ÂÃ£â‚¬â€šÃ¨Â¿â„¢Ã§Â§ÂÃ¥Â·Â®Ã¥Â¼â€šÃ¥Å“Â¨Ã¦â€¹â€°Ã¤Â¸ÂÃ§Â¾Å½Ã¦Â´Â²Ã¥Â°Â¤Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¦ËœÅ½Ã¦ËœÂ¾Ã£â‚¬â€šÃ§Â»â€œÃ¦Å¾Å“Ã¥Â¼ÂºÃ¨Â°Æ’Ã¤Âºâ€ Ã¨â‚¬Æ’Ã¨â„¢â€˜Ã¥Ë†Â°Ã©â€™Ë†Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¦â‚¬Â§Ã©Â¢â€žÃ©ËœÂ²Ã¥â€™Å’Ã¥Â¹Â²Ã©Â¢â€žÃ¨Â®Â¡Ã¥Ë†â€™, Ã©Å“â‚¬Ã¨Â¦ÂÃ¦Å Å Ã¥Â¯Â¹Ã¥Â¹Â¿Ã¦Â³â€ºÃ¥Â¿Æ’Ã§Ââ€ Ã¥ÂÂ¥Ã¥ÂºÂ·Ã©â€”Â®Ã©Â¢ËœÃ¨Â¿â€ºÃ¨Â¡Å’Ã¥â€¦Â¨Ã§ÂÆ’Ã§Â­â€ºÃ¦Å¸Â¥Ã¤Â½Å“Ã¤Â¸ÂºÃ¥â€¦Â¬Ã¥â€¦Â±Ã¥ÂÂ«Ã§â€Å¸Ã¦â€“Â¹Ã¦Â³â€¢Ã¤Â¸â‚¬Ã©Æ’Â¨Ã¥Ë†â€ Ã£â‚¬â€š.","Olff, Primasari, Qing, Coimbra, Hovnanyan, Grace, Williamson, Hoeboer, Consortium","https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2021.1929754","20210715","COVID-19; PTSD; anxiety; depression; dissociation; global mental health; insomnia; public health; risk factors; screening","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15994,""
"Case Report: Systemic Sclerosis After Covid-19 Infection","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a respiratory tract infection caused by the new virus SARS-CoV-2. The acute phase of the infection may in certain individuals be followed by another longer phase of disease (long COVID) of unknown etiology probably associated in certain cases with autoimmune activation. It has been shown that COVID-19 can trigger autoantibody production and in genetically predisposed patients may cause the onset or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases. We are reporting a case of mild COVID-19 infection complicated by autoantibody production and cutaneous and gastrointestinal symptoms and subsequently diagnosed with systemic sclerosis (SSc). A 47-year-old man with no history of any autoimmune diseases and in good health became sick together with his family on the 12th of November with mild symptoms: tiredness, fever, cough, and sore throat. Oropharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 tested positive. He was isolated at home and did not require hospitalization. Three weeks later he presented with clinical manifestation compatible with suspicion of SSc. He briefly presented with skin rush, periorbital edema and conjunctivitis, vomiting, dysphagia, burning sensation in the skin, above all in the fingertips and around the mouth, puffy fingers, Raynaud's phenomenon, pain at the fingertip of the middle finger where a depressed area was noticed without a clear ulceration. ANA showed a strongly positive nucleolar pattern. Anti-PM/Scl 75 and PM/Scl 100 resulted positive. High-resolution computed tomography (HCRT) showed early stage of interstitial lung disease (ILD). The patient was diagnosed with SSc based on the persistence of autoantibodies and the clinical and radiological pictures according to the ACR/EULAR classification (scores: puffy finger, 2; ILD, 2; Raynaud's phenomenon, 3; SSc related antibodies, 3; total 10). There are several cases described in the medical literature of possible new onset of SLE after COVID-19 infection. This is the first case that describes a possible new onset of SSc. Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 may trigger systemic sclerosis.","Fineschi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.686699","20210715","COVID-19; autoimmunity; long COVID; scleroderma; systemic sclerosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15995,""
"Engagement in Music-Related Activities During the COVID-19 Pandemic as a Mirror of Individual Differences in Musical Reward and Coping Strategies","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its impact (e.g., confinement orders) have affected people's lives in profound ways that would have been unimagable only months before the pandemic began. Media reports from the height of the pandemic's initial international surge frequently highlighted that many people were engaging in music-related activities (from singing and dancing to playing music from balconies and attending virtual concerts) to help them cope with the strain of the pandemic. Our first goal in this study was to investigate changes in music-related habits due to the pandemic. We also investigated whether engagement in distinct music-related activities (singing, listening, dancing, etc.) was associated with individual differences in musical reward, music perception, musical training, or emotional regulation strategies. To do so, we collected detailed (~1 h-long) surveys during the initial peak of shelter-in-place order implementation (May-June 2020) from over a thousand individuals across different Countries in which the pandemic was especially devastating at that time: the USA, Spain, and Italy. Our findings indicate that, on average, people spent more time in music-related activities while under confinement than they had before the pandemic. Notably, this change in behavior was dependent on individual differences in music reward sensitivity, and in emotional regulation strategies. Finally, the type of musical activity with which individuals engaged was further associated with the degree to which they used music as a way to regulate stress, to address the lack of social interaction (especially the individuals more concerned about the risk of contracting the virus), or to cheer themselves up (especially those who were more worried about the pandemic consequences). Identifying which music-related activities have been particularly sought for by the population as a means for coping with such heightened uncertainty and stress, and understanding the individual differences that underlie said propensities are crucial to implementing personalized music-based interventions that aim to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms.","Ferreri, Singer, McPhee, RipollÃƒÂ©s, Zatorre, Mas-Herrero","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673772","20210715","COVID-19; emotional regulation; individual differences; music; music reward; musical abilities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15996,""
"Extra-Curricular Activities and Well-Being: Results From a Survey of Undergraduate University Students During COVID-19 Lockdown Restrictions","Participation in extra-curricular activities has been found to associate with increased well-being. Here we investigated in a survey (<i>n</i> = 786) what activities university students at a Canadian university engaged in during the stressful COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in April, 2020, which coincided with a novel online exam period, and how these activities related to perceived well-being, anxiety (STAI-S), social aspects of activities, and personality. Sixty-five percentage of students scored in the high anxiety category of the STAI-S, an alarming statistic given that only 24% had reached out for professional supports. This is consistent with reports that current supports on university campuses are inadequate. Listening to music (92%) and watching movies/series (92%) were engaged in most frequently, followed by socializing virtually (89%) and engaging in social media (85%). The activities students rated as most helpful to their well-being were somewhat different, with outdoor exercise rated highest, followed by socializing virtually and listening to music. While all activities were rated as beneficial, those with a social component tended to have high ratings, consistent with students attempting to replace lost social interactions. Linear regression models found few associations between STAI-S scores and other measures, likely because of large individual differences and lack of a pre-pandemic baseline needed to assess changes in anxiety. The importance of individual differences was evident in that those higher in <i>conscientiousness</i> or <i>extraversion</i> or <i>emotional stability</i> were more likely to engage in exercise, while those higher in <i>openness to experience</i> were more likely to engage in journaling, playing a musical instrument, or singing, with a trend for higher engagement in song writing. Individual differences were also evident in that equal numbers of students gave positive and negative comments related to their well-being during the pandemic. The individual differences uncovered here suggest that having a variety of proactive interventions would likely reach more students. Indeed, 52% indicated an interest in online group music therapy, 48% in art therapy and 40% in verbal therapy, despite music and art therapies being virtually non-existent on campuses. In sum, the findings highlight the importance of choice in extra-curricular activities and therapies that support well-being.","Finnerty, Marshall, Imbault, Trainor","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.647402","20210715","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; extra-curricular activities; mental health; music; stress; undergraduate students; wellness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15997,""
"Fatalism in the Early Days of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for Mitigation and Mental Health","This research assessed fatalism toward COVID-19 and its role in behavioral intentions to support mitigation efforts (e. g., social distancing) and mental well-being. A COVID-19 fatalism measure was developed, and a messaging manipulation (fatalistic vs. optimistic vs. no message) was created to examine causal links between fatalism scores. Support for mitigation efforts and negative affect (anxiety, fear, depression, and insecurity) were measured to examine the consequences of fatalism toward COVID-19. Results showed that the fatalistic messaging condition increased fatalism whereas the optimistic message reduced it. The effects of the messaging manipulation were also apparent in the downstream measures of support for mitigation and negative affect through the mediator of fatalism toward COVID-19. Specifically, fatalism negatively predicted intentions to support mitigation. Regarding mental health, fatalism was positively associated with depression but negatively associated with fear and insecurity. Implications for COVID-19 mitigation efforts and mental health in the face of the coronavirus pandemic are discussed.","Hayes, Clerk","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.560092","20210715","COVID-19; fatalism; media messaging; mental health; social distancing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",15998,""
"The Association of Suicidal Ideation With Family Characteristics and Social Support of the First Batch of Students Returning to a College During the COVID-19 Epidemic Period: A Cross Sectional Study in China","<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the prevalence of suicidal ideation among the first batch of students returning to a college during the COVID-19 epidemic, and to explore the correlation of suicidal ideation with family characteristics and social support. <b>Methods:</b> A cluster sampling survey with a self-designed questionnaire was conducted among the first batch of students returning to a college in Wuhu, China. The Positive and Negative Suicidal ideation (PANSI) and Social Support Scale (SSRS) were used to define students' suicidal ideation and social support, respectively. The influence of family characteristics and social support on the students' suicidal ideation was investigated using multivariate unconditional logistic regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> Two thousand seven hundred valid questionnaires were collected, including 673 males (24.9%) and 2,027 females (75.1%), in this study. A total of 146 students (5.4%) showed suicidal ideation. Male respondents reported higher rates (7.9%) than females (4.6%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a higher risk level of residence before returning to school and lower objective support were the risk factors for suicidal ideation in males. In contrast, a higher level of maternal education, a poorer relationship with the mother, and lower scores for subjective support and support availability had significant effects on females' suicidal ideation. <b>Limitations:</b> This is a cross-sectional study, and lacks comparison to the time point unaffected by COVID-19. Moreover, it was limited by COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control restrictions, and the differences in returning to school in different regions. Only one college was investigated in this study, and all of the respondents were sophomores, so there may be some limitations in the representativeness of the sample and extrapolation of the results. <b>Conclusion:</b> Family characteristics and social support have had an important influence on suicidal ideation among students returning to school during the COVID-19 epidemic.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Mental Health Among Residents of Assela Town","COVID-19 has diversified problems such as physical health, mental health, psychosocial and economic impact on people all over the world. A report from Johns Hopkins University revealed that many millions of people have been infected and millions of them lost their lives due to the virus. To assess the implementation of COVID-19 prevention mechanisms and to describe the impact of COVID-19 on people's mental health in Asella town. Descriptive survey research design was used. Two hundred and eleven randomly selected participants involved for the study. Data gathered by using PHQ-9 depressive symptom and STAI-s anxiety scales. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent sample <i>t</i>-test and one-way ANOVA with post hoc comparison. The finding revealed that 14 and 5.2% of the participants reported sometimes and occasionally wearing a mask regardless of the presence or absence of symptom. About 6.2% and 10.9% of the participants reported occasionally and never for the item avoidance of sharing utensils during meals. Half (49.3%) and 37% of the participants reported somewhat worried and very worried, respectively for concern about other family members getting COVID-19 infection. About 8.5% (M=22.64, SD=1.93) and 10 (4.7%, M=16, SD=1.42) of the participants qualify in the criteria of severe depressive symptoms and moderate-severe depressive symptoms, respectively. Conversely, 11.84% (M=52.76, SD=3.9) qualify in the criterion for severe anxiety. The independent sample <i>t</i>-test result revealed that there was statistically significant difference among males and females for anxiety mean score. However, there was no statistically significant difference among males and females for depressive symptom mean score. Regarding mental health across different age categories, the ANOVA with post hoc analysis revealed that there was statistically significant difference for state anxiety mean score among younger and older participants but not for depressive symptom mean score. Generally, there is gap in the prevention of COVID-19. In addition, there is an elevated level of depressive and anxiety symptoms during the outbreak of COVID-19 that needs urgent psychological intervention.","Disasa, Teshome","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S287477","20210715","COVID-19; depression; mental health; state anxiety and prevention mechanisms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16000,""
"Prenatal Stress and Psychiatric Symptoms During Early Phases of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy","In February 2020, Italy became the first European country to face the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The concerns of infection, financial worries, loss of freedom, and isolation during the ongoing pandemic can lead to negative psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between pandemic-related stress and pregnancy-specific stress and assess their role in the development of psychiatric symptoms. We predicted that pregnancy-specific stress would mediate an association of pandemic-related stress with psychiatric symptoms. A total of 258 pregnant women were assessed for general emotional symptoms with the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder screening (OCD). The Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ) and the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) were administered as measures of pregnancy-specific stress (PSS and pandemic-related, respectively). Mediation effects by NuPDQ for PREPS stress scales on psychiatric outcomes were calculated, using regression series and correcting for general covariates. Almost a third of the sample reported clinically relevant anxiety levels (32.6%), 11.2% were positive for OCD screening and less than 5% were positive for depression screening. The stress related to feeling unprepared for delivery and postpartum (PREPS-PS) predicted PHQ-2 score, both directly and indirectly via PSS, and it predicted GAD-7 score only indirectly. The stress related to fear of infection (PREPS-PIS) was directly associated to GAD-7 score and - through PSS - to PHQ-2 score and OCD. The pandemic onset contributed to poor mental health, especially anxiety, in a substantial portion of Italian pregnant women. Our results emphasize the importance of strategies to reduce pregnancy-specific stress, as well as to diminish stress due to the pandemic. Identifying risk factors for psychological suffering is important to prevent potential long-term consequences for mothers and their offspring.","Colli, Penengo, Garzitto, Driul, Sala, Degano, Preis, Lobel, Balestrieri","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJWH.S315467","20210715","COVID-19 pandemic; anxiety; depression; obsessive-compulsive disorder; pregnancy-specific stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16001,""
"One in Five Street Traditional Coffee Vendors Suffered from Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Harar Town, Ethiopia","The COVID-19 crisis has already resulted in an economic and labor market shock and a rise of informal work sectors. Being an informal job, traditional coffee vending can predispose women to a myriad of mental disorders. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and associated factors among street traditional coffee vendors in Harar town, Eastern Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was employed on 180 women engaged in street traditional coffee vending business in Harar town. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview using a Public Health Questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Binary logistic regression was executed to identify factors associated with depression at a cut-off point of P &lt; 0.05. The mean age of the study participants was 31.83 (Ã‚Â±10) years. The majority of the participants were currently married (n = 77, 42.8%), attended primary education (n = 68, 37.8%), had a family member of four or more (n = 60, 33.3%), and had two years or less work experience (n = 123, 68.3%). Most of the study participants obtained COVID-19-related information from television (n = 125, 69.4%). The prevalence of depression was found to be 18.9%. Attending primary education (AOR: 0.34; 95% CI: 0.12, 0.98), attending secondary education or higher (AOR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.69), and having four or more family members (AOR: 2.81; 95% CI: 1.14, 6.92) were significantly associated with depression. One in five street traditional coffee vendors suffered from depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower odds of being depressed were observed in those who attended a minimum of primary education. On the contrary, having a greater family size was associated with higher odds of being depressed. This finding will direct the government and other concerned bodies to be involved in the provision of psychological and material support for such informal workers during COVID-19.","Sisay, Gashaw, Degefu, Hagos, Alemu, Teshome, Admas, Kibret, Dessie","https://doi.org/10.2147/NDT.S315370","20210715","coronavirus; depression; street; traditional coffee vending","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16002,""
"Social isolation and its psychosocial factors in mild lockdown for the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional survey of the Japanese population","This study investigated the sociodemographic, behavioural and psychological characteristics of socially isolated individuals during the 'mild lockdown' period of COVID-19 in Japan. A cross-sectional study. The seven prefectures where the emergency declaration was first applied in Japan. We collected data on 11 333 individuals (52.4% women, 46.3Ã‚Â±14.6 years) living in the seven prefectures where the emergency declaration was first applied. The online survey was performed between 11 May and 12 May 2020, in the final phase of the state of emergency. Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6) RESULTS: We found that male sex (95% CI 1.60 to 1.98), middle age (95% CI 1.55 to 1.93) and lower income (eg, annual household income &lt;2.0 million: 95% CI 2.29 to 3.54) predicted social isolation; being a student was a protective factor against social isolation (95% CI 0.26 to 0.62). In the comparisons of each item of the LSNS-6 by sociodemographic characteristics, men were more likely to have fewer people to talk to about their personal problems (95% CI -0.37 to -0.28) and to seek help from (95% CI -0.39 to -0.30), and the middle-aged group had a lower social network of friends. Additionally, social isolation was associated with decreased online interaction with familiar people (95% CI -1.28 to -1.13) and decreased optimistic thinking under mild lockdown (95% CI -0.97 to -0.86). We identified the sociodemographic and psychological characteristics associated with social isolation under mild lockdown. These results are expected to be a useful resource for identifying which groups may require intervention to improve their social interactions in order to preserve their mental health during the pandemic.","Sugaya, Yamamoto, Suzuki, Uchiumi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-048380","20210715","COVID-19; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16003,""
"Development and validation of the Oxford Pandemic Attitude Scale-COVID-19 (OPAS-C): an internet-based cross-sectional study in the UK and USA","To develop and validate the Oxford Pandemic Attitude Scale-COVID-19 (OPAS-C), a multidimensional scale that addresses seven domains over 20 items including stress, fear, loneliness, sense of community, belief that the pandemic is a hoax or exaggerated, the use of and attitude to non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccine hesitancy, in a single measure. Cross-sectional validation study. Internet based with respondents in the USA and UK. General community respondents using the Prolific Academic platform. Exploratory factor analyses with promax oblique rotation and confirmatory factor analysis including goodness of fit indices: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) and comparative fit index (CFI). Reliability as internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha. Convergent and discriminant validity using Pearson correlation coefficients. The sample included 351 respondents in the USA and the factorial structure was confirmed using a separate set of 348 respondents in the UK. The OPAS-C had excellent goodness of fit characteristics, with an RMSEA of 0.047 (90% CI 0.037 to 0.056), SRMR of 0.043 and CFI of 0.962. Reliability was excellent, demonstrating Cronbach's alpha of 0.87 in both the US and UK samples. Convergent validity showed correlation coefficients of 0.54 and 0.49 in the US and UK samples, respectively. Discriminant validity demonstrated correlations of 0.21 and 0.26 in the US and UK samples, respectively. The OPAS-C represents the first validated scale that addresses mental health measures and public health-relevant responses to COVID-19, and may be a useful measure for use in future longitudinal and cross-sectional studies. Further international validation beyond the USA and UK may be helpful.","Kantor, Kantor","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043758","20210715","COVID-19; epidemiology; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16004,""

"Food insufficiency and mental health service utilization in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic","To estimate the association between food insufficiency and mental health service utilization in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cross-sectional study. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the associations between food insufficiency and mental health service utilization. U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey data collected in October 2020. Nationally representative sample of 68,611 U.S. adults. After adjusting for sociodemographic factors, experiencing food insufficiency was associated with higher odds of unmet mental health need (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.90; 95% CI 2.46-3.43), receiving mental health counseling or therapy (AOR 1.51; 95% CI 1.24-1.83), and psychotropic medication use (AOR 1.56; 95% CI 1.35-1.80). Anxiety and depression symptoms mediated most of the association between food insufficiency and unmet mental health need but not the associations between food insufficiency and either receiving mental health counseling/therapy or psychotropic medication use. Clinicians should regularly screen patients for food insufficiency, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Expanding access to supplemental food programs may help to mitigate the need for higher mental health service utilization during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nagata, Ganson, Cattle, Whittle, Tsai, Weiser","https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980021003001","20210715","COVID-19; food insecurity; food insufficiency; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16006,""
"Changes in Anxiety and Stress Among Pregnant Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Content Analysis of a Japanese Social Question-and-Answer Website","The changing pattern of anxiety and stress experienced by pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown. We aimed to examine the sources of anxiety and stress in pregnant women in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic. We performed content analysis of 1000 questions posted on the largest social website in Japan (Yahoo! Chiebukuro) from January 1 to May 25, 2020 (end date of the national state of emergency). The Gwet AC1 coefficient was used to verify interrater reliability. A total 12 categories were identified. Throughout the study period, anxiety related to going outdoors appeared most frequent, followed by anxiety regarding employment and infection among family and friends. Following the declaration of the state of national emergency at the peak of the infection, infection-related anxiety decreased, whereas anxiety about social support and mood disorders increased. Stress regarding relationships appeared frequent throughout the pandemic. The sources of anxiety and stress in pregnant women in Japan changed during the pandemic. Our results suggest the need for rapid communications in the early phase of a pandemic as well as long-term psychosocial support to provide optimal support to pregnant women in Japan. Health care professionals should understand the changing pattern of requirements among pregnant women.","Shirabe, Okuhara, Yokota, Okada, Goto, Kiuchi","https://doi.org/10.2196/27733","20210715","COVID-19; anxiety; content analysis; health communication; health information; mental health; pregnancy; social question-and-answer website; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-07-16","",16007,""
