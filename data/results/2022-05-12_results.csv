"Investigating the prevalence, accuracy of self-reporting, and mental health impacts of allergic disease in health care professional students during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: COVID-19 symptoms overlap with allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma, potentially impacting mental well-being [1]. Research regarding the effects of anxiety and stress on Health Care Professional (HCP) students throughout the COVID-19 pandemic is beginning to emerge. It is currently unknown if trainees with atopic conditions experience different stress levels than their non-atopic peers. In Canadian adults, the estimated prevalence for AR and food allergy(FA) is 44% and 6.1%, respectively [2,3]. Methods: Between August 2020 to June 2021, Faculty of Health Sciences students (n = 266) completed a one-time questionnaire using the QualtricsXMTMsurvey platform of which 114 respondents disclosed their atopic status. The following data was collected: Self-reported atopy status, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7(GAD-7), Patient Health Questionaire-9(PHQ-9), and Perceived Stress Score-10(PSS-10). Participants were then classified based on the type and number of atopic conditions they reported. A follow-up visit involving skin prick testing (SPT) to a standard panel of 9 aeroallergen and food extracts, and/or fresh fruits, where applicable, was completed (n = 34) to determine how accurately allergies were self-reported. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 27. Results: Having a self-reported allergic condition or asthma did not impact GAD-7, PSS, and PHQ-9 scores, in HCP students. Further stratifying the dataset by the type and number of allergic conditions also did not impact GAD-7, PSS, and PHQ-9 scores or severity. The self-reported prevalence of asthma, AR and FA was 5.71%, 64.71%, and 29.41%, respectively. SPT confirmed 64.71% and 8.82% of participants were sensitized to AR and food allergens, respectively. Generally, seasonal AR allergies were underreported whereas, perennial AR and FA were overreported. Conclusions: Atopic conditions did not impact mental health scores in HCP student's which suggests that they are generally aware of their atopic conditions and able to differentiate allergy and COVID-19 symptoms. Self-reported accuracy varied and may be impacted by the specific allergic condition.","Burrows, A. G.; Joy, S.; Garvey, S.; Linton, S.; Thiele, J.; Steacy, L. M.; Tripp, D. A.; Ellis, A.

"Financial hardship and mental health among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic: An analysis of the US COVID Impact Survey","Background: Cancer survivors often experience financial hardship due to high costs associated with cancer treatment. Our objective was to (1) identify determinants of financial hardship, and to (2) evaluate the impact of financial hardship on mental health symptoms among cancer survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We used nationally representative data from the COVID-19 Household Impact Survey collected at three-time points: April 20-26, May 4-10, and May 30th -June 8 th of 2020. Our primary exposure was cancer survivor status, based on participant's self-report of a cancer diagnosis (n=854, 7.1%). We defined financial hardship using the following question: â€œSuppose you have an unexpected expense that costs $400. Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for this expense?â€ Respondents were categorized as experiencing financial hardship if they chose the following options: I wouldn't be able to pay for it right now;sell something;use a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft;borrow from a friend or family member. Chi-square (<U+03C7>2 ) tests were used to compare reported financial hardship among cancer survivors to other U.S. adults. Multivariable Poisson regression was used to identify determinants of financial hardship among cancer survivors. We used multinomial logistic regression to evaluate associations of financial hardship on mental health symptoms of cancer survivors. Results: Eighteen percent of cancer survivors reported experiencing financial hardship. Cancer survivors aged 30-44 (44.8%) and 45-59 years (25.9%) more frequently reported financial hardship compared to adults without cancer (23.4%, 16.7%, respectively, <U+03C7>2p&lt;0.05). Compared to cancer survivors aged 60+ years, those aged 18-29 (aPR: 2.54, 95% CI;1.51-4.28), 30-44 (aPR:3.41, 95% CI:2.26-5.16), and 45-59 years (aPR:3.66, 95% CI:2.26-5.16) were more likely to experience financial hardship. Cancer survivors on Medicaid (aPR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.16-2.66) were more likely to experience financial hardship compared to their counterparts. Compared to those without a high school degree, cancer survivors with some college education (aPR: 0.30, 95% CI: 0.18-0.47) and with a =Baccalaureate degree (aPR:0.05, 95% CI: 0.02- 0.14) were less likely to experience financial hardship. Rural cancer survivors had 61% higher prevalence of financial hardship compared to urban residents (aPR: 1.61, 95% CI:1.00-2.58), however, suburban residents were less likely to experience financial hardship compared to cancer survivors living in urban areas (aPR: 0.65, 95% CI:0.44-0.98). Cancer survivors who experienced financial hardship were more likely to report feeling depressed (aOR: 2.78, 95% CI: 1.39-5.56), lonely (aOR: 3.06, 95% CI: 1.39-6.72), and hopeless (aOR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.36-7.37) 3-7 days during the last 7 days. Conclusion: Lower SES measures and younger age were determinants of experiencing financial hardship among cancer survivors. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a high burden of mental health symptoms among cancer survivors experiencing financial hardship.","Islam, J. Y.; Vidot, D.

"Telehealth experiences of adolescent and young adult cancer patients and survivors during the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose: To describe adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer patients' and survivors' experiences with telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Eligible participants were identified through the Huntsman Intermountain Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Care Program, which provides age-specific programming and patient navigation to AYA cancer patients and survivors in Utah and surrounding Mountain West states. Participants were emailed an online survey if they were currently age 18 or older and had been diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15-39 years. We applied descriptive statistics to summarize demographics, comfortability with technology, access to reliable internet connection, and perceived quality of care while using telehealth. Results: AYAs (N=280) were an average of 29.4 years old at survey (range 18-58);65.2% were female and 82.4% non-Hispanic white. Over half (54.2%) had received cancer treatment since March 2020. All participants reported owning a computer, tablet, and/or smart phone they could use for telehealth appointments. The majority (93.5%) reported almost always or always having a reliable internet connection. AYAs felt most comfortable having a telehealth appointment in their own home (96.4%);only 12.5% felt comfortable using telehealth at work. Since March 2020, (N=183) 65.4% had a health care visit moved to a telehealth platform due to COVID-19. Of those who recently moved to telehealth, 60.1% had an oncology visit, 33.9% had a primary care visit, and 31.1% had a mental health visit. Additionally over one-third (35.2%) reported the quality of their medical care had decreased since moving to telehealth. This was most commonly due to 1) troubles with audio, video, or connecting through telehealth platforms;2) telehealth visits feeling impersonal;and 3) feeling that providers more easily dismissed or did not fully address their symptoms. Conclusions: Although AYAs are digital natives, over one third of AYAs feel the quality of their medical care has decreased since moving to telehealth for COVID-19. Further research should explore medical provider training in using telehealth systems and encourage telehealth practices that help AYAs feel more supported and understood.","Mann, K.; Waters, A.

"Mental health and coping during COVID-19 among cancer patients and survivors","Background and Purpose: Until a vaccine is widely available, adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors is the most effective way to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is a general paucity of information on COVID-19 infection and its impact on cancer patients, immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients, are likely at greater risk for both COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. In addition, a cancer diagnosis can cause stress, anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and poor quality of life. While the recommendations for COVID-19 parallel the common recommendations for managing infection risk, the enhanced social isolation and limited social distancing can be even more difficult for patients resulting in increased risk for psychological distress and deteriorations in health outcomes. Depressive disorders frequently result in substantial functional impairment, as well as increased emotional, economic, and productivity costs. It is important to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts psychological and psychosocial factors, as well as health behaviors of cancer patients and survivors, and how various contextual factors may play risk and protective roles. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to determine differences in stress, mental health and coping behaviors, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic among three groups of adults (in active cancer treatment, cancer survivors, and those without a history of cancer). This study focuses on determining how sociodemographic characteristics and cancer status influence COVID-19 mental health/coping mechanisms, as well as how mental health/coping mechanisms and cancer status may predict adherence to preventive COVID-19 behaviors. Methods: Panel survey firm Qualtrics was used to administer an online survey among 897 U.S. adults in May of 2020. Quota sampling was utilized to ensure a sample consisting of approximately one-third: cancer patients currently in treatment (32.0%, n = 287), cancer survivors not currently in treatment (33.6%, n=301), and respondents with no cancer history (34.4%, n = 309). Survey items assessed demographic variables, depression, coping, and adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Results and Discussion: Preliminary analyses show that cancer patients report higher levels of depressive symptoms than survivors and the control group. In addition, cancer patients in active treatment use both avoidance and approach-focused coping more frequently than both survivors and the control group. Regression analyses show that avoidance coping predicts lower adherence to COVID-19 preventive behaviors, while approach-focused coping predicts higher adherence. Analyses are ongoing.","Guidry, J.

"Sleep quality in children with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD)","Introduction: PCD is a rare, progressive disease resulting in upper and lower respiratory tract manifestations that increase the risk of sleep disordered breathing. This study is the first to characterize sleep quality in Australian children with PCD and examine it is relationship to mood and health-related quality of life (HrQOL). Methods: Clinically stable children with PCD (1-18 years of age) were recruited. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the SDSC, PDSS and OSA-18 questionnaires. HrQOL and depressive symptoms were assessed via age-appropriate QOL-PCD and CDI questionnaires. Demographic data including passive smoke exposure was recorded. Pulmonary function testing and ENT assessments were performed. Children underwent overnight polysomnography including transcutaneous CO2 and video monitoring (50% studies complete due to Covid restrictions). Results: Twenty-two participants (10 female) aged 8.1 Â± 5.1 (mean Â± SD) years were recruited. Mean(Â±SD) FEV1 was 78.2 Â± 21.2%. Ninety-two percent of children assessed were diagnosed with chronic rhinosinusitis and 35% exposed to regular passive cigarette smoke. Polysomnography identified sleep fragmentation in 90% of studies and one case of mild obstructive sleep apnoea. Subjective sleep questionnaires revealed 76% of parents and 50% of children reported clinically significant scores indicating sleep disturbance and excessive daytime somnolence respectively. Twenty-seven percent of parents reported a moderate-severe impact of sleep disturbance on QOL. Forty-six percent of children had elevated depression scores. HrQOL and mood scores were correlated with poor subjective sleep quality. Children exposed to passive cigarette smoke had poorer subjective sleep quality and lower HrQOL and mood. Conclusion: Even in periods of clinical stability, children with PCD exhibit poor sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness and this is associated with lower mood and HrQOL. Based on these findings, we recommend routine screening for mental health and symptoms of sleep disturbance in children and adolescents with PCD. The continued education of children and families regarding the effects of cigarette smoke is advised.","Ewert, I.; Robinson, P.; Adams, A.; Vandeleur, M.","https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.14226","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Respirology; 27(SUPPL 1):185, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31204,""
"Pulmonary tele-rehabilitation is effective and safe for people with respiratory conditions","Introduction/Aim: Pulmonary tele-rehabilitation (PTR) became a way of providing exercise training and education for people with respiratory conditions during the COVID- 19 pandemic. To determine if PTR was safe, improved exercise capacity, breathlessness and health-related quality of life. Methods: Retrospective observational study. Participants had COPD, bronchiectasis, interstitial lung disease, asthma or recent lung surgery. As well as access to WIFI and a home device for videoconferencing. Outcomes: five time sitto- stand (5STS), 1 min sit-to-stand (1MinSTS);St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ);COPD assessment test (CAT);Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS);Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnoea scale, number of adverse events. PTR used a zoom platform, ran for 40 min twice per week for 8 weeks, with a maximum of 10 participants in each class. An experienced physiotherapist led the exercise sessions with support from physiotherapy students. Results: Seventy-five people (66 females) commenced PTR [mean (SD): Age 67 (11) years, FEV1 63 (20) % pred] and 52 (70%) completed. Statistically significant improvement (mean change (SD) [95% CI]) for 5STS: -4 (7) [-6 to -1] s;1MinSTS: 5 (8) [2-9] times;SGRQ total: -7 (12) [-11 to -3] points;mMRC: -0.3 (0.7) [-0.6 to -0.7] score;CAT: -2.4 (6) [-4 to -0.5] score.

"The politics of distress","We are regularly told that mental health problems are becoming more and more prevalent today, a trend exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. This way of conceiving what might rather be called people'sâ€”and particularly young people'sâ€”distress has several sources. Medical science has made spectacular progress over the last 50 years, encouraging us to look to it for solutions whenever things go wrong for people. A strongly atomistic line of Anglophone political thinking about the relation between individuals and society carries a bias in favour of trying to fix the former rather than the latter. Yet, there are good grounds for thinking that in many cases psychological distress comes from the way that people relate to each other and to the sociopolitical world that we have allowed to come into being. The last part of the paper gives examples of this from the experience of young people during the recent COVID-19 pandemic.","Smith, Richard","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9752.12659","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Philosophy of Education; 56(1):105-114, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31206,""
"Introduction: The crisis in mental health and education","The introduction to this Policy Special Issue begins by situating the themes of mental health and education in the broader context of the public mental health conversation, and the new challenges to individual and collective life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. It then charts some of the ways mental health has developed in educational thinking and educational policy in recent years. Philosophy is then introduced as a form of thinking that encourages a slowing down ofâ€”and critical a standing back fromâ€”the momentum that gathers around the proliferation of talk about young people's problems in mental health in society, and the interventions designed to tackle these problems in education. What brings the contributions of this Policy Special Issue together is, it is observed, a degree of unease about current approaches to mental health in education. An overview of the contributions is then provided, which introduces the reader to the ways that philosophical thinking is brought to challenge and reconceive current ways of thinking about mental health in education in this Policy Special Issue. The five sections of the Policy Special Issue are also introduced: From clinics to classrooms;Tackling mental health in the curriculum;Sickness in society;Language in crisis;and Curing education.","Williams, Emma","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9752.12657","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Philosophy of Education; 56(1):4-11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31207,""
"â€˜Psychoanalysis is one more way of taking people seriouslyâ€™: Adam Phillips in conversation with Emma Williams","Adam Phillips is a leading psychoanalyst and author. Phillips was educated at Clifton College and studied English Literature at Oxford University. He trained to be a psychoanalyst at the Institute of Child Psychology. Across the course of his professional career, he has worked at Guys Hospital, with a school for â€˜maladjusted childrenâ€™, at Camberwell Child Guidance Clinic and at Charing Cross Hospital in the Department of Child Psychiatry. He now works in private practice. Phillips is the author of many works, including Terrors and Experts (1997), In Writing: Essays on Literature (2016), Attention Seeking (2019) and his most recent book, The Cure for Psychoanalysis (2021). He also served as the General Editor of the New Penguin Classics Translations of the works of Sigmund Freud.The conversation begins by exploring the way mental health has become a topic of public interest as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The opportunities and challenges in Phillips's experience working with schools and for young people's mental health services during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s are then discussed. Questions about the nature of psychoanalysis are introduced, and the discussion turns towards the relationship between philosophy, literature and psychoanalysis. There is a brief discussion of connections between Phillips's work and the philosophy of Stanley Cavell. Phillips's essays on schools and education are explored in connection with ideas of omniscience, sadomasochism and â€˜experiments in livingâ€™. The conversation ends with a glimpse of school as a place to cultivate one's interest and one's sociability with others.","Phillips, Adam, Williams, Emma","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9752.12624","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Philosophy of Education; 56(1):180-189, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31208,""
"A critical review of public-private partnerships in the COVID-19 pandemic: key themes and future research agenda","Purpose Undoubtedly, coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has released unprecedented disruptions and health crisis on people and activities everywhere. The impacts extend to public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements in the construction industry. Concomitantly, PPP pacts are contributing to combat the pandemic. However, literature on the PPP concept in the COVID-19 era remain under-researched. This study aims to review the current literature on PPPs in the COVID-19 pandemic and present the key themes, research gaps and future research directions. Design/methodology/approach In this study, 29 highly relevant literature were sourced from Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed search engines within the systematic literature review (SLR) methodology. With the aid of qualitative content analysis, the 29 articles were critically analysed leading to the extraction of hot research themes on PPPs in the coronavirus pandemic. Findings The results of the SLR produced eight themes such as major changes in PPP contracts, development of the COVID-19 vaccines, economic recession, facemasks and testing kits, governance and sustainability of PPPs. In addition, the study reveals seven research gaps that need further investigations among the scientific research community on mental health and post-pandemic recovery plans. Research limitations/implications The articles selected for this review were limited to only peer-reviewed journal papers written in English excluding conference papers. This restriction may have taken out some relevant literature but they had insignificant impact on the overall outcome of this research. Practical implications To improve the understanding of practitioners in the construction industry on key issues on PPPs in the COVID-19 pandemic, the study provides them a checklist of relevant themes. Originality/value As a novel literature review relating PPPs to the coronavirus, it sets the foundation for further research and contributes to practical measures to control the virus.","Akomea-Frimpong, I.; Jin, X.

"A new era in psychiatry: the impacts of COVID-19 and the shift to telepsychiatry on clinical practice and clinician well-being","Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has actively changed the face of all medical disciplines, including mental health practices. In a matter of days from the introduction of the lockdown, clinicians have to adapt to new working models with many changing the consultation methods clinicians have utilized for years. To best understand the wider clinical impact, a limited study was carried out to assess the effect of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on psychiatric clinical practice. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative study was performed to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on clinician practice at a UK secure care mental health facility. A four-question free-text survey was distributed online to all physicians and seven responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings Four key themes were identified - use of technology, the importance of face-to-face contact, work/life balance and mental well-being. Practical implications Overall, the results of the study reported that although some negative changes to the traditional work-life balance were identified, the clinicians found remote working within a secure care setting cultivated a more efficient working environment while allowing for more effective social distance practices. Originality/value This study highlighted some of the challenges faced by clinicians employed in a secure care mental health setting following the introduction of lockdown measures in the UK associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. The study will also inform future work practices, including the potential of longer term remote working in this sector.","Celentano, L.; Brenisin, K.; Breen, K.

"Difficulties experienced by managers in the coordination of teams working from home: an exploratory study considering the COVID-19 pandemic","Purpose This research aims to analyse difficulties experienced by Brazilian managers in coordinating teams working from home during the coronavirus disease (2019) COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The methodological strategy used was a survey with 39 managers who led teams working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Seven difficulties indicated by current literature were analysed using a fuzzy scale. First, a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) approach was used to group managers according to managers' similarities and capacity to infer the difficulties. Responses of each group identified were weighted considering the capacity to assess the theme. In the sequence, data were analysed via frequencies and the fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach and difficulties were ordered. Findings Comparatively, the main difficulties evidenced are (1) to reconcile personal and professional life tasks in the same place;(2) to motivate collaborators in a period when social isolation affect employee's mental health and (3) to keep team members integrated and working within the activities scope in a virtual environment. Originality/value The findings present in this paper contribute to theory and practice. For theory, this article contributes to the knowledge on WFH and leadership, evidencing in a comparatively way the difficulties that are experienced by managers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers in future studies can better analyse these difficulties. For practice, managers who conduct managers' teams remotely can use the information to analyse teams' practices and improve performance critically. This was an atypical moment of humanity, and different aspects need to be considered by managers compared with previous periods.","Rodrigues, E. A.; Rampasso, I. S.; Serafim, M.

"A cohort study examining the association between children's symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity, internalizing symptoms, and mindful parenting during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objectives Increased mental health difficulties have been reported in Canadian children as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and emerging research suggests that children with high levels of symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity have been disproportionately impacted. Accordingly, the pandemic has impacted families as well. The purpose of this study was the following: (1) to examine whether children's symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity at the beginning of the 2020 and 2021 academic year were associated with mindful parenting at the end of the academic year and (2) to examine whether children's depressive and anxiety symptoms at the end of the year moderated this relationship. Methods Parents of 114 young children in a large Canadian city participated in this study in the Winter of 2020 and the Spring of 2021. Parents completed several self-report scales used to measure children's mental health symptomatology and mindfulness in parenting. Results Children's symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were significantly, negatively associated with mindful parenting across the pandemic year, and children's depressive symptoms moderated this relationship. Specifically, when children's depressive symptoms were low or average it was found that higher symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were associated with lower levels of mindful parenting. However, when children's depressive symptoms were high their symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity were not predictive of mindful parenting. Conclusions Children's mental health, namely symptoms of inattention/hyperactivity and depression, are related to challenges in mindful parenting during COVID-19. These results may inform practitioners about which families require additional support during the pandemic.","O'Reilly, H.; Rogers, M.; Ogg, J.; Ritchie, T.; Whitley, J.; Santuzzi, A.; Shelleby, E.

"MAKING COMMUNITY PHARMACIES PSYCHOLOGICALLY INFORMED ENVIRONMENTS: A PILOT STUDY TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OF CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH A DRUG PROBLEM","Introduction: Community pharmacies are key in the delivery of care to people who use drugs (PWUD), providing specialist harm reduction, and treatment interventions such as naloxone, Injecting Equipment Provision and opiate replacement treatment. PWUD are disproportionately burdened with mental ill-health and frequently report trauma history which impacts on engagement. A successful approach in the homeless sector, is that of Psychologically Informed Environments (PIE). The core elements of a PIE are: creating a space which engenders a sense of safety and wellbeing;reflective practice so staff can develop a shared model of working;training and support for staff;and considering the therapeutic aspects of service provision to vulnerable people (1). Aim: This pilot study tested training pharmacy staff in applying a psychologically informed environments approach to improve the delivery of care to PWUD. Methods: Three pharmacies were recruited from those with high involvement with PWUD. A range of location and type of pharmacy were included. Whole pharmacy teams were invited to an evening training session. Bespoke training was provided by clinical psychologists with PIE expertise. Training was assessed by anonymous quantitative questionnaires using rating scales. Changes in the attitudes of staff were assessed by questionnaire before and 6 months after training. Descriptive statistics were applied. Qualitative interviews with staff at 6 months (planned for 3 months) explored what changes, were made after PIE training to adapt the delivery of care. The study used peer researcher-led telephone interviews for patient/client feedback on observed changes and experiences in participating pharmacies. Recruitment was via the three pharmacy teams due to covid restrictions. Thematic analysis was applied to qualitative data. Normalisation Process Theory provided a framework for assessing change. Results: Three pharmacies (16 staff) participated. Training evaluation was positive;all participants rating training structure and delivery as very good or excellent. Covid-19 lockdowns restricted follow-up data collection which took place at six months rather than three. Attitude scores were positive (&gt;0) for all participants at baseline (median 15.0) increasing to 20.0 at 6 months. This was not statistically significant (S=4, p=0.549). Staff interviews revealed training had encouraged staff to reflect on communication and considered the impact of current practice which could be discriminatory e.g. their use of first names, use of private areas and level of explanation to people. The increased mental health challenges for patients from Covid-19 restrictions gave an opportunity for staff to apply their new skills to this patient group and others who were struggling with isolation, as staff across pharmacies noted mental health challenges for patients. Five patients from two pharmacies were interviewed but time delays in data collection meant changes in delivery of care were difficult to recall. Conclusion: The study was limited by small sample size and covid-related delays. However, findings indicated that training whole pharmacy teams in PIE was well received and justifies a larger study. The approach allowed staff to reflect on practice and identify previous, potentially discriminatory practice. The importance of clear and compassionate communication was evident.","Matheson, C.; Hunter, C.; Schofield, J.; Parkes, T.; Munro, A.; O'Sullivan, K.; Hunter, J.","https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpp/riac021.011","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Pharmacy Practice; 30(SUPPL 1):i8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31213,""
"Barriers and Facilitators of Mental Health Service Utilisation among Bhutanese Refugees in the USA: Findings from a Mixed-Methods Study","Although discussions regarding the need to develop culturally responsive mental health services for resettled refugee populations in the USA have been burgeoning, efforts to comprehensively understand the unique barriers and facilitators of mental health services across refugee subpopulations remain fragmented. Our study explored the barriers and facilitators of mental health services experienced by the resettled Bhutanese refugee population in a Midwestern city in the USA using a two-phased sequential explanatory mixed-methods study (N  =   46). Study findings draw much needed attention to culturally grounded solutions generated by the community to reduce barriers and increase facilitators of mental health engagement. Building on community-generated solutions and expanding the capacity of local community-based ethnic organisations will be the first step in providing services that are truly responsive to the cultural needs of the Bhutanese refugee population. Recognition of refugee communities' unique collective strengths will be much needed to holistically collaborate with these new members of the society to promote mental well-being and foster a sense of inclusion and belonging, especially in the post-coronavirus pandemic context. Our study also contributes to emerging knowledge on methodological rigor in research amongst understudied, hard-to-reach populations.","Soukenik, Eliza, Haran, Hanna, Kirsch, Jaclyn, Pyakurel, Sudarshan, Maleku, Arati","https://doi.org/10.1093/bjsw/bcab123","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: British Journal of Social Work; 52(3):1552-1576, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31214,""
"The Arabic version of the fear of covid-19 scale: psychometric properties and relationship to future anxiety in Jordanians","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused various psychological problems worldwide, such as fear, anxiety, and depression. Since the fear of the pandemic can adversely affect disease management, it must be measured appropriately. This study aims to verify the validity and reliability of the Arabic version of FCV-19S and its relation to future anxiety in Jordanians. This cross-sectional study was conducted from September 8 to 28, 2020 on a sample of 760 Jordanian participants. According to the results, the seven items of the scale were loaded on one component, and they explained 66.3% of the total variance. Both the classical test theory and the item response theory (Rasch model) were used to evaluate the psychometric properties of the fear of COVID-19 scale items. The internal consistency (alpha) was0.91. The concurrent validity was supported by the future anxiety scale (r = 0.87).The Rasch model offered good psychometric properties for the Jordanian version of the FCV-195. The measurement invariance showed no differences concerning gender or age. The Jordanian FCV-19S was thus found to be an effective screening scale for assessing the fear of COVID-19 among the adult Jordanian population.","Murad, O.; Al-Dassean, K. A.; Al Neweiri, A.

"English validation of the chronic and acute stress inventory for use with individuals in a romantic relationship","Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals across the U.S. reported experiencing high levels of stress that negatively impacted their overall mental health and well-being;levels that have undoubtedly increased since this time. Despite the interest in understanding how stress can impact individual and relational wellbeing, there are no validated measures that examine chronic and acute stressors experienced by individuals in a romantic relationship. Using self-report data from 327 individuals in the U.S., the present study evaluated and validated the psychometric properties of the Italian version of the Chronic and Acute Stress Index (CASI) for use with individuals in a romantic relationship. Results indicated that the English version of the CASI demonstrated good reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity.

"Taking a Break from On-field Soccer Activity May be Beneficial to Collegiate Women Soccer Players","Introduction: A typical season for Canadian collegiate women soccer players consists of a pre-season training camp, in-season competitive games, and in-season practices. Over the course of a single season, players are exposed to a high number of subconcussive head impacts (1), which have been hypothesized to lead to cumulative brain trauma (2). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, collegiate athletes in Canada did not have an inperson pre-season and off-season training was conducted virtually. Players experienced extended time off from the field and thus their training was less focused on soccer-specific training and more focused on fitness retention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the COVID-19 effect of playing time restrictions on brain function (using electroencephalography (EEG) and N-back-2), sleep, anxiety, and depression. Methods: Ten female collegiate soccer players were recruited. EEG, N-Back-2, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) were collected during both the 2019 and 2020 seasons (1-3). Average spectral power density was calculated across five frequency bands. Accuracy and reaction time were evaluated for the N-Back-2. PSQI, SCI and HADS scores were evaluated. Results: When comparing the end of the 2019 season and the beginning of the 2020 season, power analysis of the resting state EEG demonstrated a decrease in power spectral density across the delta, theta, and alpha frequency bands. There was a 9% increase in accuracy and a 3% decrease in reaction time using the N-Back-2. There was no change in sleep quality using the PSQI but a 6% change in sleep condition using the SCI. There was a 25% decrease in depression and a 19% decrease in anxiety. Discussion: This study is unique in our ability to access a significant time off in between two collegiate soccer seasons. Our pilot data suggests that there is an association between brain function, sleep and anxiety and depression after a stoppage in playing time. Varsity athletes are used to playing consistently over the course of their collegiate season, even playing through the summer. Additionally, on-filed practices and games expose players to a high number of subconcussive impacts. This pilot study sheds light on the potential benefit of providing collegiate athletes time off from on-field activities in between their collegiate seasons to fully recover from the strains of the season (4). Additionally, a switch in focus from on-field work to fitness-based activities may help alleviate athlete burnout and may boost overall stressors experienced by high-performance athletes (5,6). This is a preliminary pilot study and data analysis is ongoing. Further analyses will be conducted to better understand these relationships.","Kenny, R.; Elez, M.; Wong, S.; Ha, B.; Virji-Babul, N.","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699052.2021.2023296","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain Injury; 36(SUPPL 1):121, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31217,""
"Disasters and catastrophes: the impact on people with disabilitiesâ€™ leisure-time physical activity participation and associative mental health and well-being","Disasters disrupt peopleâ€™s ability to be physically active. Despite the well-known health benefits of physical activity, there is limited understanding of how disasters may affect those who experience constraints to being active, such as people with disabilities. This study explored how one major disaster, the COVID-19 pandemic, affected people with disabilitiesâ€™ participation in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) and their mental health and well-being. An online survey was completed by 959 participants. Latent class analysis based on four questions asking the impact of COVID-19 on LTPA was used to identify 4 distinct classes: â€˜Heavily Impactedâ€™, â€˜Adaptedâ€™, â€˜Resilientâ€™, and â€˜Radically Changedâ€™. Disability categorisation, veteran status, and gender predicted latent class membership. Results from multinomial regression revealed that the Heavily Impacted members reported significantly lower mean scores for life satisfaction, quality of life, and general health, along with poorer mean scores for loneliness than other groups. In contrast, the Resilient members reported significantly higher mean scores of quality of life and general health than other groups. Qualitative data analysis further suggests that respondents participated in myriad LTPA modes that included somewhat technology adoption. People with disabilitiesâ€™ LTPA was negatively affected by the pandemic, with those most heavily impacted having poorer mental health indices.

"Assessment of Burnout and Anxiety in Health Personnel during the Covid-19 Pandemic","Objective The Covid-19 pandemic has had consequences on the mental health of health personnel, a vulnerable population that is on the front lines of attention. Long working hours, as well as the fear of getting sick and transmitting the virus to their families, generate high levels of anxiety and burnout. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the presence of burnout and anxiety in health personnel during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods The Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Hamilton anxiety scale were distributed electronically and prospectively to 566 health workers in Colombia from March to April 2020. Additionally, age, level of schooling, marital status, occupation, source of income, type of contract, and the number of jobs and working hours were evaluated. Results A total of 566 health professionals were evaluated, 60.8% of whom were women, and 39.2% of whom were men. The sample was composed of 85.3% of doctors, 9.2% of nurses, and the other 5.5% corresponded to administrative staff, dentists, and paramedics. Of the aforementioned, 19.3% had 3 or more jobs. The survey reported high levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, with low levels of personal fulfillment. Additionally, mild anxiety was evident. Conclusions One of the most important consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic is the effects of burnout and anxiety in health personnel. Given our results, it is essential to highlight the importance of psychological support for health personnel in these times of fear and uncertainty.","FernÃ¡ndez, N.; Prada, S.; Villanueva-Congote, J.; RodrÃ­guez, S.","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0042-1748051","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Urologia Colombiana; 31(1):6-11, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31219,""
"Rural tele-mental health use during the pandemic for adjustment disorders, anxiety, and depression","The author's affiliation with The MITRE Corporation is provided for identification purposes only and is not intended to convey or imply MITRE's concurrence with, or support for, the positions, opinions, or viewpoints expressed by the author.The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic contributed to widespread distress across the U.S., with a growing incidence of adjustment disorders, anxiety, and depression across the population. The use of tele-mental health services is a critical resource for reaching individuals who need access to mental health services, whether due to challenges with distance, lack of local provider access, or a result of stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19. This study compared the use and type of tele-mental health services (medical vs. nonmedical) administered for the three mental health diagnosis sets by rural versus urban geography. A retrospective study was conducted during a 16-month study period (November 2019-February 2021) using a large health system database to examine the use of tele-mental health services for three mental health diagnosis sets: adjustment disorder, anxiety, and depression. The utilization of tele-mental health services was evaluated across urban and rural lines, by medical versus nonmedical visit type, and additionally by broadband availability. After a brief initial rise, rural communities saw a steeper decline in tele-mental health service utilization relative to their urban counterparts, even as rural communities experienced a surge in COVID-19 cases. This is potentially an indication that rural areas may be slower to adapt to tele-mental health delivery of care relative to their urban counterparts. Consistent with the evidence base on rural-urban health and socioeconomic disparity, the study team found that rural areas lag compared to their urban counterparts in accommodating tele-mental health technology for health emergencies. It is important for health services researchers to investigate the technological as well as nontechnological factors related to sustained tele-mental health utilization. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement This study suggests that there are disparities in adoption of tele-mental health services between rural and urban areas. Although rural populations initially embraced tele-mental health services, even when rural communities had highest surges of COVID-19 cases those areas showed a significant decline in services compared to urban areas, which suggests additional ways are needed to improve rural health engagement for use of tele-mental health services.

"Who Benefits Most From Suicide Prevention Workshops in Schools?","To improve suicide prevention in schools, we implemented workshops for students in grades 8-10. The students (N=200) were randomly assigned to either a training or a control group and were surveyed regarding their help-seeking and help-giving behavior and their depressive symptoms both before and after the training as well as 3 months later. The results indicate that especially those students assessed to be at a higher risk for suicide benefitted most from the training. Their number of depressive symptoms decreased significantly and remained stable. Participants undergoing the training tended to be more likely to ask a teacher for help and to initiate more crisis counseling interactions with peers in need than did untrained controls;these differences, however, were not statistically significant. Though hampered by high dropout rates because of the Covid-19 pandemic and a restrictive prescreening process. these results indicate the positive effects of an extracurricular suicide prevention program on students' well-being and behavior.","Bockhoff, K.; Bruder, S.; Ellermeier, W.; Rohrbach, T.; Hertel, U.

"Mental Health Impact of COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study on Italian Twins","Introduction: There are concerns that the Covid-19 crisis and measures to mitigate virus transmission may have caused a considerable burden on population mental health. In June 2020, the Italian Twin Registry (ITR) set up a longitudinal study to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on depressive and anxiety symptoms. Methods: In June 2020 and December 2020 (Wave1 and Wave2, respectively) twins were invited to complete an online questionnaire. The questionnaire included the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), and the six item version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6) for detecting probable depression and anxiety, respectively. For each of the two instruments, phenotypic correlation between the two waves was estimated, and bivariate Chole sky models were fitted to explore the genetic and environmental contributions to the observed longitudinal patterns. Results: About 300 adult twin pairs participated in the study. Substantial longitudinal correlations were observed for PHQ-9 (r = .67) and STAI-6 scores (r = .57). Bivariate models including additive genetic and unshared environmental influences best fitted the longitudinal data for these traits. Under these models, heritability estimates for the PHQ-9 were 0.38 (Wave1) and 0.43 (Wave2), and 0.40 (Wave1) and 0.38 (Wave2) for the STAI-6. Genetic correlations between the two waves (.99 PHQ-9, .91 STAI-6) were higher than unshared environmental correlations (.45 PHQ-9, .36 STAI-6). Conclusions: The study suggests that the pandemic led to an increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms. The longitudinal stability of this symptomatology is mainly genetically determined, while the observed environmental discontinuity is consistent with changes in life conditions during the pandemic.","Medda, E.; Fagnani, C.; Picardi, A.; Gigantesco, A.; Ferri, M.; D'Ippolito, C.; Stazi, M.

"A daily diary study into the effects on mental health of COVID-19 pandemic-related behaviors","Background Recommendations for promoting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include maintaining social contact, through virtual rather than physical contact, moderating substance/alcohol use, and limiting news and media exposure. We seek to understand if these pandemic-related behaviors impact subsequent mental health. Methods Daily online survey data were collected on adults during May/June 2020. Measures were of daily physical and virtual (online) contact with others;substance and media use;and indices of psychological striving, struggling and COVID-related worry. Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel analysis, dynamic within-person cross-lagged effects were separated from more static individual differences. Results In total, 1148 participants completed daily surveys [657 (57.2%) females, 484 (42.1%) males;mean age 40.6 (s.d. 12.4) years]. Daily increases in news consumed increased COVID-related worrying the next day [cross-lagged estimate = 0.034 (95% CI 0.018-0.049), FDR-adjusted p = 0.00005] and vice versa [0.03 (0.012-0.048), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0017]. Increased media consumption also exacerbated subsequent psychological struggling [0.064 (0.03-0.098), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0005]. There were no significant cross-lagged effects of daily changes in social distancing or virtual contact on later mental health. Conclusions We delineate a cycle wherein a daily increase in media consumption results in a subsequent increase in COVID-related worries, which in turn increases daily media consumption. Moreover, the adverse impact of news extended to broader measures of psychological struggling. A similar dynamic did not unfold between the daily amount of physical or virtual contact and subsequent mental health. Findings are consistent with current recommendations to moderate news and media consumption in order to promote mental health.","Shaw, P.; Blizzard, S.; Shastri, G.; Kundzicz, P.; Curtis, B.; Ungar, L.; Koehly, L.","https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001896","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychological Medicine;: 9, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31223,""
"'Listen closer': home-delivered meal volunteers' understanding of their role in suicide intervention","Suicide in later life is a pressing public health concern, which has likely been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many older adults who need mental health treatment do not have access to necessary services and training for mental health providers to support older adults experiencing suicidality is limited. One solution is developing interventions based in a public health approach to suicide prevention, whereby natural helpers who provide community services are mobilised to respond to older persons-at-risk. Home-delivered meal (HDM) services, for example, are one effective means to reach older adults who are isolated due to being homebound and may be instrumental in preventing suicide. This study examined the experiences of 20 HDM volunteers who received Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training (ASIST), an evidence-based suicide intervention programme. Phenomenological analysis yielded findings centred on three areas demonstrating the impact of the ASIST training on HDM volunteers: putting asist skills into practice;response to ASIST skills;and role transformation. Implications for integrating suicide prevention efforts with HDM services and directions for future research are discussed.","Westcott, J. B.; Fullen, M. C.; Tomlin, C.

"Resilience and perseverance under siege: providing cancer care during the invasion of Ukraine","Conflict-associated disruptions in cancer treatment and survivorship care differ by locale and change as the military operations unfold. Since the beginning of the war and as of the writing of this Essay, the capital city of Kyiv has been protected by a robust anti-missile defence system and sustained less damage despite persistent bombardment, allowing some patients with cancerâ€”including childrenâ€”to evacuate safely. Individuals diagnosed with certain cancers, especially those with haematological malignancies and those receiving highly immunosuppressive chemotherapy, are especially susceptible to severe and life-threatening infection.7 With the omicron variant predominant, Ukrainian surveillance data reported a 7-day moving average of 27 538 COVID-19 cases on Feb 23, 2022, 1 day before the invasion, representing an incidence rate of 63 cases per 100 000 people. Ukrainian oncologists acknowledge that the pandemic resulted in delays in cancer screening, early symptom evaluation, and timely detection of cancer resulting in later stage at diagnosis, more limited treatment options, and worse outcomes.8 The care of patients with COVID-19 was overshadowed by the urgent needs to treat wounded military and civilians. Mental health and psychosocial dimensions Even in peacetime, and in the absence of a global pandemic, patients with cancer face combined challenges of health consequences and emotional distress associated with cancer diagnosis and treatment, including frailty, pain, and fears of cancer recurrence and shortened life expectancy.","Kizub, Darya, Melnitchouk, Nelya, Beznosenko, Andriy, Shabat, Galyna, Semeniv, Solomiia, Nogueira, Leticia, Watson, Patricia J.; Berg, Kim, Trapido, Edward J.; Espinel, Zelde, Shultz, James M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/S1470-2045(22)00189-9","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Lancet Oncology; 23(5):579-583, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31225,""
"Mental health training needs of physicians in Bangladesh: Views from stakeholders","Bangladesh is a lower-middle-income country with a high burden of mental health conditions and inadequate health systems. Prior research in similar settings has found that training physicians in mental health literacy can contribute to reducing the mental health treatment gap and strengthening the mental health care pathway. This study explores the need for mental health training for physicians by gathering stakeholdersâ€™ perspectives and proposes recommendations for designing a mental training program in the context of Bangladesh. Key informant interviews were conducted among psychiatrists (nÂ =Â 9), and mental health entrepreneurs (nÂ =Â 7);one focus group discussion was conducted with psychologists (nÂ =Â 8);and one-on-one interviews were held with physician (nÂ =Â 17). Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, all interviews were conducted online, recorded and transcribed. Transcriptions were analyzed thematically, utilizing both an inductive and deductive approach. The data analysis from forty-one stakeholders generated three major themes and eight subthemes. Stakeholders perceived that the inadequate mental health system and low mental health awareness among physicians significantly contribute to the mental health treatment gaps. Stakeholders emphasized the need to include mental health training for physicians to increase skills related to identification and management of mental health conditions. Stakeholders suggested some basic components for the training content, feasible modalities to deliver the training, and implementation challenges. Recommendations included utilizing online training, ensuring interesting and practical content, and incorporating certification systems. At a systems level, stakeholders recommended including a mental health curriculum in undergraduate medical education, capacity building of other healthcare workers and increasing awareness at the policy level. There is clear agreement among stakeholders that implementing mental health training for physicians will promote universal health coverage and reduce the mental health treatment gap in Bangladesh. These findings can support creation of policies to strengthen the care pathway in countries with limited resources.","Koly, Kamrun Nahar, Christopher, Enryka, Ahmed, Shahriar, Baskin, Cleo, Saba, Jobaida, Islam, Md Saiful, Tariq, Mohammad Raihan, Alam, Syeda Fatema, Sultana, Mst Sadia, Mushtaq, Monzia, Ahmed, Helal Uddin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmmh.2022.100107","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Mental Health;: 100107, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31226,""
"Locating temporary waste treatment facilities in the cities to handle the explosive growth of HCWs during pandemics: A novel Grey-AHP-OCRA hybrid approach","The COVID-19 outbreak has not only put the community health at stake but, also the environmental health. Usually, the healthcare wastes (HCWs) are composed of 15-20% of the infectious wastes and the rest of the non-infectious wastes. But, during any communicable health outbreak like COVID-19, the whole HCWs coming from the infected people become contagious. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the infectious waste is not only limited to the hospitalsâ€™ premises, but also comes from the households, where COVID19 infected people are under home quarantine. Hence, keeping in mind the explosive growth in generation rates of infectious HCWs, the present study targets to expand the treatment and disposal capacity by installing temporary healthcare waste treatment facilities (HCWTFs). The study identifies ten criteria from the literature review and in consultation with the field experts, to evaluate the potential candidates for setting up temporary HCWTF during the health outbreaks. The study proposes a hybrid methodology based on grey analytical hierarchy process (G-AHP) and grey operational competitiveness rating analysis (grey-OCRA) for prioritizing the evaluation criteria and selecting the optimal temporary HCWTF location by considering the expertsâ€™ inputs, respectively. The stakeholders consider the â€˜proximity to the inhabitationâ€™, â€˜infrastructure availabilityâ€™, and â€˜transportation distanceâ€™ are the most important criteria for selecting the temporary HCWTF location. The proposed methodology is applied to select the temporary HCWTF location in Sundargarh District, Odisha, India. The study identifies the four locations by using geographical information system (GIS) tools and sequences them as per the preferences given by the stakeholders on various identified criteria. The study may be useful for the administration to set up the temporary facilities to quickly dispose of the extra HCWs during the pandemics. However, the future studies can be targeted to coordinate the collection, storage and transportation activities with the temporary HCWTFs.","Thakur, Dr Vikas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2022.103907","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainable Cities and Society;: 103907, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31227,""
"Impact des manifestations respiratoires du lupus Ã©rythÃ©mateux dissÃ©minÃ© sur la qualitÃ© de vie et lâ€™Ã©tat psychologique des patients lors de la pandÃ©mie du COVID19","Introduction Les manifestations respiratoires sont prÃ©sentes chez 15% Ã  40% des patients atteints de lupus Ã©rythÃ©mateux dissÃ©minÃ© (LED), mais leur prÃ©sence au cours de la pandÃ©mie du COVID19, qui est une maladie respiratoire redoutable dans le monde entier, pourrait avoir un impact plus important sur la qualitÃ© de vie et lâ€™Ã©tat de santÃ© psychologique des patients. L'objectif principal de notre travail Ã©tait dâ€™Ã©valuer l'impact des manifestations respiratoires du lupus sur la qualitÃ© de vie et le niveau de l'anxiÃ©tÃ© et de la dÃ©pression chez les patients au cours de la pandÃ©mie du COVID19. Methodes Il s'agit d'une Ã©tude transversale, rÃ©alisÃ©e au service de mÃ©decine interne au CHU Hassan II de FÃ¨s au cours de la pandÃ©mie du COVID19. Les patients Ã©ligibles et ayant acceptÃ© de participer ont signÃ© un consentement Ã©crit pour rÃ©pondre Ã  un questionnaire contenant des informations sur leurs donnÃ©es sociodÃ©mographiques et mÃ©dicales. L'anxiÃ©tÃ© et la dÃ©pression ont Ã©tÃ© mesurÃ©es Ã  l'aide de lâ€™Ã©chelle HADs (Hospital anxiety and depression scale) qui comporte 14 items notÃ©s de 0 Ã  3 chacun. Sept questions portent sur l'anxiÃ©tÃ© et sept autres portent sur la dimension dÃ©pressive. Pour chaque dimension, un score = 8 signifie la prÃ©sence du trouble. Alors que la qualitÃ© de vie a Ã©tÃ© Ã©valuÃ©e Ã  l'aide de lâ€™Ã©chelle SF12 qui comporte 12 questions permettant dâ€™Ã©tablir un score de qualitÃ© de vie mentale et un score de qualitÃ© de vie physique qui sont des scores sur 100. Un score Ã©levÃ© correspond Ã  une meilleure qualitÃ© de vie. Pour dÃ©crire les caractÃ©ristiques de nos patients, on a prÃ©sentÃ© les variables catÃ©gorielles en nombre et en pourcentage alors que les variables quantitatives ont Ã©tÃ© rapportÃ©es sous forme de moyenne Â± Ã©cart-type.

"Teachersâ€™ emotional well-being during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with long school closures: A large-scale cross-sectional survey in Northern Italy","Objectives This study aimed to evaluate the magnitude of emotional burden on teaching staff during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in a significantly impacted region. In addition, the correlates of emotional burden were analysed to enable the design of targeted interventions. Study design Cross-sectional survey. Methods An electronic survey was administered to the teaching staff at public schools and kindergartens in a specific geographical area. Cross-sectional assessments of pandemic-specific variables were performed using the Pandemic Fatigue Scale (PFS), the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)-21, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). DASS-21 results were compared with results from a parallel survey that was representative of the local general population. Results In total, 3251 teaching staff members participated in the survey. Teachers showed a higher emotional burden for depression, anxiety and stress than the general population during the pandemic. According to a linear regression model, this burden is correlated with the language in which the questionnaires where answered, mistrust towards institutions, specific SARS-CoV-2 anxiety, past infection with SARS-CoV-2, avoidance of information about the pandemic and pandemic fatigue;emotional burden was negatively correlated with measures for life satisfaction, resilience and team atmosphere. Some independent variables were shown to contribute differentially to the variance of depression, anxiety or stress. Conclusions Emotional distress during the pandemic among teachers is higher than the general population and correlates with variables that could, at least in principle, be targeted for specific interventions.","Keim, Roland, Pfitscher, Gernot, Leitner, Sophie, Burger, Katharina, Giacomoni, Francesca, Wiedermann, Christian","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.04.006","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31230,""

"Critical Care Nurse Burnout, Moral Distress, and Mental Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A United States Survey","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has and will continue to have a tremendous influence on intensive care unit (ICU) nursesâ€™ mental health. Objectives The purpose of this study was to describe the impact of COVID-19 on nurse moral distress, burnout, and mental health. Methods Between October 2020 and January 2021 this descriptive study recruited a national sample of nurses who worked in the ICU during the COVID-19 pandemic through American Association of Critical Care Nurses newsletters and social media. Results A total of 488 survey responses were received from critical care nurses working in the U.S. during the COVID pandemic. Over two thirds of respondents experienced a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Nurse respondents reported moderate/high levels of moral distress and burnout. Symptoms of moderate to severe depression and anxiety were reported by 44.6% and 31.1% of respondents, respectively. Forty-seven percent of respondents were at risk for having posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Lack of perceived support from administration and shortage of PPE were associated with higher levels of burnout, moral distress, and PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Respondents had higher anxiety and depression than the general population and higher risk for having PTSD than recent veterans or patients after traumatic injury. High levels of reported burnout and moral distress increase the risk of nurses leaving ICU practice or the profession. This study offers important insights about the mental health of nurses during a global pandemic that can guide the development of customized interventions for ICU nurses related to this health care crisis.","Guttormson, Jill L.; Calkins, Kelly, McAndrew, Natalie, Fitzgerald, Jacklynn, Losurdo, Holly, Loonsfoot, Danielle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hrtlng.2022.04.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Heart & Lung;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31234,""
"Mobile and Wearable Sensors for Data-driven Health Monitoring System: State-of-the-Art and Future Prospect","Mobile and wearable devices embedded with multiple sensors for health monitoring and disease diagnosis are growing fields with the potential to provide efficient means for remote health management. A sensor-based health monitoring system offers an essential mechanism for real-time diagnosis and management to detect/predict, recommend treatment and prevent the onset of diseases. This paper aims to synthesize the research efforts on mobile and wearable sensors for health monitoring. It will investigate sensors, components of health monitoring systems, major application areas, challenges, and solutions faced during the implementation of health monitoring systems by researchers and practitioners. It was observed that sensors embedded in mobile and wearable devices for health monitoring are broadly categorized into homogeneous, dual, and heterogeneous sensors. In health monitoring, heterogeneous sensor-based is widely implemented and the most effective due to its ability to combine multiple sensors from various domains. The fusion of multiple sensors provides reliability, credibility, and better accuracy for monitoring multiple health parameters. We observed that researchers follow established procedures such as data collection, data transmission, preprocessing, feature extraction and development, data analysis, and evaluation of different algorithms for implementation of the health monitoring system. Supervised machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, and deep learning methods were the most implemented methods, while accuracy was the favored evaluation measure for health monitoring. Generally, we found that a health monitoring system is implemented to resolve health issues in the areas of human activity and posture monitoring, sleep disorder, sleep stage detection, fall monitoring in the elderly, depression, and mood swing detection. Other important areas include Parkinsonâ€™s disease management, cardiac diseases monitoring, disease diagnosis, and well-being, and Corona virus detection and contact tracing to minimize infection rate. Furthermore, the review succinctly highlights various challenges impeding the development of sensor-based health monitoring systems with significant solutions that were recommended in the literature to ameliorate these challenges discussed. From the review, it can be acknowledged that various research efforts have been conducted to develop effective health monitoring systems, and many new systems have been implemented. However, there is still much work to be done which we have also discussed under future prospects.","Virginia Anikwe, Chioma, Friday Nweke, Henry, Chukwu Ikegwu, Anayo, Adolphus Egwuonwu, Chukwunonso, Uchenna Onu, Fergus, Rita Alo, Uzoma, Wah Teh, Ying","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2022.117362","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Expert Systems with Applications;: 117362, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31235,""
"Perceived Impacts of COVID-19 on Wellbeing among US Working-Age Adults with ADL Difficulty","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted people with disabilities. Working-age adults with ADL difficulty may face unique challenges and heightened health risks because of the pandemic. It is critical to better understand COVID-19â€™s impacts on social, financial, physical, and mental wellbeing among people with disabilities to inform more inclusive pandemic response policies. Objective This study compares perceived COVID-19 physical and mental health, social, and financial impacts for U.S. working-age adults with and without ADL difficulty. Methods We analyzed data from a national survey of U.S. working-age adults (ages 18-64) conducted in February and March 2021 (N=3,697). We used logistic regression to compare perceived COVID-19-related impacts on physical and mental health, health care access, social relationships, and financial wellbeing among those with and without ADL difficulty. Results Adults with ADL difficulty were more likely to report negative COVID-19 impacts for many but not all outcomes. Net of covariates, adults with ADL difficulty had significantly greater odds of reporting COVID-19 infection (OR=2.1) and hospitalization (OR=6.7), negative physical health impacts (OR=2.0), and negative impacts to family relationships (OR=1.6). However, they had significantly lower odds of losing a friend or family member to COVID-19 (OR=0.7). There were no significant differences in perceived impacts on mental health, ability to see a doctor, relationships with friends, or financial wellbeing.

"Psychological distress among healthcare workers accessing occupational health services during the COVID-19 pandemic in Zimbabwe","Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) have experienced anxiety and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. We established and report findings from an occupational health programme for HCWs in Zimbabwe that offered screening for SARS-CoV-2 with integrated screening for comorbidities including common mental disorder (CMD) and referral for counselling. Methods Quantitative outcomes were fearfulness about COVID-19, the Shona Symptom Questionnaire (SSQ-14) score (cutpoint 8/14) and the number and proportion of HCWs offered referral for counselling, accepting referral and counselled. We used chi square tests to identify factors associated with fearfulness, and logistic regression was used to model the association of fearfulness with wave, adjusting for variables identified using a DAG. Qualitative data included 18 in-depth interviews, two workshops conducted with HCWs and written feedback from counsellors, analysed concurrently with data collection using thematic analysis. Results Between 27 July 2020â€“31 July 2021, spanning three SARS-CoV-2 waves, the occupational health programme was accessed by 3577 HCWs from 22 facilities. The median age was 37 (IQR 30â€“43) years, 81.9% were women, 41.7% said they felt fearful about COVID-19 and 12.1% had an SSQ-14 scoreÂ =Â 8. A total of 501 HCWs were offered referral for counselling, 78.4% accepted and 68.9% had =1 counselling session. Adjusting for setting and role, wave 2 was associated with increased fearfulness over wave 1 (ORÂ =Â 1.26, 95% CI 1.00â€“1.60). Qualitative data showed high levels of anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms and burnout related to the pandemic. Mental wellbeing was affected by financial insecurity, unmet physical health needs and inability to provide quality care within a fragile health system. Conclusions HCWs in Zimbabwe experience a high burden of mental health symptoms, intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustainable mental health interventions must be multisectoral addressing mental, physical and financial wellbeing.","Chingono, Rudo M.

"Role of social determinants in anxiety and depression symptoms during COVID-19: A longitudinal study of adults in North Carolina and Massachusetts","Trajectory studies of the COVID-19 pandemic have described patterns of symptoms over time. Yet, few have examined whether social determinants of health predict the progression of depression and anxiety symptoms during COVID-19 or identified which social determinants worsen symptom trajectories. Using a sample of racially/ethnically and linguistically diverse adults participating in a randomized clinical trial with pre-existing moderate to severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms, we compare symptom patterns before and during COVID-19;characterize symptom trajectories over a 20-week follow-up period;and evaluate whether social determinants are associated with within and between person differences in symptom trajectories. Data were collected before and during COVID-19 in Massachusetts and North Carolina. On average, depression and anxiety symptoms did not seem to worsen during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic. During COVID-19, anxiety scores at follow-up were higher for participants with baseline food insecurity (vs no food insecurity). Depression scores at follow-up were higher for participants with food insecurity and for those with utilities insecurity (vs no insecurity). Participants with child or family care responsibilities at baseline had depression symptoms decreasing at a slower rate over time than those without these responsibilities. We discuss the important implications of these findings.","AlegrÃ­a, Margarita, Cruz-Gonzalez, Mario, O'Malley, Isabel Shaheen, Alvarez, Kiara, Stein, Gabriela Livas, Fuentes, Larimar, Eddington, Kari, Poindexter, Claire, Markle, Sheri Lapatin, Thorndike, Anne N.; Zhang, Lulu, Shrout, Patrick E.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2022.104102","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Behaviour Research and Therapy;: 104102, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31238,""
"Randomized clinical trial of integral cognitive remediation program for major depression","Despite achieving clinical remission, patients with depression encounter difficulties to return to their premorbid psychosocial functioning. Cognitive dysfunction has been proposed to be a primary mediator of functional impairment. Therefore, the new non-pharmacological procognitive strategy INtegral Cognitive REMediation for Depression (INCREM) has been developed with the aim of targeting cognitive and psychosocial functioning. This is a single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial with three treatment arms. Fifty-two depressed patients in clinical remission, with psychosocial difficulties and cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to receive INCREM intervention, Psychoeducation programme, or treatment as usual. Patients were assessed before and after the study period, and six months after. The primary outcome was the change from baseline of patients' psychosocial functioning. Changes in cognitive functioning and other variables were considered secondary outcomes. The analysis showed a significant improvement in psychosocial functioning in the INCREM group, especially six months after the intervention, compared to patients who received the psychoeducation programme. An improvement in cognitive performance was also observed in the INCREM group. This study includes a small sample size due to the anticipated end of the clinical trial because of the COVID-19 pandemic. These results provide preliminary evidence on the feasibility and potential efficacy of the INCREM program to improve not only cognitive performance but also psychosocial functioning in clinically remitted depressed patients, and such improvement is maintained six months after. It can be speculated that the maintenance is mediated by the cognitive enhancement achieved with INCREM.","Vicent-Gil, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Simarro, RaventÃƒÂ³s, Vera, MarÃƒÂ­n MartÃƒÂ­nez, SabatÃƒÂ©-Cao, PÃƒÂ©rez-Blanco, Puigdemont, de Diego-AdeliÃƒÂ±o, Alemany, Serra-Blasco, Cardoner, Portella","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.05.016","20220511","Cognitive remediation; Computerized cognitive training; Depression; Functional remediation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31239,""
"Association between workplace and mental health and its mechanisms during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional, population-based, multi-country study","The COVID-19 pandemic worsens populations' mental health. However, little is known about the COVID-19-related mental health among remote workers. We retrieved data from survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, covering 27 countries. Eligible people were those employed. The main outcome is the mental disorder, covering four aspects: depression, anxiety, sleep disorder, and loneliness. Country-specific weighted mixed models were fitted to estimate the association of workplaces with mental health, controlled for age, gender, education level, living alone, making ends meets, working hours, closing to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, received anti-virus protection, social contact, disability, and chronic disease. Moderate analyses were conducted to explore possible mechanisms. 11,197 participants were included, among them 29.3% suffered at least one worse mental disorder. After controlling for covariates, compared with those who worked at the usual workplace, those who worked at home only or part of the time did not associate with worse mental disorders (p-value Ã¢â€°Â¥0.1395), and those who worked at neither the usual workplace nor home had a 55% higher likelihood of suffering from worse mental disorders (ORÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯1.55, 95%CI 1.03-2.36). The mediation analyses identified three indirect pathways by which workplaces influence mental health, including making ends meets, social contact, and receiving anti-virus protection. Detailed results on subtypes of mental disorders were also provided. All assessments were self-reported, resulting in a risk of method bias. During the COVID-19 pandemic, working at other places, neither at the usual workplace nor home, worsened mental health.

"STATUS OF WEIGHT CHANGE, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND DIABETES MELLITUS IN A COHORT WITH OBESITY DURING THE COVID 19 LOCKDOWNTURK-COM STUDY GROUP","The COVID-19 pandemic led to a lockdown period. Confinement periods have been related to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors. Our study aimed to determine weight change, changes in eating and exercise habits, the presence of depression and anxiety, and diabetes mellitus (DM) status in a cohort of patients with obesity. The study was undertaken in nine centers of Collaborative Obesity Management (COM) of the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) in Turkey. An e-survey about weight change, eating habits, physical activity status, DM status, depression, and anxiety was completed by patients. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) score was used to determine physical activity in terms of metabolic equivalents (METs). A healthy nutrition coefficient was calculated from the different categories of food consumption. The Patient Health Questionaire (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) were used for determining depression and anxiety, respectively. Four hundred twenty-two patients (age 45Ã‚Â±12.7 years, W/M=350/72) were included. The healthy nutrition coefficient before the pandemic was 38.9Ã‚Â±6.2 and decreased to 38.1Ã‚Â±6.4 during the pandemic (p&lt;0.001). Two hundred twenty-nine (54.8%) patients gained weight, 54 (12.9%) were weight neutral, and 135 (32.3%) lost weight. Patients in the weight loss group had higher MET scores and higher healthy nutrition coefficients compared with the weight gain and weight-neutral groups (p&lt;0.001). The PHQ and GAD scores were not different between the groups. Percent weight loss was related to healthy nutrition coefficientÃ£â‚¬Ë†CI: 0.884 (0.821-0.951), p=0.001Ã£â‚¬â€° and MET categories Ã£â‚¬Ë†CI: 0.408 (0.222-0.748), p=0.004Ã£â‚¬â€°. One hundred seventy patients had DM. Considering glycemic control, only 12 (8.4%) had fasting blood glucose &lt;100 mg/dL and 36 (25.2%) had postprandial BG &lt;160 mg/dL. When patients with and without DM were compared in terms of dietary compliance, MET category, weight loss status, PHQ scores, and GAD scores, only MET categories were different; 29 (11.7%) of patients in the nondiabetic group were in the highly active group compared with 5 (2.9%) in the diabetic group. The COVID-19 lockdown resulted in weight gain in about half of our patients, which was related to changes in physical activity and eating habits. Patients with DM who had moderate glycemic control were similar to the general population in terms of weight loss but were less active.","YazÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±, FersahoÃ„Å¸lu, FersahoÃ„Å¸lu, Bulut, Ãƒâ€¡iÃ„Å¸iltepe, Ãƒâ€¡eler, Sancak, Sulu, Durcan, Ã…Å¾ahin, Polat Korkmaz, BozdoÃ„Å¸an Polat, Taskin, Ã„Â°Ã…Å¸eri, GÃƒÂ¼rsoy, KÃƒÂ¼ÃƒÂ§ÃƒÂ¼k Yetgin, Kaya, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, MestanoÃ„Å¸lu Ã„Â°stanbullu, KÃ„Â±yÃ„Â±cÃ„Â±, Ãƒâ€“ztÃƒÂ¼rk, GÃƒÂ¼ngÃƒÂ¶r, Can, SargÃ„Â±n, Tabak, Averi, NazlÃ„Â±, Polat, Akbas, Tekin, TopaloÃ„Å¸lu, Boz UzaldÃ„Â±, Ãƒâ€¡atalÃƒÂ§am, BayraktaroÃ„Å¸lu, Ãƒâ€¡alÃ„Â±koÃ„Å¸lu, Nasifova, Soyluk SelÃƒÂ§ukbiricik, KarÃ…Å¸Ã„Â±daÃ„Å¸, Sezer, Ãƒâ€“zÃ„Â±Ã…Å¸Ã„Â±k, Bulut, Bekdemir, Deyneli, DinÃƒÂ§er, Gogas Yavuz, Ilkova, Yumuk","https://doi.org/10.1159/000522658","20220511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31241,""

This study aimed to verify the prevalence of current major depressive episode (CMDE) in mothers of preschoolers (up to five years old) and its associated stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic in a municipality in the Southern Brazil. This is a cross-sectional, population-based study with mothers. All mothers were interviewed by telephone call during the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I. Plus) to assess the presence of CMDE. Statistical analysis was conducted using the chi-square test and a multivariate logistic regression. We evaluated 666 mothers. The prevalence of CMDE was 12.3%. Mothers with financial losses had 2.1 (95%CI: 1.3-3.4) more odds of presenting CMDE than those financially stable.

"A person-centred approach to COVID-19 pandemic-related stressors","The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant containment effects has had a detrimental effect on individuals' social, occupational and financial circumstances. Taking a person-centred approach to inquiry and data analysis, we sought to identify classes (or segments) of employees with distinct configurations of responses across several pandemic-related stressors. We also investigated purported risk and resilience factors of membership in these classes. We analyzed data from 4277 employees who completed a pulse survey in August 2020, using latent class analysis to identify classes of employees with unique patterns of responses across six pandemic-related stressors. We also conducted a multinomial logistic regression analysis to explore the associations between several risk and resilience factors (e.g. age, gender, perceived organizational support) and class membership, and we compared the emergent classes' levels of self-reported mental health. The data revealed four unique classes of employees: ""adapting,"" ""conflicted,"" ""insecure"" and "" stressed"" (30%, 35%, 21% and 14% of the sample, respectively). All of the risk and resilience factors were associated with being in the adapting class versus the other classes. The adapting employees also showed the most positive self-reported mental health relative to their counterparts. By identifying classes of employees with distinct configurations of pandemic-related stressors, as well as differential risk factors and levels of self-reported mental health, the present study offers a starting point for informing work-related interventions with the goal of helping employees most vulnerable to pandemic-related stressors effectively cope with these stressors.

Several risk factors (i.e. being younger, being a woman, being a visible minority) were related to employeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s responses to stressors. Conversely, perceived organizational support emerged as a reliable promotive factor that appears to counteract exposure to risk.

"Strengthening the Impact of Digital Cognitive Behavioral Interventions Through a Dual Intervention: Proficient Motivational Interviewing-Based Health Coaching Plus In-Application Techniques","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of digital tools to support individuals struggling with their mental health. The use of a digital intervention plus human coaching (""dual"" intervention) is gaining momentum in increasing overall engagement in digital cognitive behavioral interventions (dCBIs). However, there is limited insight into the methodologies and coaching models used by those deploying dual interventions. To achieve a deeper understanding, we need to identify and promote effective engagement that leads to clinical outcomes versus simply monitoring engagement metrics. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a collaborative, goal-oriented communication approach that pays particular attention to the language of change and is an effective engagement approach to help people manage mental health issues. However, this approach has been traditionally used for in-person or telephonic interventions, and less is known about the application of MI to digital interventions. We sought to provide a dual intervention approach and address multiple factors across two levels of engagement to operationalize a dCBI that combined cognitive behavioral therapy-based techniques and MI-based interactions between the digital health coach (DHC) and user. We reviewed hundreds of digital exchanges between DHCs and users to identify and improve training and quality assurance activities for digital interventions. We tested five hypotheses and found that: (1) users of a dual digital behavioral health intervention had greater engagement levels than users of a noncoached intervention (P&lt;.001); (2) DHCs with a demonstrated competency in applying MI to digital messages had more engaged users, as measured by the DHC-to-user message exchange ratio (P&lt;.001); (3) the DHC-to-user message exchange ratio was correlated with more engagement in app activities (r=0.28, 95% CI 0.23-0.33); (4) DHCs with demonstrated MI proficiency elicited a greater amount of ""change talk"" from users than did DHCs without MI proficiency (H=25.12, P&lt;.001); and (5) users who were engaged by DHCs with MI proficiency had better clinical outcomes compared to users engaged by DHCs without MI proficiency (P=.02). To our knowledge, this pilot was the first of its kind to test the application of MI to digital coaching protocols, and it demonstrated the value of MI proficiency in digital health coaching for enhanced engagement and health improvement. Further research is needed to establish coaching models in dCBIs that incorporate MI to promote effective engagement and optimize positive behavioral outcomes.","Serio, Gabarda, Uyar-Morency, Silfee, Ludwig, Szigethy, Butterworth","https://doi.org/10.2196/34552","20220511","COVID-19; cognitive behavioral therapy; digital health; mHealth; mental health; motivational interviewing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31245,""
"Neuropsychiatric Ramifications of Severe COVID-19 and Other Severe Acute Respiratory Infections","Individuals surviving severe COVID-19 may be at increased risk of neuropsychiatric sequelae. Robust assessment of these risks may help improve clinical understanding of the post-COVID syndrome, aid clinical care during the ongoing pandemic, and inform postpandemic planning. To quantify the risks of new-onset neuropsychiatric conditions and new neuropsychiatric medication prescriptions after discharge from a COVID-19-related hospitalization, and to compare these with risks after discharge from hospitalization for other severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cohort study, adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years of age) were identified from QResearch primary care and linked electronic health record databases, including national SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital episode statistics, intensive care admissions data, and mortality registers in England, from January 24, 2020, to July 7, 2021. COVID-19-related or SARI-related hospital admission (including intensive care admission). New-onset diagnoses of neuropsychiatric conditions (anxiety, dementia, psychosis, depression, bipolar disorder) or first prescription for relevant medications (antidepressants, hypnotics/anxiolytics, antipsychotics) during 12 months of follow-up from hospital discharge. Maximally adjusted hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CIs were estimated using flexible parametric survival models. In this cohort study of data from 8.38 million adults (4.18 million women, 4.20 million men; mean [SD] age 49.18 [18.45] years); 16Ã¢â‚¬Â¯679 (0.02%) survived a hospital admission for SARI, and 32Ã¢â‚¬Â¯525 (0.03%) survived a hospital admission for COVID-19. Compared with the remaining population, survivors of SARI and COVID-19 hospitalization had higher risks of subsequent neuropsychiatric diagnoses. For example, the HR for anxiety in survivors of SARI was 1.86 (95% CI, 1.56-2.21) and for survivors of COVID-19 infection was 2.36 (95% CI, 2.03-2.74); the HR for dementia for survivors of SARI was 2.55 (95% CI, 2.17-3.00) and for survivors of COVID-19 infection was 2.63 (95% CI, 2.21-3.14). Similar findings were observed for all medications analyzed; for example, the HR for first prescriptions of antidepressants in survivors of SARI was 2.55 (95% CI, 2.24-2.90) and for survivors of COVID-19 infection was 3.24 (95% CI, 2.91-3.61). There were no significant differences observed when directly comparing the COVID-19 group with the SARI group apart from a lower risk of antipsychotic prescriptions in the former (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.69-0.92). In this cohort study, the neuropsychiatric sequelae of severe COVID-19 infection were found to be similar to those for other SARI. This finding may inform postdischarge support for people surviving SARI.","Clift, Ranger, Patone, Coupland, Hatch, Thomas, Hippisley-Cox, Watkinson","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.1067","20220511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31246,""
"Admissions of Children and Adolescents With Deliberate Self-harm to Intensive Care During the SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Australia","Identification of potential indirect outcomes associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in the pediatric population may be essential for understanding the challenges of the current global public health crisis for children and adolescents. To investigate whether the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and subsequent effective public health measures in Australia were associated with an increase in admissions to intensive care units (ICUs) of children and adolescents with deliberate self-harm (DSH). This national, multicenter cohort study was conducted using the Australian data subset of the binational Australian and New Zealand Paediatric Intensive Care registry, a collaborative containing more than 200Ã¢â‚¬Â¯000 medical records with continuous contributions from all 8 Australian specialist, university-affiliated pediatric ICUs, along with 1 combined neonatal-pediatric ICU and 14 general (adult) ICUs in Australia. The study period encompassed 6.5 years from January 1, 2015, to June 30, 2021. Patients aged 12 to 17 years were included. Data were analyzed from December 2021 through February 2022. Any of the following admission diagnoses: ingestion of a drug, ingestion of a nondrug, hanging or strangulation, or self-injury. The primary outcome measure was the temporal trend for national incidence of DSH ICU admissions per 1 million children and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in Australia. A total of 813 children and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years admitted to ICUs with DSH were identified among 64Ã¢â‚¬Â¯145 patients aged 0 to 17 years in the Australian subset of the registry during the study period. Median (IQR) age was 15.1 (14.3-15.8) years; there were 550 (67.7%) female patients, 261 (32.2%) male patients, and 2 (0.2%) patients with indeterminate sex. At the onset of the pandemic, monthly incidence of DSH ICU admissions per million children and adolescents increased from 7.2 admissions in March 2020 to a peak of 11.4 admissions by August 2020, constituting a significant break in the temporal trend (odds ratio of DSH ICU admissions on or after vs before March 2020, 4.84; 95% CI, 1.09 to 21.53; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.04). This occurred while the rate of all-cause admissions to pediatric ICUs of children and adolescents of all ages (ie, ages 0-17 years) per 1 million children and adolescents decreased from a long-term monthly median (IQR) of 150.9 (138.1-159.8) admissions to 91.7 admissions in April 2020. This cohort study found that the coronavirus pandemic in Australia was associated with a significant increase in admissions of children and adolescents to intensive care with DSH.","Corrigan, Duke, Millar, Paul, Butt, Gordon, Coleman, Pilcher, Oberender, Ganeshalingam, Sherring, Erickson, Barr, Raman, Long, Schlapbach, Gibbons, George, Singh, Smith, Delzoppo, Gelbart, Ganu, Letton, Festa, Harper, Alexander, Pellegrini","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.11692","20220511","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31247,""

"Racism and the mental health of East Asian diasporas in North America: a scoping review","The COVID-19 pandemic heightened anti-Asian racism towards East Asian diasporas in North America. Experiences of racism encountered by East Asian communities have been documented to negatively impact their mental health. A scoping review was undertaken following Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) methodology to (a) map the foci of literature on racism and the mental health of East Asian diasporas in North America and (b) identify gaps in the current literature. A total of 1309 articles were identified in May 2021. Based on the inclusion criteria, 35 records were included. Two distinct mental health foci were found: mental health outcomes and mental healthcare access and utilization. The majority (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22) of the articles focused on racism at the interpersonal level. Six articles provided anti-racism solutions at the individual level, such as overcoming biases. Five articles targeted anti-racism solutions from both the individual and institutional levels, while 1 article addressed barriers at the institutional level, such as dismantling sanctioned power hierarchies. The expanding knowledge base on COVID-19-related racial discrimination is reminiscent of previous literature examining the history of anti-Asian racism in North America.

"High recurrence of lymphedema and influencing factors in discharged breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicenter, cross-sectional survey","There has been a delay in the detection and treatment of lymphedema in breast cancer patients during the lockdown owing to quarantine and limited social activity. Moreover, this scenario has caused psychosocial issues in these patients. Given that there is scarce information on the prevalence and influence of lymphedema during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of lymphedema recurrence and its influencing factors among discharged breast cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional, hospital-based survey of discharged breast cancer patients was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in eight first-class hospitals in Wuhan, China. The Norman Questionnaire was used to assess lymphedema. Univariable and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors influencing moderate or severe lymphedema. Differences in living characteristics, anxiety, and depression were compared between the no/mild lymphedema group and the moderate/severe lymphedema groups. Preferences for lymphedema management during the pandemic were determined. Overall, 202 patients were included in this study, and 191 of them reported recurrent lymphedema (prevalence: 94.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 90.5% to 97.3%). Among them, 134 and 57 had mild and moderate/severe lymphedema, respectively. In 191 patients, the main symptoms were swelling (140; 69.3%) and pain (56, 27.7%). Multivariable regression showed that older age (odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02-1.10), radical surgery (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 4.35, 95% CI: 1.54-12.50), and fully complete radiotherapy (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.62, 95% CI: 1.17-5.87, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.019) were associated with an elevated risk of moderate/severe lymphedema. The moderate/severe lymphedema group experienced a higher rate of anxiety and depression than the no/mild lymphedema group did. Patients equally preferred treatment in the hospital and self-care at home. During the COVID-19 pandemic, high prevalence of lymphedema was observed in patients Age, radical surgery and fully completed radiotherapy were associated with increased risk of severer lymphedema. Meanwhile, the patients with severe lymphedema experienced psychological distress. While the Covid-19 pandemic was still raging, continuous efforts should be made to identify patient at risk of lymphedema and distribute feasible guidance and education for self-management in lymphedema.","Peng, Chen, Rao, Yang, Yan, Xia, Wang, Wang, Lu, Pan, Liu, Cheng, He","https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4737","20220511","COVID-19; PROs; breast cancer; lymphedema; norman Questionnaire","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31250,""
"Addressing the Experiences of Family Caregivers of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Finland","This cross-sectional study assessed the experiences of family caregivers of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited (<i>n</i> = 101) between April and December 2019. We applied a mixed-method approach. Quantitative data were analyzed using an independent samples t-test and logistic regression analysis, and qualitative experiences with modified thematic content analysis. The mean age of the family caregivers was 76 years (<i>SD</i> = 7), and 72% were females. Experiences of loneliness and worry during the pandemic were evaluated by self-assessment. Approximately one-third of the participants reported loneliness and worry. These experiences were further associated with female sex, increased psychological distress and depressive symptoms, and decreased physical condition and social relationships. Family caregivers were also worried about the pandemic's impact on health and well-being. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has added an extra psychosocial load to family caregivers.

"Neuropsychiatric symptoms in post COVID-19 long haulers","Long haulers have been recently reported after contracting coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In the present study, we aimed to screen for the neuropsychiatric signs detected &lt;1 to &gt;6 months after infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to determine whether vaccination has an effect on them. An online survey was conducted among participants who had been diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The clinical signs and durations of neuropsychiatric complaints and their correlations to sex, age, severity of COVID-19 signs, and vaccination status were screened. A total of 2218 individuals, including 1358 females and 860 males, with an age range of 12-70 years, submitted their responses. The respondents experienced cognitive dysfunction, mood alteration, depression, tinnitus, sleep disorders, and loss of taste and smell, with prevalence rates ranging from 18.9% (tinnitus) to 63.9% (loss of taste and smell). Of the respondents, 2.2-7.7% of confirmed the persistence of symptoms for &gt;6 months. Tinnitus was the least common complaint, and only 2.2% of the study participants had tinnitus for &gt;6 months. Meanwhile, mood alteration persisted for &gt;6 months in 7.6% of the study participants.

"Alzheimer's Disease Prevention Health Coaching","Widespread lifestyle risk reduction at the community level is considered effective in decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD). To address the limited use of risk deduction in AD, this study aimed to explore the feasibility of community-level implementation. Diverse older adults (60+) living in Richmond, VA, with incomes below $12,000/year and managing diabetic/cardiovascular symptoms were offered weekly lifestyle telephone-health coaching for 12-weeks in 2019-2020 (Phase 1). The health coaching sessions were framed to provide AD lifestyle risk reduction education, goal setting, and support: motivations and self-efficacy. The study sample (n=40, mean age 68 years (range: 60-76 years)) was 90% African American/Black (n=36), 100% Non-Hispanic, and 45% males (n=18). Twenty-five participants (60%) reported experiencing some/often memory problems in the last 12-months. Thirty-nine (95%) of subjects successfully participated in coaching sessions; on average, 11 (91.9%) sessions per subject were completed. Participants provided positive anecdotal feedback and stated the need for continued health coaching. Consequently, n=30 (75%) of the original sample consented to continued health coaching during the 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic (Phase 2). All study subjects were examined at baseline (Time 1), 3-month (Time 2), covid-baseline (Time 3), and 3-months postcovid-baseline (Time 4). Repeated Measures ANOVAs were done to examine Time and Time*Memory Status effects. There was a total risk reduction at Phase 1 (F=9.26; p=.004; effect size=.19). At Phase 2, alcohol use decreased (p=.05), quadratic time effects were observed in physical activity (p=.01-.02), and cubic time effects were observed in depression (p=.02). Overall, total risk reduction in Phase 2 was observed at F=5.05; p=.03 effect size=.16. Pre/post-test analyses indicated improvement in Memory Problem Time Interaction (p=.007), AD knowledge (p=.01-.03), and Tired Days (p=.04) across Phase 1. There was also improvement in Social Isolation Time Interaction (p=.03); Tobacco Addiction (p=.001); Poor Mental Health Days (p=.05), and Worried Days Time Interaction (p=.02-.01) across Phase 2. Between subject Memory Status effects, indicating poorer baseline levels for individuals reporting memory problems had greater improvement seen in memory complaints (p=.001), poor mental health days (.02), and tired days (.003-.01). This preliminary work creates the impetus for future large-scale lifestyle AD risk reduction investigations to mitigate and improve modifiable AD risk among low-income, diverse older adults, including individuals reporting memory problems. Our findings surrounding participant engagement and positive trends in AD risk reduction support the hypothesis that telephone-based health coaching is a practical and feasible AD risk reduction intervention.","Rhodes, Inker, Richardson, Zanjani","https://doi.org/10.14283/jpad.2022.33","20220511","Alzheimer's disease; Covid; memory; minority health; risk reduction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31253,""
"Mining voices from self-expressed messages on social-media: Diagnostics of mental distress during COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on mankind, causing physical suffering and deaths across the globe. Even those who have not contracted the virus have experienced its far-reaching impacts, particularly on their mental health. The increased incidences of psychological problems, anxiety associated with the infection, social restrictions, economic downturn, etc., are likely to aggravate with the virus spread and leave a longer impact on humankind. These reasons in aggregation have raised concerns on mental health and created a need to identify novel precursors of depression and suicidal tendencies during COVID-19. Identifying factors affecting mental health and causing suicidal ideation is of paramount importance for timely intervention and suicide prevention. This study, thus, bridges this gap by utilizing computational intelligence and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to unveil the factors underlying mental health issues. We observed that the pandemic and subsequent lockdown anxiety emerged as significant factors leading to poor mental health outcomes after the onset of COVID-19. Consistent with previous works, we found that psychological disorders have remained pre-eminent. Interestingly, financial burden was found to cause suicidal ideation before the pandemic, while it led to higher odds of depressive (non-suicidal) thoughts for individuals who lost their jobs. This study offers significant implications for health policy makers, governments, psychiatric practitioners, and psychologists.","Kumar, Mukherjee, Choi, Dhamotharan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dss.2022.113792","20220511","COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Natural language processing; Pandemic; Social-media; Suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31254,""

Multivariable linear regression examined correlates of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (index score of willingness and likelihood of being vaccinated), including sociopolitical factors (MSA, political orientation, COVID-related news exposure), COVID-19 symptoms and testing, mental health (e.g., COVID-related stress), and sociodemographics. 45.3% were ""extremely willing"" to get the vaccine (19.8% very, 14.2% somewhat, 3.7% don't know, 7.0% a little, 10.1% not at all); 40.2% were ""extremely likely"" to get vaccinated (22.1% very, 14.2% somewhat, 5.2% don't know, 7.9% a little, 10.3% not at all). Greater vaccine hesitancy was significantly related to living in specific MSAs (i.e., Atlanta, Oklahoma City, San Diego, Seattle vs. Minneapolis or Boston), identifying as Republican or ""no lean"" (vs. Democrat), and reporting less COVID-related news exposure and less COVID-related stress, as well as identifying as older, female, Black or other race, having less (vs. greater) than a college education, being married/cohabitating, and having children in the home.

"COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and political ideation among college students in Central New York: The influence of differential media choice","COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is context specific and highly dynamic in the United States. The objective of this study was to examine the underlying causes of COVID-19 vaccine use and hesitancy among students at two colleges in Central New York (USA) in order to better understand how to promote vaccination in this demographic. A Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs &amp; Behaviors survey was designed to measure the relationship between gender, political ideology, media consumption, beliefs, mental health and anxiety, and pandemic-related behaviors. The survey was distributed by email to students in April 2021. Of 8,894 eligible respondents, 627 students completed the survey. Structural Equation Modeling was utilized to explore both direct and indirect relationships. Modeling suggests that the effect of political ideology (being more conservative) is to promote the consumption of right wing news, which in turn tends to increase vaccine hesitancy. Conservative political ideology does not directly lead to vaccine hesitancy, but it does encourage the consumption of news from sources that promote fear and hesitation about the vaccines. News sources significantly contribute to vaccine attitudes among this demographic.","Lasher, Fulkerson, Seale, Thomas, Gadomski","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101810","20220511","COVID-19; College students; KABB, Knowledge, Attitudes, Beliefs &amp; Behaviors; Media; Misinformation; Right wing media; SEM, Structural Equation Modeling; Vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31257,""

"Social Media Use Early in the Pandemic Predicted Later Social Well-Being and Mental Health in a National Online Sample of Adults in the United States","Social media use increased early in the Covid-19 pandemic, but little information is available about its impact. The present study examined associations of frequency of use of different social media and the motives for use with subsequent social well-being and mental health. Data were gathered on a nationwide sample of 843 Americans during the first wave of lockdowns and infections in mid-April 2020, and again five weeks later. Participants were adults ages 20 to 88Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Controlling for age and gender, greater frequency of Facebook and video chat app use predicted higher levels social support but also higher levels of cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals and posttraumatic stress symptoms. Greater use of video chat apps also predicted less loneliness. Greater use of both Instagram and Snapchat predicted more anxiety and cumulative Covid-19-related stress appraisals. Greater use of Instagram also predicted higher levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Motives for use (e.g., connect with others, waste time/avoid responsibility, online video gaming with others) also differentially predicted social well-being and mental health. Results indicate that greater social media use early in the pandemic was often associated with more distress and lower levels of social well-being but, effects varied depending on types, frequency, and motivations for use. Overall, the study revealed that social media use related to social well-being and mental health in complex ways.","Awao, Park, Russell, Fendrich","https://doi.org/10.1080/08964289.2022.2069667","20220511","Covid-19; loneliness; mental health; social media use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31259,""
"Identifying Lockdown Relaxation Strategies and Policy Implications to Fight against COVID-19: Medical Experts Perspective from Pakistan","The COVID-19 pandemic, was first identified in Wuhan, China, has had a drastic effect on the world economy and compelled governments to enforce lockdown in territories. However, lockdown is destroying the world economy badly as well as the physical and mental health of people. Therefore, governments must develop Lockdown Relaxation Strategies (LRS) to overcome the negative consequences of lockdown in Pakistan. Identifying LRS is important for public health and economic restoration. Therefore, this work is an initial attempt to develop LRS in a developing country - Pakistan, and prioritize LRS through a novel ISM-MICMAC approach. By taking response from experts, results show that implementation of smart lockdowns in affected areas, meeting minimum criteria of public health standards, limited operations of public transportation are the most important strategies. Results provide a strategic guideline for governments to take necessary measures and allocate resources appropriately.","Iqbal, Ma, Ullah, Ahmad, Ibrahim, Waqas, Ahmad","https://doi.org/10.1080/19371918.2022.2066042","20220511","COVID-19; Developing countries; ISM-MICMAC; Lockdown relaxation strategies; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31260,""
"The impact of COVID-19 on long-term care facilities and their staff in Israel: Results from a mixed methods study","We examined the impact of COVID-19 regarding organizational and management issues at Israeli long-term care facilities. Residents in facilities were very vulnerable to significant disease and mortality during COVID-19. A survey of 52 facilities in Israel was conducted in 2020, consisting of closed- and open-ended questions. Mixed methods were used to analyze data both quantitively and qualitatively. Three main effects emerged: worsened financial status of long-term-care facilities resulting from high expenditures for preventive measures and reduced revenue due to deaths and fewer resident admissions; increased workload due to decreased workforce and additional duties; and negative mental health effects on staff because of increased workload and the conflict between maintaining good clinical practice and following COVID-19 regulations. The development of government directives needs to take into account potential conflicts between the directives and quality care principles and to provide a balanced approach that assures humane care. Facilities and their staff lacked adequate pandemic-related guidance and support. The results highlight the need to address staff shortages and training, to provide more support and clearer guidance to facilities and their staff, and to devise a framework and strategies for future health crises.","Cohen-Mansfield","https://doi.org/10.1111/jonm.13667","20220511","COVID-19; Nursing homes; pandemic; personal protective equipment; quality care; staff burn-out","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31261,""
"Mental health of Korean adults before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Special Report of the 2020 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","COVID-19 and the associated social distancing, limited freedom, and fear of an uncertain future are expected to have substantial mental health effects. We investigated mental health responses in the community during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Korea. We used the KNHANES(2016-2019) to assess pre-pandemic mental health status and the KNHANES 2020 survey data for the evaluation during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Mental health status was evaluated perceived severe stress, depression, and suicidal plans. All analyses were stratified by sex. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed according to age, employment condition, and household income. The percentage of Korean adults with suicidal plans increased significantly from 1.3%(95%CI: 1.1-1.5) in 2016-2019 to 1.8%(95%CI: 1.4-2.1) in 2020. In subgroup analyses, individuals in their 20s and 40s showed a marked increase in suicidal plans of 1.2%(95%CI: 0.0-2.3) and 0.9%(95%CI: 0.0-1.8) percentage points, respectively. In men, depression and perceived severe stress increased significantly from pre- to during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, there was a 2.4%(95%CI: 0.8-4.0) increase in depression among standard workers and a 2.9% increase in depression in individuals in the second highest quintile of household income from 2016 and 2018 to 2020. As COVID-19 continued, mental health issues such as suicidal plans, depression, and severe stress increased significantly in young men and people in the second highest quintile of household income. Proactive community mental health efforts are needed to prevent prolonged exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic from resulting in increases in the suicide rate.","Jeong, Park, Kim, Oh, Yim","https://doi.org/10.4178/epih.e2022042","20220511","COVID-19; Depression; KNHANES; Mental health; Stress; Suicide plans","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31262,""
"Youth mental health and/or addiction concerns and service needs during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative exploration of caregiver experiences and perspectives","The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly had a significant impact on youth mental health and/or addiction concerns and exacerbated pre-existing gaps in access to mental health and/or addiction care. Caregivers can support their youth in seeking and participating in care, however, their experiences in doing so in the pandemic and their perspectives of their youth's care needs are not well-understood. A descriptive qualitative study was conducted to better understand youth's and caregivers' experiences accessing care during the pandemic, from the caregivers' standpoint. Participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews that focused on experiences seeking and accessing mental health and/or addiction services, with specific questions regarding their experiences accessing services during the pandemic. A total of 46 interviews were included in the thematic analysis of the data. Study findings highlight the impacts of the pandemic on everyday life, on youth mental health and/or addiction needs, on caregiver's experiences seeking and accessing services for their youth, and on service access, including perceptions of virtual care modalities. The discussion highlights the importance of focusing on factors that enable youth's participation in care, to ensure accessibility of appropriate and timely care that meets youth's and families' needs. Also highlighted is the frustration and despair experienced by caregivers seeking critical mental health and addictions supports for their youth during the pandemic, as well as the sense of isolation and of being left behind by the system. Identifying caregiver perspectives of youth mental health and addiction needs and service access during the COVID-19 pandemic provided important insights that can help inform approaches to youth mental health and addictions care during the pandemic and beyond.","Markoulakis, Da Silva, Kodeeswaran, Levitt","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00471-0","20220510","COVID-19; Caregivers; Mental health services; Pandemic; Virtual care; Youth mental health and addictions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31263,""
"Experience of discrimination during COVID-19 pandemic: the impact of public health measures and psychological distress among refugees and other migrants in Europe","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a disproportionately hard impact on refugees and other migrants who are often exposed to the virus with limited means to protect themselves. We tested the hypothesis that during the COVID-19 pandemic, refugees and other migrants have suffered a negative impact on mental health and have been unjustly discriminated for spreading the disease in Europe (data collection from April to November 2020). Participants in the ApartTogether Survey (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 8297, after listwise deletion of missing items final NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 3940) provided data regarding to their difficulties to adhere to preventive recommendations against COVID-19 infection (CARE), self-perceived stigmatization (SS), and psychological distress (PD). Structural Equation Modeling was used to investigate PD as a mediator in the pathway linking CARE to SS, while adjusting for the housing and residence status. To improve confidence in the findings, single hold-out sample cross-validation was performed using a train/test split ratio of 0.8/0.2. In the exploratory set (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 3159) SS was associated with both CARE (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.200, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã‚Â 0.001) and PD (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.455, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Moreover, PD was also associated with CARE (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.094, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and mediated the effect of CARE on SS (proportion mediatedÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.7%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The results were successfully replicated in the confirmation set (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 781; total effectÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.417, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã‚Â 0.001; proportion mediatedÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29.7%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã‚Â 0.001). Follow-up analyses also found evidence for an opposite effect (i.e., from SS to CARE, BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.132; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), suggesting that there might be a vicious circle between the self-perceived stigmatization and the access to health care and the use of preventive measures against COVID-19 infection. Refugees and other migrants who had more difficulties in accessing health care and preventive measures against COVID-19 infection experienced worse mental health and increased discrimination. These negative effects appeared to be stronger for those with more insecure housing and residence status, highlighting from one side the specific risk of insecure housing in the impact of COVID-19 upon mental health and infection protection, and for another side the need to proper housing as a strategy to prevent both COVID-19 and mental distress.","Marchi, Magarini, Chiarenza, Galeazzi, Paloma, Garrido, Ioannidi, Vassilikou, de Matos, Gaspar, Guedes, Primdahl, Skovdal, Murphy, Durbeej, Osman, Watters, van den Muijsenbergh, Sturm, Oulahal, Padilla, Willems, Spiritus-Beerden, Verelst, Derluyn","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-13370-y","20220510","COVID-19; Mental health; Migrants; Public health; Social stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31264,""
"A longitudinal study on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease","The COVID-19 pandemic led to psychological consequences on people's mental health, representing a condition of increased vulnerability for the weakest sections of population, including elderly patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This longitudinal study aimed at exploring the impact of the most frequent non-motor symptoms and their contribute on health-related quality of life of PD patients after the COVID-19 outbreak, in comparison with the pre-pandemic status. Forty-two non-demented PD patients underwent a first assessment between December 2018 and January 2020 (T0). Then, between March and May 2021 (T1), they were contacted again and asked to complete the second assessment. Levels of global functioning, several non-motor symptoms (i.e. depression, apathy, anxiety, anhedonia) and health-related quality of life were investigated. Results of the the paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test showed that at T1, PD patients scored lower on the emotional subscale of the DAS, ZÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.49; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.013; Cohen d<sub>z</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.691.

The present study suggested that self-isolation at home might lead to a reduction of apathy and anhedonia in PD patients due to the increase in social support provided by families during COVID-19 restrictions. This evidence brings out the need of a consistent and persistent social support which might be represented by caregivers or/and social assistive robotics.","D'Iorio, Baiano, Maraucci, Vitale, Amboni, Santangelo","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10072-022-06112-w","20220510","COVID-19; Non-motor symptoms; ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; Social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31265,""
"Transitioning to Telehealth for COVID-19 and Beyond: Perspectives of Community Mental Health Clinicians","In response to COVID-19, mental health clinics transitioned to telehealth to maintain psychotherapy delivery. Community mental health (CMH) settings, which are often under-resourced, likely experienced many barriers. This study examined CMH clinicians' experiences transitioning to telehealth. Data came from a state-funded initiative training CMH clinicians in cognitive behavioral therapy. Participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°197) completed pre-training and post-consultation surveys which included questions about their experiences with telehealth. Most clinicians found telehealth beneficial and effective. Clinicians strongly endorsed wanting telehealth as an option even after in-person services resume. CMH clinicians rated ""engaging younger children"" as the most significant barrier to telehealth. Despite some telehealth barriers, clinicians generally viewed telehealth favorably and prefer having it as a long-term option. Future work should continue to understand when telehealth may be advantageous and for whom in order to improve the accessibility and quality of behavioral health services.","AlRasheed, Woodard, Nguyen, Daniels, Park, Berliner, Dorsey","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11414-022-09799-z","20220510","Children/adolescents; Community mental health; Evidence-based treatments; Transition to telehealth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31266,""
"Reply to correspondence ""Contributing factors towards progression of migraines during the Covid-19 pandemic""","We read Shafeeq Ahmed's letter about our recent article with interest. Stress is one of the most well-known migraine triggers. Early studies have already revealed that stress significantly affects migraine clinical course during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we also took into account the stress factor in our study. We tried to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological state of our patients using the Beck Depression Inventory and the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, personal protective equipment and disinfectants have been used so widely and intensively for the first time. Thus, we thought that evaluating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on migraine only through stress would be an inadequate approach. Our study demonstrated that in addition to stress, mask types, number of masks, duration of mask use, and disinfectant exposure might affect migraine attacks. Taking these factors into account, treatment and preventative methods may improve migraine sufferers' quality of life.","Yuksel, Kenar, Gursoy, Bektas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocn.2022.04.044","20220510","COVID-19; Disinfectants; Masks; Migraine; Personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31267,""
"COVID-19 Experiences and Health-Related Implications: Results From a Mixed-Method Longitudinal Study of Urban Poor Adolescents in Shanghai","This analysis aimed to investigate gender differences in adolescents' concerns and the health implications of COVID-19. We used two rounds of the Global Early Adolescent Study (GEAS) collected in Shanghai in 2018 and 2020. We analyzed data from 621 adolescents, comparing boys' and girls' concerns about COVID-19 and examining trends in general health and mental health by sex between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods. Changes in health indicators over time were assessed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models. Adolescent girls reported more health concerns (52.0% vs. 42.7%) and educational concerns (61.0% vs. 46.3%) than boys, whereas boys expressed more worries about the economic consequences of COVID-19 (32.9% vs. 25.4%). Changes in health-related outcomes during the pandemic compared to the prepandemic era differed by sex and varied by COVID-related experiences. Boys reported improved overall health (OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.00, 2.35) in the COVID-19 period relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. Such improvements were only observed among boys who reported no family economic hardships (OR: 2.10, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.58). We found no significant change for girls (OR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.83, 1.55), regardless of COVID-19 economic impacts. In contrast, girls reported increased anxiety (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.45), especially among those who were concerned about their academic performance (OR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.16, 2.97). Boys experienced no such increase (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.54), regardless of their education concerns.

"Emotional Support Among Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Couples During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Emotional support, particularly support from family and close friends, is essential to mental health outcomes especially for members of the LGBTQ+ community. The COVID-19 pandemic has drawn attention to the important role of emotional support especially for marginalized communities. Although emotional support is recognized as a critical resource, to date no research has examined access to support during the pandemic for gender and sexual diverse populations. I draw on a new population-based data source of 3,642 respondents, the National Couplesâ€™ Health and Time Use Study (NCHAT), which oversampled sexual and gender diverse populations during the pandemic (September 2020-April 2021). I focus on two sources of emotional support: family members and friends. Respondents who identified as exclusively heterosexual relied more on emotional support from family than respondents who identified as exclusively gay/lesbian, bisexual including pan, omni, and queer, and those reporting another sexual identity or multiple sexual identities. However, respondents who did not identify as heterosexual relied more on emotional support from friends compared to exclusively heterosexual respondents. There were no significant differences among respondents who identity as sexual minorities in regard to family or friend support. This work contributes to understanding of the social climate and resources available to sexual and diverse populations during a major public health crisis.","Kristen Gustafson et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E023B-0A0-B64","20220512","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology; emotional support; friend support; covid-19; family support; lgbt; social support; sexual minority","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-12","",31274,""
