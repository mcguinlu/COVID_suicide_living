"COVID-19 Vaccine hesitancy in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: A mixed-methods study","Background: COVID-19 infection is a global pandemic threatening the public health. Due to the development and initiation of vaccination, currently significant difference upon vaccine acceptance is seen between developed and developing countries. However, there are no data on the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Methods: An embedded mixed method study [QUAN(quali)] was conducted among residents of Akaki Kality sub-city in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. For the quantitative part, a multi-stage sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants (n = 422). Twenty four adults were included purposively for the qualitative in-depth interview. Data was collected by face-to-face interview by using a semi-structured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model. Result: The mean age of the participants was 34.1 years (SD 12.9). Nearly half (46.7%) of the participants exhibited poor level of knowledge and 51.8% had negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures. One out five (19.1%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated when it becomes available. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI: 1.10 - 3.89, p=0.03), negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI: 1.08 - 3.02, p=0.04), and information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI: 1.75 - 7.37, P <0.0001). Conclusion: A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccine and unwilling to accept once it is available. Several conspiracy theories were put forth to justify their stance and this was mainly due to the misconceptions distributed from the use of social media as source of information. Overall, providing the community with health education and consistent government efforts in uphold the prevention measures are of paramount importance to tackle this pandemic.","Nebiyu Dereje; Abigel Tesfaye; Beamlak Tamene; Dina Alemshet; Haymanot Abe; Nathnael Tesfa; Saron Gedion; Tigist Biruk; Yabets Lakew","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.25.21252443","20210301","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-01","",11316,""
"Mental Health of International Migrant Workers Amidst Large-Scale Dormitory Outbreaks of COVID-19: A Population Survey","Background: In the COVID-19 pandemic, international migrant workers have faced increased vulnerability on account of their status. This study examined the mental health burden of COVID-19 amongst low-waged migrant workers involved in large-scale dormitory outbreaks within Singapore. Methods: Between 22 June to 11 October 2020, questionnaires were distributed in-person and online to 1011 migrant workers subjected to movement restrictions. Mental health symptoms were assessed using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). As covariates, we also assessed participants' socio-demographics, quarantine status, COVID-19 health concerns, financial stability, and exposure to news and misinformation. Linear regression models were fitted to identify factors associated with each of the three DASS-21 subscales. Findings: Complete movement restrictions (e.g., prolonged in-dormitory quarantine) were associated with increased depression and stress symptoms, while being diagnosed with COVID-19 was associated with increased anxiety. Participants who harboured fears about their health or job, perceived their health to be poorer, or had higher exposure to COVID-19 rumours reported higher scores on all three subscales. At a group level, documented rates of severe or extremely severe depression (3.1%, 95% CI: 2.1-4.3%), anxiety (4.1%, 95% CI: 2.9-5.5%), and stress (1.3%, 95% CI: 0.7-2.2%) were similar to those observed in the general population for the host country. Interpretation: The risk factors identified underscore how the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact on the mental health of migrant workers. At the same time, we observed resilience amongst migrant workers, with no evidence of increased symptomology relative to the general population.","Young Ern Saw; Edina YQ Tan; P Buvanaswari; Kinjal Doshi; Jean CJ Liu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.24.21252414","20210301","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-01","",11317,""
"Time-dependent association between the discussions of mass protests and mental health on social media during the 2019 anti-government social unrest in Hong Kong: A text mining study","Purpose Social media are increasingly pivotal as the platform where activists and observers plan, promote, and respond to collective actions. To examine how mental health discourse might be impacted by mass protests, this study analyzed their time-dependent association during the 2019 anti-government social unrest in Hong Kong. Methods Consecutive day-by-day user-generated content on online forums and social network sites (SNS) from June to November 2019 was obtained. A Cantonese term-list was created to identify terms related to mass protests and mental health discourse. The frequency of comments containing such terms was analyzed using time series models. Results There were 3,572,665 social media comments in the investigation period. As hypothesized, the frequency of comments with mass protest terms was higher on days with mass protests than on days without. Frequency of comments with both mass protest- and mental health-terms was also higher on days with protests than days without. A time-lagged effect of protest-terms was found on online forums but not on SNS. Our results suggest a positive association between offline protest activities and online psychological reactions. Conclusions Social media content reveals discussion of mental health concerns stemming from, or exacerbated by, social unrest. The potential mutual influences between mass protests and online reactions, as well as the functional differences between online forums and SNS in this regard, are discussed. Street protests and their associated mental health discourse can be readily detected on popular online forums. Mental health services should consider such dynamic relationships between on- and offline activities.","Christian Shaunlyn Chan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46181-B25-526","20210301","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; mental health discourse; time series; social media; protest; social unrest","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-01","",11318,""
"Trajectories of change in internalizing symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal population-based study","Background: Longitudinal data indicates that the mental health of the general population may not have been as badly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic as some had feared. Most studies examining change in mental health during the pandemic have assumed population homogeneity which may conceal evidence of worsening mental health for some. In this study, we applied a heterogeneous perspective to determine if there were distinct groups in the population characterised by different patterns of change in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic. Methods: Self-report data were collected from a nationally representative sample of Irish adults (N = 1,041) at four time-points between April and December 2020. Results: In the entire sample, mean levels of internalizing symptoms significantly declined from March to December 2020. However, we identified four distinct groups with different patterns of change. The most common response was â€˜Resilienceâ€™ (66.7%), followed by â€˜Improvingâ€™ (17.9%), â€˜Worseningâ€™ (11.3%), and â€˜Sustainedâ€™ (4.1%). Belonging to the â€˜Worseningâ€™ class was associated with younger age, city dwelling, current and past treatment for a mental health problem, higher levels of empathy, and higher levels of loneliness. Limitations: Sample attrition was relatively high and although this was managed using robust statistical methods, bias associated with non-responses cannot be entirely ruled out. Conclusion: The majority of adults experienced no change, or an improvement in internalizing symptoms during the pandemic, and a relatively small proportion of adults experienced a worsening of internalizing symptoms. Limited public mental health resources should be targeted toward helping these at-risk individuals.","Philip Hyland et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46191-A0B-104","20210301","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Quantitative Methods; stress; depression; resilience; anxiety; covid-19; internalizing symptoms; population study; mental health; longitudinal","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-01","",11319,""
