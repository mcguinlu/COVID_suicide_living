"Clinical characteristics and factors affecting the duration of positive nucleic acid test for patients of COVID-19 in XinYu, China","The outbreak of a new coronavirus, COVID-19, which was earliest reported in Wuhan, China, is now transmitting throughout the world. The aim of this study was to articulate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 and to reveal possible factors that may affect the persistent time of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, so as to identify which patients may deteriorate or have poor prognoses as early as possible. Retrospective cohort study was carried out on 47 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to XinYu People's Hospital of JiangXi Province. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratorial, management, treatment, and outcome data were also collected and analyzed. In this study, patients were divided into two groups based on whether their SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests in respiratory specimens turn negative within (Group Rapid or Group R) or over (Group Slow or Group S) a week. There was no significant difference in age, sex, travel or exposure history, and smoking history between the two groups. Forty-two patients had been observed with comorbidities. Similar clinical manifestations, for instance fever, cough, sputum, and fatigue, have been observed among patients in both groups, except that patients in Group S were obviously more likely to get fatigue than patients in Group R. Both groups had shown decrease in white blood cell or lymphocyte counts. Chest X-ray or computed tomography scan showed unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. High proportion in both groups has used nasal cannula (89.47% vs. 85.71%) to inhale oxygen. 10.53% of Group S have applied high-flow nasal cannula, while Group R used none. The current treatment is mainly antibiotics, antiviral, and traditional Chinese medicine, while a couple of patients has used methylprednisolone. Only 1 patient out of both groups got even worse despite this active treatment. Clinical characteristics of COVID-19 include the exposure history and typical systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, decreased WBC and lymphocyte counts, and infiltration in both lower lobes on CT imaging. Among them, fatigue appears to be an important factor that affects the duration of positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test in respiratory specimens.","Lu, Yin, Li, Fu, Hu, Huang, Chen, Li, Guo","https://doi.org/10.1002/jcla.23534","20200829","COVID-19; Coronavirus disease; SARS-CoV-2; clinical characteristics; fatigue","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-30","",4215,""
"A rapid review of pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes","COVID-19 spread rapidly causing widescale loss of life and economic devastation. Efforts to contain it have resulted in measures such as closing of borders and restrictions around travel, social activities and attending places of worship. We conducted this rapid review to systematically examine, synthesise and critically appraise the available evidence on the relationship between pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes. The methods were compliant with the PRISMA guidelines. The review was preregistered with PROSPERO (Registration #: CRD42020181576). A literature search was conducted from January 2010-April 2020 using ProQuest, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, SAGE Journals and CINAHL. Of 3844 articles identified, we included 11 quantitative articles in the final synthesis, representing data from 32,049 individual respondents from eight countries. We identified three pandemics (COVID-19, MERS-CoV, Influenza A(H1N1) pdm09) as well as several psychological outcomes including anxiety, mental distress, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anger. We also identified several behaviours during pandemics and categorised them into protective, preparedness, and perverse behaviours. The review showed that even though there is limited evidence regarding pandemic-related behaviours and psychological outcomes, the current findings showed that the psychological outcomes significantly impacted on the adoption of the pandemic-related behaviours. Given the negative effects of psychological outcomes on behaviours, we recommend that mental health professionals should promote mental health support to people exhibiting psychological distress resulting from similar events in the future. Also, we recommend that future research should test the hypothesised effects of pandemics and psychological outcomes on behaviour change.","Usher, Jackson, Durkin, Gyamfi, Bhullar","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12790","20200829","behaviour change; pandemic; psychological outcomes; rapid review; systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-30","",4216,""

"Compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain","To evaluate compassion fatigue, burnout, compassion satisfaction, and perceived stress in healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain. Spain has been one of the countries hardest hit by the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Healthcare professionals have had to deal with traumatic and complex situations in the work context. In these particularly stressful situations, many professionals may develop compassion fatigue or burnout, which puts them at risk for mental health problems. Cross-sectional online survey. A total of 506 healthcare professionals (physicians and nurses) who were working in healthcare centres during the COVID-19 pandemic participated. Compassion fatigue, compassion satisfaction, and burnout were assessed with the Professional Quality of Life Questionnaire (ProQoL), and perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14). Socio-demographic and occupational variables were also analysed. Data were collected during the period of the highest incidence of cases and highest mortality rates due to COVID-19 in Spain. This article adheres to the STROBE guidelines for the reporting of observational studies. Physicians had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while nurses had higher compassion satisfaction scores. Perceived stress scores were similar in both occupations. Professionals working in specific COVID-19 units and in emergency departments had higher compassion fatigue and burnout scores, while levels of compassion satisfaction and perceived stress were similar regardless of the workplace. Despite the health crisis situation and its implications for healthcare professionals, the levels of compassion fatigue and burnout have remained moderate/high. However, compassion satisfaction seems to be increasing, especially among nurses, possibly due to their motivation to relieve suffering and due to their perceived social recognition. It is necessary to implement interventions that help improve compassion satisfaction and prevent burnout and compassion fatigue among professionals in the long term.","Ruiz-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Ramos-Pichardo, IbÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez-Masero, Cabrera-Troya, Carmona-Rega, Ortega-GalÃƒÂ¡n","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.15469","20200829","Burnout; COVID-19; Compassion Fatigue; Compassion Satisfaction; Healthcare Professionals","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-30","",4218,""
