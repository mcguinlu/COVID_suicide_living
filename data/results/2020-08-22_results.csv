"The impacts of a COVID-19 epidemic focus and general belief in a just world on individual emotions","Whether the general belief in a just world (GBJW) can protect individual emotions during a major disaster is a matter of debate  This study conducted two experiments to explore this question during the COVID-19 epidemic  Experiment 1 (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>92, Mage<U+202F>=<U+202F>22 52, 48 91% was male) manipulated the focus regarding the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate the impact of this focus on participants' emotions  The results showed that compared with the nonepidemic focus group, the epidemic focus group had higher negative emotions and lower positive emotions  Experiment 2 (N<U+202F>=<U+202F>200, Mage<U+202F>=<U+202F>23 91, 49% was male) manipulated the epidemic focus and GBJW to investigate their effects on the participants' emotions  The results showed that high levels of GBJW reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions regardless of whether the participants were focused on the epidemic  This study expands the influence of the GBJW on individual emotions and finds that the GBJW can protect individuals' emotions when they face a major social disaster  These findings imply that controlling people's intake of information on the epidemic can avoid their suffering from the vicarious traumatization caused by epidemic-related information overload and that improving the public's GBJW protects their mental health during an epidemic","Wang, Jin; Wang, Zhuo; Liu, Xiaojin; Yang, Xiaofan; Zheng, Meilin; Bai, Xuejun","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2020.110349","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;2020.; Publication details: Personality and Individual Differences;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4008,""
"Anxiety and depression symptoms, and lack of emotional support among the general population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic A prospective national study on prevalence and risk factors","Background The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health and emotional support among the general population are unclear  We therefore assessed if the prevalence of high Anxiety and Depression Symptoms (ADS) levels and lack of Emotional Support (ES) increased, and if risk factors of ADS and ES changed  Methods Data was extracted from surveys conducted with the Dutch longitudinal population-based LISS panel (N=3,983)  ADS and ES were assessed in March 2019 and 2020  Risk factors for ADS and ES were extracted from surveys in November 2018 and 2019  These were: ADS, gender, education, domestic situation, employment, age, ethnicity, lung and heart problems, and diabetes  Results The prevalence of high ADS levels and lack of ES did not increase compared to the pre-outbreak prevalence  ADS, non-native ethnic background, (partial) work disabilities and lung problems were predictive of both ADS and lack of ES in March 2019 and 2020  Job seekers, students and those who take care of housekeeping were more at risk for ADS in March 2020, but not in 2019  While 35-49 years old respondents were less at risk for ADS in March 2019, they were more at risk in 2020  Parents with child(ren) at home and those who take care of housekeeping more often lacked ES in March 2020, but not in 2019  Limitations No other mental health problems were assessed  Conclusions No increase in the prevalence of ADS and lack of ES was found  Some risk factors remained significant after the outbreak, while others changed notably","van der Velden, Peter G.; Fonds Slachtofferhulp, Carlo Contino; Das, Marcel; van Loon, Peter; Trauma, van Loon Crisis Stress; Bosmans, Mark","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.08.026","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Affective Disorders;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4009,""

"Cellular and Molecular Pathways of COVID-19 and Potential Points of Therapeutic Intervention","With the objective of linking early findings relating to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with potentially informative findings from prior research literature and to promote investigation toward therapeutic response, a coherent cellular and molecular pathway is proposed for COVID-19  The pathway is consistent with a broad range of observed clinical features and biological markers and captures key mediators of pathophysiology  In this proposed pathway, membrane fusion and cytoplasmic entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus via ACE2 and TMPRSS2-expressing respiratory epithelial cells, including pulmonary type-II pneumocytes, provoke an initial immune response featuring inflammatory cytokine production coupled with a weak interferon response, particularly in IFN-<U+03BB>â€“dependent epithelial defense  Differentiation of non-classic pathogenic T-cells and pro-inflammatory intermediate monocytes contributes to a skewed inflammatory profile, mediated by membrane-bound immune receptor subtypes (e g , Fc<U+03B3>RIIA) and downstream signaling pathways (e g , NF-<U+03BA>B p65 and p38 MAPK), followed by chemotactic infiltration of monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils into lung tissue  Endothelial barrier degradation and capillary leakage contribute to alveolar cell damage  Inflammatory cytokine release, delayed neutrophil apoptosis, and NETosis contribute to pulmonary thrombosis and cytokine storm  These mechanisms are concordant with observed clinical markers in COVID-19, including high expression of inflammatory cytokines on the TNF-a/IL-6 axis, elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), diffuse alveolar damage via cell apoptosis in respiratory epithelia and vascular endothelia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and CRP, high production of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), depressed platelet count, and thrombosis  Although certain elements are likely to be revised as new findings emerge, the proposed pathway suggests multiple points of investigation for potential therapeutic interventions  Initial candidate interventions include prophylaxis to augment epithelial defense (e g , AT1 receptor blockade, type III and type I interferons, melatonin, calcitriol, camostat, and lopinavir) and to reduce viral load (e g , remdesivir, ivermectin, emetine, Abelson kinase inhibitors, dopamine D2 antagonists, and selective estrogen receptor modulators)  Additional interventions focus on tempering inflammatory signaling and injury (e g , dexamethasone, doxycycline, Ang1-7, estradiol, alpha blockers, and DHA/EPA, pasireotide), as well as inhibitors targeted toward molecular mediators of the maladaptive COVID-19 immune response (e g , IL-6, TNF-a, IL-17, JAK, and CDK9)","Hussman, J.

"From containment to harm reduction from SARS-CoV-2: a fabric mask for enhanced effectiveness, comfort, and compliance","Although the COVID-19 pandemic shows no signs of abating, public health strategies have transitioned from containment to harm reduction. In light of this paradigm shift, it is critical that individuals take steps to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. In the United States, the CDC recommends that individuals wear face coverings in public places, such as grocery stores. As lockdowns are being phased out around the world, authorities are requiring the use of such masks in public places while maintaining social distance. Individuals (including healthcare professionals outside of their clinical settings) and manufacturers are following the CDCâ€™s recommendation. But, many currently available masks are not form-fitting, are not customizable, and are uncomfortable with even short-term use, thereby undercutting their effectiveness. Moreover, because cotton absorbs and retains the moisture found in an exhaled breath masks made of cotton have the potential to increase the wearerâ€™s risk of infection. Thus, as we shift to harm reduction and social distancing measures relax, it is imperative that these shortcomings in fabric masks are addressed and that is the motivation for this research. The overall objective of the research is to design, develop, and test a fabric mask that is effective while being comfortable during continuous use over long periods of time. As the first step in the design process, we reviewed the modes of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus. We analyzed a medical mask and a fabric mask in the market and identified their shortcomings. We carried out an in-depth analysis of user needs and developed the performance requirements of the proposed mask. We defined the architecture of the mask comprising the following principal components: Barrier, Form-Fitting, Positioning, and Fastening. We tested and evaluated candidate materials for the components and developed the design specifications and construction details for the mask. We produced the mask and carried out subjective testing on a user in a typical workplace setting; we demonstrated that the mask was form-fitting, customizable, washable, and could be worn continuously and routinely over extended periods of time by individuals and therefore could serve as an effective means to reduce the harm from SARS-CoV-2.","Park, Sungmee; Jayaraman, Sundaresan","https://doi.org/10.1080/00405000.2020.1805971","","Database: ELSEVIER; Publication details: J.

"Influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on public attitudes toward bats in Arkansas and implications for bat management","Through a public input collection tool, we opportunistically discovered a relationship between COVID-19, attitudes toward bats, and support for bat management in Arkansas. The Arkansas Game and Fish Commission requested public input on a proposed regulation to prohibit the killing of bats except when necessary for rabies testing. When all reasons for support or opposition are combined, 59 (11%) mentioned diseases, of which 22 (37%) specifically mentioned COVID-19. Almost all (nÂ =Â 21, 96%) statements that mentioned COVID-19 also included language that indicated a negative attitude toward bats. This suggests that the connection between resident bat species and COVID-19 may be a salient belief among Arkansans.

"Unlocking challenges and opportunities presented by COVID-19 pandemic for cross-cutting disruption in agri-food and green deal innovations: Quo Vadis?","COVID-19 pandemic is on a trajectory to cause catastrophic global upheaval with the potential to alter geopolitical and socio-economic norms. Many countries are frantically responding with staggering financial stimulus recovery initiatives. This opinion-paper reviews challenges, opportunities, and potential solutions for the post-COVID-19 era that focuses on intensive sustaining of agri-food supply chain in tandem with meeting the high demand for new green deal innovation. For example, the development of wet peatland innovation, known as Paludiculture, can intensively sustain and blend agri-food and green innovations that will help support COVID-19 pandemic transitioning. The future looks bright for the creation of new sustainability multi-actor innovation hubs that will support, connect, and enable businesses to recover and pivot beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. The nexus between first 'Green Deal' initiative supporting 64 selected European Startups and SMEs (European Innovation Council) and 43 Irish Disruptive Technology projects are addressed in the context of cross-cutting developments and relevance to COVID-19.

"Prognostic factors in Spanish COVID-19 patients: A case series from Barcelona","In addition to the lack of COVID-19 diagnostic tests for the whole Spanish population, the current strategy is to identify the disease early to limit contagion in the community. To determine clinical factors of a poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19 infection. Descriptive, observational, retrospective study in three primary healthcare centres with an assigned population of 100,000. Examination of the medical records of patients with COVID-19 infections confirmed by polymerase chain reaction. Logistic multivariate regression models adjusted for age and sex were constructed to analyse independent predictive factors associated with death, ICU admission and hospitalization. We included 322 patients (mean age 56.7 years, 50% female, 115 (35.7%) aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 65 years): 123 (38.2) were health workers (doctors, nurses, auxiliaries). Predictors of ICU admission or death were greater age (OR = 1.05; 95%CI = 1.03 to 1.07), male sex (OR = 2.94; 95%CI = 1.55 to 5.82), autoimmune disease (OR = 2.82; 95%CI = 1.00 to 7.84), bilateral pulmonary infiltrates (OR = 2.86; 95%CI = 1.41 to 6.13), elevated lactate-dehydrogenase (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.28 to 6.90), elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.85; 95%CI = 1.22 to 6.98) and elevated C-reactive protein (OR = 2.38; 95%CI = 1.22 to 4.68).

"Addressing Postpandemic Clinician Mental Health : A Narrative Review and Conceptual Framework","Previous pandemics have seen high psychiatric morbidity among health care workers. Protecting clinician mental health in the aftermath of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) requires an evidence-based approach to developing and deploying comprehensive clinician mental health support. In a narrative review of 96 articles addressing clinician mental health in COVID-19 and prior pandemics, 7 themes emerged: 1) the need for resilience and stress reduction training; 2) providing for clinicians' basic needs (food, drink, adequate rest, quarantine-appropriate housing, transportation, child care, personal protective equipment); 3) the importance of specialized training for pandemic-induced changes in job roles; 4) recognition and clear communication from leadership; 5) acknowledgment of and strategies for addressing moral injury; 6) the need for peer and social support interventions; and 7) normalization and provision of mental health support programs. In addition to the literature review, in collaboration with the Collaborative for Healing and Renewal in Medicine (CHARM) network, the authors gathered practice guidelines and resources from health care organizations and professional societies worldwide to synthesize a list of resources deemed high-yield by well-being leaders. Studies of previous pandemics demonstrate heightened distress in health care workers years after the event. The COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges that surpass those of previous pandemics, suggesting a significant mental health toll on clinicians. Long-term, proactive individual, organizational, and societal infrastructures for clinician mental health support are needed to mitigate the psychological costs of providing care during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Schwartz, Sinskey, Anand, Margolis","https://doi.org/10.7326/M20-4199","20200821","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4028,""

"Resilience, COVID-19-related stress, anxiety and depression during the pandemic in a large population enriched for healthcare providers","COVID-19 pandemic is a global calamity posing an unprecedented opportunity to study resilience. We developed a brief resilience survey probing self-reliance, emotion-regulation, interpersonal-relationship patterns and neighborhood-environment, and applied it online during the acute COVID-19 outbreak (April 6-15, 2020), on a crowdsourcing research website ( www.covid19resilience.org ) advertised through social media. We evaluated level of stress (worries) regarding COVID-19: (1) contracting, (2) dying from, (3) currently having, (4) family member contracting, (5) unknowingly infecting others with (6) experiencing significant financial burden following. Anxiety (GAD7) and depression (PHQ2) were measured. Totally, 3042 participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1964 females, age range 18-79, mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39) completed the resilience and COVID-19-related stress survey and 1350 of them (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°41, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°997 females) completed GAD7 and PHQ2.

Avoiding 1.75 million deaths or 20.5 trillion person years of life lost would be valued at $10.2 to $17.5 trillion. The age patterns of COVID-19 mortality in other countries are quite similar and increase at rates close to each country's rate for all-cause mortality. The scenario of 1 million COVID-19 deaths is similar in scale to that of the decades-long HIV/AIDS and opioid-overdose epidemics but considerably smaller than that of the Spanish flu of 1918. Unlike HIV/AIDS and opioid epidemics, the COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in a period of months rather than spread out over decades.","Goldstein, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2006392117","20200821","COVID-19; demography; epidemic; life expectancy; mortality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4031,""

"Impact of the societal response to COVID-19 on access to healthcare for non-COVID-19 health issues in slum communities of Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan: results of pre-COVID and COVID-19 lockdown stakeholder engagements","With COVID-19, there is urgency for policymakers to understand and respond to the health needs of slum communities. Lockdowns for pandemic control have health, social and economic consequences. We consider access to healthcare before and during COVID-19 with those working and living in slum communities. In seven slums in Bangladesh, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan, we explored stakeholder perspectives and experiences of healthcare access for non-COVID-19 conditions in two periods: pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 lockdowns. Between March 2018 and May 2020, we engaged with 860 community leaders, residents, health workers and local authority representatives. Perceived common illnesses in all sites included respiratory, gastric, waterborne and mosquitoborne illnesses and hypertension. Pre-COVID, stakeholders described various preventive, diagnostic and treatment services, including well-used antenatal and immunisation programmes and some screening for hypertension, tuberculosis, HIV and vectorborne disease. In all sites, pharmacists and patent medicine vendors were key providers of treatment and advice for minor illnesses. Mental health services and those addressing gender-based violence were perceived to be limited or unavailable. With COVID-19, a reduction in access to healthcare services was reported in all sites, including preventive services. Cost of healthcare increased while household income reduced. Residents had difficulty reaching healthcare facilities. Fear of being diagnosed with COVID-19 discouraged healthcare seeking. Alleviators included provision of healthcare by phone, pharmacists/drug vendors extending credit and residents receiving philanthropic or government support; these were inconsistent and inadequate. Slum residents' ability to seek healthcare for non-COVID-19 conditions has been reduced during lockdowns. To encourage healthcare seeking, clear communication is needed about what is available and whether infection control is in place. Policymakers need to ensure that costs do not escalate and unfairly disadvantage slum communities. Remote consulting to reduce face-to-face contact and provision of mental health and gender-based violence services should be considered.","Ahmed, Ajisola, Azeem, Bakibinga, Chen, Choudhury, Fayehun, Griffiths, Harris, Kibe, Lilford, Omigbodun, Rizvi, Sartori, Smith, Watson, Wilson, Yeboah, Aujla, Azam, Diggle, Gill, Iqbal, Kabaria, Kisia, Kyobutungi, Madan, Mberu, Mohamed, Nazish, Odubanjo, Osuh, Owoaje, Oyebode, Porto de Albuquerque, Rahman, Tabani, Taiwo, Tregonning, Uthman, Yusuf","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2020-003042","20200821","disease; disorder; health policy; health systems; or injury; other infection; public health; qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4033,""

Structural and practical xenophobia has driven asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in SA to abject poverty and misery. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) containment measures adopted by the SA government through the lockdown of the nation have tremendously deepened the unequal treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees in SA. This can be seen through the South African government's lack of consideration of this marginalized population in economic, poverty, and hunger alleviation schemes. Leaving this category of our society out of the national response safety nets may lead to negative coping strategies causing mental health issues and secondary health concerns.

"Health Inequalities in the Use of Telehealth in the United States in the Lens of COVID-19","The use of remote health care services, or telehealth, is a promising solution for providing health care to those unable to access care in person easily and thus helping to reduce health inequalities. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders in the United States have created an optimal situation for the use of telehealth services for non-life-threatening health care use. A retrospective cohort study was performed using Kantar's ClaritisÃ¢â€žÂ¢ database, which links insurance claims encounters (Komodo Health) with patient-reported data (Kantar Health, National Health &amp; Wellness Survey). Logistic regression models (odds ratios [OR], 95% confidence intervals [CI]) examined predictors of telehealth versus in-person encounters. Adults ages Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years eligible for payer-complete health care encounters in both March 2019 and March 2020 were identified (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35,376). Telehealth use increased from 0.2% in 2019 to 1.9% in 2020. In adjusted models of respondents with Ã¢â€°Â¥1 health care encounter (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11,614), age, marital status, geographic residence (region; urban/rural), and presence of anxiety or depression were significant predictors of telehealth compared with in-person use in March 2020. For example, adults 45-46 years versus 18-44 years were less likely to use telehealth (OR 0.684, 95% CI: 0.561-0.834), and respondents living in urban versus rural areas were more likely to use telehealth (OR 1.543, 95% CI: 1.153-2.067). Substantial increases in telehealth use were observed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States; however, disparities existed.

"What the world could learn from the Haitian resilience while managing COVID-19","In the 1st trimester of 2020, there were mixed feelings among Haitians about the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. In effect, many of the concerns emanating from the relatively weak health infrastructure in Haiti were analyzed from a resilience perspective. Many professionals living in Haiti with whom we have conversed believe that Haitians were better prepared to cope with the social distancing and mental health outcomes associated with the pandemic because of their 3-month exposure to the effects of Peyi LÃƒÂ²k (&quot;country in lockdown&quot;) as well as previous major natural disasters. In that regard, previous traumatic exposures may serve as a buffer against the debilitating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic among Haitians. For the past 3 months, Haitians have naturally adopted a practical posture to cope with the pandemic where only school buildings are closed. Consequently, we remain convinced that from a psychological perspective, individuals from high-income countries that are severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic could learn from the Haitian way of coping with large-scale disasters.

"The COVID-19 telepsychology revolution: A national study of pandemic-based changes in US mental health care delivery","The COVID-19 pandemic has altered mental health care delivery like no other event in modern history. The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.

"The mental health of immigrants and refugees: Canadian evidence from a nationally linked database","Few studies of the healthy immigrant effect (HIE) have examined the mental health outcomes of Canadian-born individuals on a national scale compared with immigrants by admission category. This study fills this gap by examining the self-reported mental health (SRMH) of immigrants by admission category and other immigration dimensions (e.g., source world region and duration since landing) and making comparisons with Canadian-born respondents to a population-based survey. Based on four cycles (2011 to 2014) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) linked to the Longitudinal Immigration Database (IMDB), odds ratios of high (i.e., excellent or very good) SRMH among Canadian-born respondents and IMDB-linked immigrants are compared using logistic regression. Among the IMDB immigrant population, high SRMH was also examined according to the above-mentioned immigration dimensions. Adjusted results were hierarchically controlled for age, sex, social and economic factors, and sense of belonging. Age-sex adjusted results show that immigrants, especially refugees, are less likely than the Canadian-born population to report high mental health levels, but these differences disappeared after full adjustment. The odds of immigrants having high SRMH differed more by source world region and duration since landing. For example, fully adjusted results show support for the HIE, with recent immigrants (interviewed within 10 years of landing) more likely to report high SRMH than either the Canadian-born population or established immigrants. Greater odds of high SRMH among recent immigrants also holds across admission classes and for selected world regions. This study provides new evidence on differences in mental health between Canadian-born individuals and immigrants by various characteristics. Results support a deterioration of the HIE in SRMH and identify factors significantly associated with SRMH.

We adapted our protocol to administer telephone rather than in-person follow-up surveys and included questions about COVID-19. The majority of participants (99%) reported having heard of COVID-19; 23% reported no longer being able to go outside, 17% reported that they could no longer go to their regular clinic for medical care, and 3% reported that they could no longer get medication refills. PHQ-9 screening identified 9% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45) with mild depression symptoms, and 1% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3) with moderate-to-severe depression symptoms. Young adults 20-24 years old had more mild to severe depressive symptoms than the younger age groups (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Offering remote peer-support or mental health care, continuing to offer differentiated care services, and considering financial support will support the health and well-being of ALHIV.","Dyer, Wilson, Badia, Agot, Neary, Njuguna, Kibugi, Healy, Beima-Sofie, John-Stewart, Kohler","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-020-03005-x","20200820","Adolescent; Depression; Differentiated care; HIV; Kenya","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4041,""
"Including Children with Developmental Disabilities in the Equation During this COVID-19 Pandemic","Amidst the ongoing novel Coronavirus disease pandemic, children with developmental disabilities warrant specific attention to minimise having disproportionate consequences. These children are especially vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic due to (1) Greater healthcare needs, (2) Dependency on community-based services and (3) Mental health concerns. Healthcare professionals, public health systems and the society needs to come together to advocate for these children by optimising access to healthcare and community intervention services, promoting mental well-being and caregiver welfare. The consequences of missed present-day opportunities might only be evident in the years to come in these children. Hence, despite the prolonged pandemic, with consequent limitations in availability of resources, children with developmental disabilities should continue to be supported.","Aishworiya, Kang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-020-04670-6","20200820","Access to care; COVID-19; Children; Developmental delay; Inequities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4042,""
"Acute stress disorder among frontline health professionals during the COVID-19 outbreak: A structural equation modelling investigation","The outbreak of COVID-19 that commenced in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has caused extensive public health concerns and posed substantial challenges to health professionals, especially for those in the center of the epidemic. The current study aimed to assess the prevalence, related factors, and mechanism of Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) among health professionals in Wuhan during this critical period. The study used a cross-sectional design. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the frontline health professionals in Wuhan hospitals from January 28 to February 1, 2020. Mental health related measurements included ASD, depression, anxiety, conflict experiences, hostility, and psychosomatic symptoms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the factors associated with ASD among health professionals. A total of 332 frontline health professionals were included in the analysis (mean age 32.21Ã‚Â±8.77 years; 78.0% women). ASD was a prominent mental health problem in the health professionals surveyed, with a prevalence of 38.3%. Anxiety (24.7%) and depression (20.2%) were also common. SEM analyses revealed that emotional distress (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms) fully mediated the association between conflicts with ASD (the standardized indirect coefficient ÃŽÂ²=0.47, p=0.016). The most common reported symptom was chest pain (51.2%). ASD was significantly associated with psychosomatic symptoms. The majority (67.8%) reported being easily annoyed or irritated and ASD was associated with hostility. During the COVID-19 outbreak, a substantial number of health professionals in Wuhan suffered from ASD. Furthermore, ASD was found to be associated with psychosomatic symptoms as well as the hostility. The poor mental health of health professionals has detrimental impacts both on the wellbeing of staff in healthcare systems and may adversely affect the quality of patient care. We call for interventions that aim to relieve the psychological and occupational stress. Considering most of our participants were young, female frontline health professionals, the results may not be generalized to more heterogenous samples.","Wang, Duan, Peng, Li, Ou, Wilson, Wang, Si, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1097/PSY.0000000000000851","20200820","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4043,""
"Mental Health Care Goes Online: Practitioners' Experiences of Providing Mental Health Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated sudden and radical changes in mental health care delivery, as strict social distancing and lockdown measures were imposed in the early phases of the pandemic. Almost overnight, practitioners were forced to transfer their face-to-face care practice to online means. To understand the implications of this drastic change for mental health care, and to improve the online care offerings, an online qualitative survey was held among mental health care professionals in Netherlands (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51). Our findings indicate that technological and usability problems pose a significant challenge, as do difficulties to establish rapport with clients. Moreover, not all mental health issues and treatment forms are equally amenable to online interaction. In contrast, in many instances, practitioners were positive about the effectiveness of treatment, and reported flexibility, a lower threshold for contact, and lack of travel time as advantages. Their most prominent needs concern better technological, organizational, and logistical support. It is critical that these needs are acted upon by institutions and governments. In addition, current results inform future research on the improvement of e-mental health technologies.","Feijt, de Kort, Bongers, Bierbooms, Westerink, IJsselsteijn","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2020.0370","20200820","COVID-19; e-health; mental health care; online psychological treatment; practitioners' experiences; teletherapy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4044,""
"Psychological responses and lifestyle changes among pregnant women with respect to the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a profound impact on health and well-being of populations. However, there are limited studies that have investigated the psychological aspects of vulnerable groups including pregnant women amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we aimed to assess the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic among Chinese pregnant women from February 2020 until March 2020. Our study was conducted using a modified validated online questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic, the Impact of Event Scale (IES), attitude and mental health-related questions towards COVID-19. A total of 560 women were included. The overall mean age and IES of women was 25.8 Ã‚Â± 2.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and 31.4 Ã‚Â± 13.7. Moreover, 67.1% of them had IES Ã¢Â©Â¾26. Psychological impact seemed to be more severe in women in second trimester of pregnancy (the highest IES) (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.016). There was a significant association between trimesters of pregnancy and some indicators of negative health impacts (including increased stress from work, increased stress from home, feeling apprehensive and helpless during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic) (all <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Our results reported moderate-to-severe stressful impact among Chinese pregnant women. We recommend that appropriate measures should be taken to address the maternal mental health issues.","Zhang, Ma","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020952116","20200820","China; IES; Stress; mental health; pregnant women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4045,""

"Subjective burden and perspectives of German healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare workers (HCW) face tremendous challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about the subjective burden, views, and COVID-19 infection status of HCWs. The aim of this work was toÃ‚Â evaluate the subjective burden, the perception of the information policies, and the agreement on structural measures in a large cohort of German HCW during the COVID-19 pandemic. This country-wide anonymous online survey was carried out from April 15th until May 1st, 2020. 25 content-related questions regarding the subjective burden and other dimensions were evaluated. We evaluated different dimensions of subjective burden, stress, and perspectives using 5-point Likert-scale questions. Moreover, the individual COVID-19 infection status, the amount of people infected in circle of friends and acquaintances and the hours working overtime were assessed. A total of 3669 HCWs provided sufficient responses for analyses. 2.8% of HCWs reported to have been tested positive for COVID-19. Nurses reported in principle higher ratings on all questions of subjective burden and stress than doctors and other hospital staff. Doctors (3.6%) and nurses (3.1%) were more likely to be tested positive for COVID-19 than other hospital staff (0.6%, Chi<sub>(2)</sub><sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.39, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0005). HCWs who worked in a COVID-19 environment reported higher levels of subjective burden and stress compared to all other participants. Working in a COVID-19 environment increased the likelihood to be tested positive for COVID-19 (4.8% vs. 2.3%, Chi<sub>(1)</sub><sup>2</sup> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.62, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0005) and the severity of the subjective burden. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses experience more stress than doctors. Overall, German HCWs showed high scores of agreement with the measures taken by the hospitals.","Kramer, Papazova, Thoma, Kunz, Falkai, Schneider-Axmann, Hierundar, Wagner, Hasan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-020-01183-2","20200820","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Pandemic; Personal burden; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-08-22","",4047,""
