"Psychological effect of COVID-19 pandemic among women undergoing infertility care, a French cohort - PsyCovART Psychological effect of COVID-19: PsyCovART","To assess psychological state of women who experienced postponement of ART care during the first COVID-19 wave in a French public ward of reproductive medicine. An online anonymous survey was emailed between July and August 2020 to all women whose infertility care, including the first consultation for infertility, have been delayed at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, and stress were assessed using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). Feelings about COVID-19 outbreak, lockdown and suspension of fertility care were assessed by Multiple-Choice Questions and Visual Analog Scales. 435 women answered to the survey (response rate 34.6%). Mean levels of the HADS-A (anxiety), HADS-D (depression) and PSS10 were respectively 7.58(Ã‚Â±3.85), 4.51(Ã‚Â±3.48), and 27(Ã‚Â±6.75). Prevalence of stress was 50.8% and almost half of women presented clear or suggestive anxiety symptoms (respectively 21.6% and 25.7%). Stress and anxiety rates were much higher than those expected in infertile population. Increased stress was observed in women above 35 years and those stopped 'in cycle' or during pre-treatment for in-vitro fertilization or frozen embryo transfer. Patient with history of depression or anxiety had a higher prevalence of perceived stress (p= 0.0006). Postponement was perceived as 'unbearable' for women experiencing stress (p=0.0032). After the first wave of pandemic, pregnancy desire remained the same and 84.3% of women wanted to resume fertility care as soon as possible. Stopping fertility care during the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant psychological impact on women with an increase of stress, and anxiety. Psychological counseling should always be offered especially during this difficult period.","Lablanche, Salle, Perie, Labrune, Langlois-Jacques, Fraison","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jogoh.2021.102251","20211012","ART; Anxiety; COVID-19; Infertility; Mental health; Psychological effect; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18767,""

"Treatment of overdose in the synthetic opioid era","Overdose deaths are often viewed as the leading edge of the opioid epidemic which has gripped the United States over the past two decades (Skolnick, 2018a). This emphasis is perhaps unsurprising because opioid overdose is both the number-one cause of death for individuals between 25 and 64Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years old (Dezfulian et al., 2021) and a significant contributor to the decline in average lifespan (Dowell et al., 2017). Exacerbated by the COVID 19 pandemic, it was estimated there were 93,400 drug overdose deaths in the United States during the 12Ã¢â‚¬Â¯months ending December 2020, with more than 69,000 (that is, &gt;74%) of these fatalities attributed to opioid overdose (Ahmad et al., 2021). However, the focus on mortality statistics (Ahmad et al., 2021; Shover et al., 2020) tends to obscure the broader medical impact of nonfatal opioid overdose. Analyses of multiple databases indicate that for each opioid-induced fatality, there are between 6.4 and 8.4 non-fatal overdoses, exacting a significant burden on both the individual and society. Over the past 7-8Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years, there has been an alarming increase in the misuse of synthetic opioids (""synthetics""), primarily fentanyl and related piperidine-based analogs. Within the past 2-3Ã¢â‚¬Â¯years, a structurally unrelated class of high potency synthetics, benzimidazoles exemplified by etonitazene and isotonitazene (""iso""), have also appeared in illicit drug markets (Thompson, 2020; Ujvary et al. 2021). In 2020, it was estimated that over 80% of fatal opioid overdoses in the United States now involve synthetics (Ahmad et al., 2021). The unique physicochemical and pharmacological properties of synthetics described in this review are responsible for both the morbidity and mortality associated with their misuse as well as their widespread availability. This dramatic increase in the misuse of synthetics is often referred to as the ""3rd wave"" (Pardo et al., 2019; Volkow and Blanco, 2020) of the opioid epidemic. Among the consequences resulting from misuse of these potent opioids is the need for higher doses of the competitive antagonist, naloxone, to reverse an overdose. The development of more effective reversal agents such as those described in this review is an essential component of a tripartite strategy (Volkow and Collins, 2017) to reduce the biopsychosocial impact of opioid misuse in the ""synthetic era"".","Skolnick","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2021.108019","20211012","Benzimidazoles; Fentanyl; Nalmefene; Naloxone; Naltrexone; Opioid antagonist","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18769,""
"Behavioural activation to prevent depression and loneliness among socially isolated older people with long-term conditions: The BASIL COVID-19 pilot randomised controlled trial","Older adults, including those with long-term conditions (LTCs), are vulnerable to social isolation. They are likely to have become more socially isolated during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, often due to advice to ""shield"" to protect them from infection. This places them at particular risk of depression and loneliness. There is a need for brief scalable psychosocial interventions to mitigate the psychological impacts of social isolation. Behavioural activation (BA) is a credible candidate intervention, but a trial is needed. We undertook an external pilot parallel randomised trial (ISRCTN94091479) designed to test recruitment, retention and engagement with, and the acceptability and preliminary effects of the intervention. Participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65 years with 2 or more LTCs were recruited in primary care and randomised by computer and with concealed allocation between June and October 2020. BA was offered to intervention participants (n = 47), and control participants received usual primary care (n = 49). Assessment of outcome was made blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was depression severity (measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)). We also measured health-related quality of life (measured by the Short Form (SF)-12v2 mental component scale (MCS) and physical component scale (PCS)), anxiety (measured by the Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7)), perceived social and emotional loneliness (measured by the De Jong Gierveld Scale: 11-item loneliness scale). Outcome was measured at 1 and 3 months. The mean age of participants was aged 74 years (standard deviation (SD) 5.5) and they were mostly White (n = 92, 95.8%), and approximately two-thirds of the sample were female (n = 59, 61.5%). Remote recruitment was possible, and 45/47 (95.7%) randomised to the intervention completed 1 or more sessions (median 6 sessions) out of 8. A total of 90 (93.8%) completed the 1-month follow-up, and 86 (89.6%) completed the 3-month follow-up, with similar rates for control (1 month: 45/49 and 3 months 44/49) and intervention (1 month: 45/47and 3 months: 42/47) follow-up. Between-group comparisons were made using a confidence interval (CI) approach, and by adjusting for the covariate of interest at baseline. At 1 month (the primary clinical outcome point), the median number of completed sessions for people receiving the BA intervention was 3, and almost all participants were still receiving the BA intervention. The between-group comparison for the primary clinical outcome at 1 month was an adjusted between-group mean difference of -0.50 PHQ-9 points (95% CI -2.01 to 1.01), but only a small number of participants had completed the intervention at this point. At 3 months, the PHQ-9 adjusted mean difference (AMD) was 0.19 (95% CI -1.36 to 1.75). When we examined loneliness, the adjusted between-group difference in the De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale at 1 month was 0.28 (95% CI -0.51 to 1.06) and at 3 months -0.87 (95% CI -1.56 to -0.18), suggesting evidence of benefit of the intervention at this time point. For anxiety, the GAD adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.20 (-1.33, 1.73) and at 3 months 0.31 (-1.08, 1.70). For the SF-12 (physical component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 0.34 (-4.17, 4.85) and at 3 months 0.11 (-4.46, 4.67). For the SF-12 (mental component score), the adjusted between-group difference at 1 month was 1.91 (-2.64, 5.15) and at 3 months 1.26 (-2.64, 5.15). Participants who withdrew had minimal depressive symptoms at entry. There were no adverse events. The Behavioural Activation in Social Isolation (BASIL) study had 2 main limitations. First, we found that the intervention was still being delivered at the prespecified primary outcome point, and this fed into the design of the main trial where a primary outcome of 3 months is now collected. Second, this was a pilot trial and was not designed to test between-group differences with high levels of statistical power. Type 2 errors are likely to have occurred, and a larger trial is now underway to test for robust effects and replicate signals of effectiveness in important secondary outcomes such as loneliness. In this study, we observed that BA is a credible intervention to mitigate the psychological impacts of COVID-19 isolation for older adults. We demonstrated that it is feasible to undertake a trial of BA. The intervention can be delivered remotely and at scale, but should be reserved for older adults with evidence of depressive symptoms. The significant reduction in loneliness is unlikely to be a chance finding, and replication will be explored in a fully powered randomised controlled trial (RCT).

"Online synchronous Focus Groups and research continuity during the COVID-19 pandemic: Using technology to adapt a mental health intervention for Colombian adolescents","Although focus groups are a valuable qualitative research tool, face-to-face meetings may be difficult to arrange and time consuming. This has been further compounded by the COVID-19 global pandemic, where the subsequent lockdown and physical distancing measures implemented, caused exceptional challenges to all human activity. Online Focus Groups (OFGs) are an example of one alternative strategy, requiring investigation. At present, OFGs have mostly been studied and used in high-income countries with little information relating to their implementation in Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Our aim is to share our experiences of conducting OFGs through a web conferencing service and provide recommendations for future research. As part of a broader study, OFGs were developed with adults and adolescents in Colombia during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a convenience sampling method, we invited eligible participants via e-mail in two different cities of Colombia to take part in OFGs conducted via Microsoft TeamsÃ‚Â®. Researcher notes and discussion were used to capture the participant and facilitator experiences as well as practical considerations. We conducted 10 OFGs with a total of 45 participants. Data obtained met our expectations and the online methodology did not compromise the quality of our results. Technical issues arose but different measures were taken to minimize them: using a web conferencing service that was familiar to participants, sending written instructions and performing a trial meeting prior to the OFG. Adolescent participants unlike their adult counterparts, were fluent in using web conferencing platforms and did not encounter technical challenges. OFGs have great potential in research settings especially during the current and any future public health emergencies. It is important to keep in mind that even with the advantages that they offer, technical issues (i.e., internet speed and access to technology) are major obstacles in LMICs. Further research is required and should carefully consider the appropriateness of OFGs in different settings.","Calvo-Valderrama, MarroquÃƒÂ­n-Rivera, Burn, Ospina-Pinillos, Bird, GÃƒÂ³mez-Restrepo","https://doi.org/10.2196/30293","20211012","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18771,""
"Letter to the Editor: THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS","Dear Editor, The Covid-19 pandemic affected human life globally, inducing much stress on daily living (Ãƒâ€¡akÃ„Â±roÃ„Å¸lu et al. 2020). Although assessments of general mental health during the Covid-19 pandemic have been widely reported, there is not adequate research on how schizophrenia patients have been affected. According to the World Health Organization (2020), individuals with chronic diseases who do not pay attention to their personal hygiene and the rules of protection from COVID-19 have a higher risk of getting infected than the healthy individuals who observe these measures. It is well known that the risk of Covid-19 infection is raised among schizophrenia patients due to negligence on the requisite control of personal hygiene and health conditions related to smoking and diabetes ( Cohn et al., 2004; Dinan et al., 2004; Krieger et al. 2019). The cognitive impairment in this disorder which reduces the perceptions on the necessity of self protection and the awareness of the risks proposed to underlie this raised risk of COVID-19 positivity (Yao et al. 2020). These patients have difficulty in following the preventive regulations (Palomar-Ciria et al., 2020). Apart from the risk of infection, there is also the risk of pandemic related development of auditory or visual hallucinations and delusional symptoms by acute and chronic psychosis patients during and after the pandemic (Brown et al. 2020, Cowan 2020). Therefore, this survey has been organised to evaluate the reaction developed by schizophrenia patients to the pandemic conditions. The first Covid-19 case was reported in Turkey on 11 March 2020 (Anadolu Agency, 11.03.2020) which was followed by the gradual increase in case numbers. In order to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and maintain the existing public health, the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Health established a 'Scientific Committee'' and prepared effective strategies including social isolation, quarantine, school closures, social distancing and wearing face mask in the community. During this process, the approximately 250 schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder patients followed up by the Psychosis Outpatient Unit of Dokuz Eylul University Hospital Psychiatry Department (DEUPD) were instructed to visit the outpatient unit only in emergency conditions. It was determined that there were 176 schizophrenia patients whose follow up visit appointments for the period of April 1 - June 22, 2020, scheduled before the announcement of the pandemic, were cancelled. Therefore, the survey reported here was conducted with the schizophrenia patients of the DEUPD online and by telephone connections during 10- 20 May, 2020, the 9th and the 10th weeks of the pandemic. Only 76 (43.19%) of the 176 patients joined the survey, since 4 (2.27%) refused to participate and 96 (54.4%) could not be contacted. The survey aimed to determine the incidence of Covid-19 diagnosis among these schizophrenia patients and their attitude to the preventive measures against the infection during the first 2 months of the pandemic, together with how they felt and their needs for psychiatric consultation on outpatient basis during this period. The surveyed 76 patients consisted of 49 (64%) males and 27 (35%) females, with 73 (96.1%) dwelling in urban and 3 (3.9%) in suburban areas; and only 11 (14.5%) employed while 65 (85.5%) were not working. Only two patients reported consulting emergency services for Covid-19 symptoms. The rest of the patients did not report consulting a healthcare facility for suspecting Covid-19 symptoms or Ã‚ Table 1. Data on the demographic, clinical and social features of the schizophrenia patients during the COVID-19 pandemic Ã‚ n=76 Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Mean SD Ã‚ Gender (F/M) 27 (35.5%) / 49 (64.5%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Age Ã‚ 44.54 12.21 Ã‚ Disease duration Ã‚ 16.62 9.96 Ã‚ Patients living /with Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Alone Ã‚ 3 (3.9%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Parent(s) Ã‚ 43 (56.6%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Spouse/children 25 (32.9%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Sibling (s) 1 (1.3%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Relative(s) 2 (2.6%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Friend(s) Ã‚ 2 (2.6%) Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Yes No Need to see a psychiatrist Ã‚ Ã‚ 23 (30.3%) 53 (69.7%) Subjective psychiatric complaints Ã‚ Ã‚ 32 (42.1%) 44 (57.9%) Consultation with an emergency service Ã‚ Ã‚ 2 (2.6%) 74 (97.4%) Planning to go to the hospital in the post-quarantine period Ã‚ 58 (76.3%) 18 (23.7%) Wearing a mask in community Ã‚ Ã‚ 67 (88.2%) 4 (5.3%) Keeping social distancing Ã‚ Ã‚ 68 (89.5%) 3 (3.9%) Expressed feeling Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Ã‚ Loneliness Ã‚ 26 (34.2%) 49 (64.5%) Depressed Ã‚ 31 (40.8%) 44 (57.9%) Despaired Ã‚ 22 (28.9%) 52 (68.4%) Anxious Ã‚ Ã‚ 25 (32.9%) 49 (64.5%) Difficulty of going to the hospital in the quarantine period Ã‚ 53 (69.7%) 23 (30.3%) Ã‚ hospital admission for Covid-19 infection or psychotic attack or incidences of Covid-19 related hallucination or delusions. During this 2-month period, 4 patients had experienced fatigue, 2 had episodes of dry cough and 7 had experienced shortness of breath, which can be associated with the nature of schizophrenia, the sedentary life style.and cigarette smoking. Medication was prescribed by a psychiatrist for 10 patients and by a family doctor for 16 patients or supplied directly by pharmacies for 45 patients on the basis of prescriptions with 1-year validity issued by the hospital* (Table 1). Much as it had been aimed to contact all patients with cancelled appointments, this objective was not attainable The patients who were not reached are likely to include those with low awareness and difficulty of adapting to infection prevention strategies. On the other hand, regardless of the level of awareness of the pandemic and compliance with the rules, phone use by these patients might have been limited by economic and environmental reasons, as well as the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. In conclusion, it is possible to say that most of the patients with schizophrenia were aware of the risk of COVID-19 infection, and understood and mostly obeyed the general health rules and advices of healthcare professionals even if they had difficulty in doing so. This could also have resulted from the nature of schizophrenia with preference for social isolation even if this can worsen the prognosis. On the other hand, patients need to be in contact with a mental healthcare professional in extraordinary situations of a pandemic. This survey did not find a remarkable increase in positive symptom severity in association with COVID-19 as most patients included in the survey had not seen a psychiatrist or mental healthcare professional for two months with 53 patients stating that they did not have to need.Ã‚ Ã‚Â However, 58 patients also stated that despite planning to make a consultation after normalization of the quarantine measures, the anxiety of contagion outweighed the option of visiting outpatient clinics. This anxiety over Covid-19 infection, however, may make it difficult for patients to understand the level of the need to see a psychiatrist and may be associated with the assumption that the pandemic would be taken under control in the normalization process with a decrease in the risk of contagion. On the results of this survey, it may be concluded that strategies for prevention of COVID-19 spread were effective among schizophrenia patients and that there is need to develop a system that reaches all patients and keeps them socially connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. *In Turkey, prescription reports with 1-year validity are issued for patients with chronic disorders. The medications can only be prescribed by a specialist, and in the case of pyshchiatric disorders, by a consultant psychiatrist. When the report is confirmed by a hospital committee of specialists, a family doctor is able to issue prescriptions. According to the decision of the Ministry of Health, patients who have medication prescription reports valid for one year would be able to get their medicines directly from pharmacies without having to consult a psychiatrist or family doctor during the pandemic.

"Quality of life and mental health in children and adolescents during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic: results of a two-wave nationwide population-based study","The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of children and adolescents worldwide. The German COPSY study is among the first population-based longitudinal studies to examine the mental health impact of the pandemic. The objective of the study was to assess changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental health in children and adolescents and to identify the associated risk and resource factors during the pandemic. A nationwide longitudinal survey was conducted with two waves during the pandemic (May/June 2020 and December 2020/January 2021). In total, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1923 children and adolescents aged 7 to 17Ã‚Â years and their parents participated (retention rate from wave 1 to wave 2: 85%). The self-report and parent-proxy surveys assessed HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10), mental health problems (SDQ with the subscales emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems), anxiety (SCARED), depressive symptoms (CES-DC, PHQ-2) and psychosomatic complaints (HBSC-SCL). Mixed model panel regression analyses were conducted to examine longitudinal changes in mental health and to identify risk and resource factors. The HRQoL of children and adolescents decreased during the pandemic, and emotional problems, peer-related mental health problems, anxiety, depressive and psychosomatic symptoms increased over time, however the change in global mental health problems from wave 1 to wave 2 was not significant, and some changes were negligible. Socially disadvantaged children and children of mentally burdened parents were at particular risk of impaired mental health, while female gender and older age were associated with fewer mental health problems. A positive family climate and social support supported the mental health of children and adolescents during the pandemic. Health promotion, prevention and intervention strategies could support children and adolescents in coping with the pandemic and protect and maintain their mental health.","Ravens-Sieberer, Kaman, Erhart, Otto, Devine, LÃƒÂ¶ffler, Hurrelmann, Bullinger, Barkmann, Siegel, Simon, Wieler, Schlack, HÃƒÂ¶lling","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01889-1","20211012","Anxiety; COVID-19; Children and adolescents; Depression; Mental health; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18773,""
"Potential therapeutic effect and methods of traditional Chinese medicine on COVID-19-induced depression: A review","COVID-19 (coronavirus) has spread all over the world with a high infection rate. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic drugs for COVID-19 as well as for stress induced by COVID-19. The unpredictable events of COVID-19 can trigger feelings of fear, worry, or unease in people, leading to stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety. It has been reported that individuals, including COVID-19 patients, medical staff, and ordinary people, are under both physical and psychological pressure, and many of them have developed depression or anxiety during this pandemic. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely used in treating depression with relatively better safety and efficacy and may have an important role in treating stress-related disorders induced by COVID-19. In this review, we collected the common TCM treatment methods including Qigong, Acupuncture, Five Elements Musical Therapy, Five Elements Emotional Therapy, and Chinese herbal medicine from the databases of PubMed and the China National Knowledge Internet to illustrate the effect of TCM on depression. The better knowledge of TCM and implementation of TCM in COVID-19 clinics may help to effectively improve depression induced by COVID-19, may assist people to maintain a healthy physical and mental quality, and may alleviate the current shortage of medical resources.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress experienced by Australian nurses","Globally, the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers' mental health has been a major focus of recent research. However, Australian research involving nurses, particularly across the acute care sector, is limited. This cross-sectional research aimed to explore the impact of pandemic-related stress on psychological adjustment outcomes and potential protective factors for nurses (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 767) working in the Australian acute care sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses completed an online questionnaire with psychometrically validated measures of pandemic-related stress, psychological adjustment outcomes (depression, anxiety, and subjective well-being), and protective factors (posttraumatic growth and self-compassion). Descriptive analyses revealed that pandemic-related stress was reported by 17.7% of the participants. Psychological adjustment outcome scores above normal for depression (27.5%) and anxiety (22.0%) were found, and 36.4% of the participants reported poor subjective well-being. Regression analyses suggest that pandemic-related stress predicted greater depression (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.32, SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.02, 95% confidence interval [0.28, 0.35]) and anxiety (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.26, SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01, 95% confidence interval [0.24, 0.29]) and less subjective well-being (BÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.14, SEÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.01, 95% confidence interval [-0.16, -0.12]). Self-compassion weakened the relationship between pandemic-related stress and greater depression, however, exacerbated the relationship between pandemic-related stress and less subjective well-being. Posttraumatic growth reduced the negative relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychological adjustment outcomes. These findings will inform strategies to facilitate psychological resources that support nurses' psychological adjustment, enabling better pandemic preparedness at both an individual and organizational level.","Aggar, Samios, Penman, Whiteing, Massey, Rafferty, Bowen, Stephens","https://doi.org/10.1111/inm.12938","20211012","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; nurses; posttraumatic growth; psychological","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18775,""
"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on brain metabolism","This study aims to evaluate the impact of French national lockdown of 55Ã¢â‚¬â€°days on brain metabolism of patients with neurological disorders. Whole-brain voxel-based PET analysis was used to correlate <sup>18</sup> F-FDG metabolism to the number of days after March 17, 2020 (in 95 patients; mean age: 54.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°years Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.7; 59 men), in comparison to the same period in 2019 before the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (in 212 patients; mean age: 59.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.8; 114 men), and to the first 55Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of deconfinement (in 188 patients; mean age: 57.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.5; 93 men). Lockdown duration was negatively correlated to the metabolism of the sensory-motor cortex with a prevailing effect on the left dominant pyramidal tract and on younger patients, also including the left amygdala, with only partial reversibility after 55Ã¢â‚¬â€°days of deconfinement. Weak overlap was found with the reported pattern of hypometabolism in long COVID (&lt;9%). Restriction of physical activities, and possible related deconditioning, and social isolation may lead to functional disturbances of sensorimotor and emotional brain networks. Of note, this metabolic pattern seems distinct to those reported in long COVID. Further longitudinal studies with longer follow-up are needed to evaluate clinical consequences and relationships on cognitive and mental health against functional deactivation hypothesis, and to extend these findings to healthy subjects in the context of lockdown.","Guedj, Campion, Horowitz, Barthelemy, Cammilleri, Ceccaldi","https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25673","20211012","COVID-19; FDG-PET; SARS-CoV-2; brain metabolism; deconditioning; deconfinement; lockdown; long COVID; physical activities; pyramidal tract","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18776,""
"Frequency and characteristics of advanced cancer patients with COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ve status among inpatient supportive care consults during the pandemic: experience from a tertiary cancer center","There is limited literature available regards the frequency and characteristics of COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ve status among advanced cancer patients referred to an inpatient supportive care consultation(PC) at a tertiary cancer center. Our study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ve cancer patients seen by PC. Advanced cancer patients seen as a consult by PC between June 15 and September 25, 2020, at MD Anderson Cancer Center were eligible for the study. We evaluated the patient demographics, clinical characteristics including symptoms(ESAS), delirium(MDAS), COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°status prior to, and after PC referral(converters), and type of PC delivery(in person or virtual care). Sixty-six out of 1380 (4.8%) PC consults were COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ve: 42 prior to PC (79%), and 14 (21%) were COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ve after the PC (converters). COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°PC patients had lower depression (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.035), spiritual distress (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003), and were more seen frequently virtually (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). There was no significant difference between COVID-19-ve patients and converters. Converters had higher symptom distress (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007), lower delirium (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014), and were referred earlier (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.011) compared to COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°PC patients diagnosed prior to PC consult. Overall, patients seen virtually compared in-person by PC were younger (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02) and had lower delirium (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.007). The burden of COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°status among patients referred to PC was low. COVID-19Ã¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°ve patients had more frequent virtual visits, lower depression, and spiritual distress scores. Patient seen virtually were significantly younger and had lower delirium. During a new pandemic, universal virtual care might be emphasized especially at initial encounters after admission and further research is needed on the potential efficacy of this intervention.","Yennurajalingam, Lu, Chen, Bruera","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00520-021-06525-x","20211012","COVID-19; Cancer symptoms; Palliative care; Supportive cancer care; Virtual care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18777,""
"Persistent depressive symptoms during COVID-19: a national, population-representative, longitudinal study of US adults","The COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences have been associated with an increase in poor population mental health. We assessed how depressive symptoms changed among U.S. adults over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic and identified the key risk factors for these symptoms. Longitudinal panel study of a nationally representative group of U.S. adults ages 18 years and older surveyed in March-April 2020 (Time 1; N=1441) and March-April 2021 (Time 2; N=1161) in the COVID-19 and Life Stressors Impact on Mental Health and Well-being study (CLIMB). The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) was used to define elevated depressive symptoms (cut-off Ã¢â€°Â¥10) and depressive symptoms score (0-27). The prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms persisted from 27.8% in 2020 (95% CI: 24.9, 30.9) to 32.8% in 2021 (95% CI: 29.1, 36.8). Over time, the central drivers of depressive symptoms were low household income, not being married, and experiencing multiple stressors during the COVID-19 pandemic. The odds ratio of elevated depressive symptoms for low income relative to high income persons increased from 2.3 (95% CI: 1.2, 4.2) in 2020 to 7.0 (95% CI: 3.7, 13.3) in 2021. Fewer people reported experiencing 4 or more COVID-19 stressors in 2021 than in 2020 (47.5% in 2020 vs 37.1% in 2021), but the odds ratio of elevated depressive symptoms associated with 4 or more stressors relative to 1 stressor or less increased from 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.1) in 2020 to 5.4 (95% CI: 3.2, 9.2) in 2021. The burden of depressive symptoms in the U.S. adult population increased over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mental health gaps grew between populations with different assets and stressor experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Quality of life in elderly ICU survivors before the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies","The influence of age on intensive care unit (ICU) decision-making is complex, and it is unclear if it is based on expected subjective or objective patient outcomes. To address recent concerns over age-based ICU decision-making, we explored patient-assessed quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors before the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies published between January 2000 and April 2020, of elderly patients admitted to ICUs. We extracted data on self-reported QoL (EQ-5D composite score), demographic and clinical variables. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we then compared QoL scores at follow-up to scores either before admission, age-matched population controls or younger ICU survivors. We conducted sensitivity analyses to study heterogeneity and bias and a qualitative synthesis of subscores. We identified 2536 studies and included 22 for qualitative synthesis and 18 for meta-analysis (n=2326 elderly survivors). Elderly survivors' QoL was significantly worse than younger ICU survivors, with a small-to-medium effect size (d=0.35 (-0.53 and -0.16)). Elderly survivors' QoL was also significantly greater when measured slightly before ICU, compared with follow-up, with a small effect size (d=0.26 (-0.44 and -0.08)). Finally, their QoL was also marginally significantly worse than age-matched community controls, also with a small effect size (d=0.21 (-0.43 and 0.00)). Mortality rates and length of follow-up partly explained heterogeneity. Reductions in QoL seemed primarily due to physical health, rather than mental health items. The results suggest that the proportionality of age as a determinant of ICU resource allocation should be kept under close review and that subjective QoL outcomes should inform person-centred decision -aking in elderly ICU patients.

"The feasibility of home monitoring of young people with cystic fibrosis: Results from CLIMB-CF","CF is traditionally assessed in clinic. It is unclear if home monitoring of young people with CF is feasible or acceptable. The COVID-19 pandemic has made home monitoring more of a necessity. We report the results of CLIMB-CF, exploring home monitoring's feasibility and potential obstacles. We designed a mobile app and enrolled participants with CF aged 2-17 years and their parents for six months. They were asked to complete a variety of measures either daily or twice a week. During the study, participants and their parents completed questionnaires exploring depression, anxiety and quality of life. At the end of the study parents and participants completed acceptability questionnaires. 148 participants were recruited, 4 withdrew prior to starting the study. 82 participants were female with median (IQR) age 7.9 (5.2-12 years). Median data completeness was 40.1% (13.6-69.9%) for the whole cohort; when assessed by age participants aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 12 years contributed significantly less (15.6% [9.8-30%]). Data completeness decreased over time. There was no significant difference between parental depression and anxiety scores at the start and the end of the study nor in CFQ-R respiratory domain scores for participants Ã¢â€°Â¥ 14 years. The majority of participants did not feel the introduction of home monitoring impacted their daily lives. Most participants felt home monitoring did not negatively impact their lives and it did not increase depression, anxiety or decrease quality of life. However, uptake was variable, and not well sustained. The teenage years pose a particular challenge and further work is required.","Edmondson, Westrupp, Seddon, Olden, Wallis, Dawson, Brodlie, Baxter, McCormick, MacFarlane, Rice, Macleod, Brooker, Connon, Ghayyda, Blaikie, Thursfield, Brown, Price, Fleischer, Itterman, Hughes, Barrett, Surette, Donnelly, Mateos-Corral, Padley, Wallenburg, Brownlee, Alton, Bush, Davies","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcf.2021.09.018","20211012","Anxiety; Depression; Digital technology; Feasibility; Home monitoring","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18780,""
"Distance learning, technological devices, lifestyle and behavior of children and their family during the COVID-19 lockdown in Lombardy: a survey","The COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent national lockdowns, school closures and distance learning may have had both negative and positiveÃ‚Â effects on physical and mental health of children. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a large group of children between 1 and 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old in Lombardy, Italy (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3392). Their parents filled in a survey answering single or multiple-choice questions about their offspring's behavior changes (including sleep, dietary habits, emotional disturbances), relationship with siblings, parents and peers, the use of digital technologies, and distance learning experience during the lockdown. Parents reported lifestyles and emotional alterations during the lockdown. The modifications of family relationships, parents' remote working, and screen time were associated with sleep, emotional and behavioral modifications. Distance learning was overall considered adequate. This study reported the most updated data on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on children between 1 and 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age in a large sample of Italian schoolchildren.

"Depression in public officials during the COVID-19 pandemic in Paraguay: a web-based study","According to the World Health Organization, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has created situations that have a negative effect on people and threaten their mental health. Paraguay announced the Estado de Emergencia Sanitaria (Presidential Decree No. 3456) on March 16, 2020, which was followed by the imposition of a 24-h restriction on movement order on March 21. Self-quarantine at home may have been the most effective method of preventing the spread of infectious diseases; however, with the global pandemic becoming more prolonged and the consequent lengthening of the 24-h self-quarantine period, it is highly probable that both physical and psychological problems will arise. In this study, a web-based cross-sectional method was used to analyze the factors influencing COVID-19-induced depressive feelings in Paraguayan public officials. Public officials reported a high level of depressive symptoms with a high level of apprehension in early stage of COVID-19. In addition, this study identified that when the self-quarantine period increased, levels of depressive feelings also increased. Since self-quarantine is characterized by the requirement that individuals endure an undetermined period within a confined area, it may have caused stress and anxiety, as well as the consequent experience of depressive feelings. Paraguayan government should develop a program for the delivery of mental health care and services to public officials in COVID-19 Pandemic period. Moreover, a program is required for people facing deteriorating mental health due to social isolation and loneliness caused by social distancing during the prolonged period of self-quarantine. Finally, mental health care programs should be organized in a community-focused way by utilizing online systems to enhance the effectiveness of mental health recovery.","Kim, Lee, Kang, Lee, Shin, RÃƒÂ¶nnebeck, RÃƒÂ¶nnebeck, Nam","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11860-z","20211012","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Mental health; Paraguay; Self-quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18782,""
"A multicenter study of short-term changes in mental health emergency services use during lockdown in Kitchener-Waterloo, Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown measures have led to increasing mental health concerns in the general population. We aimed to assess the short-term impact of the pandemic lockdown on mental health emergency services use in the Kitchener-Waterloo region of Ontario, Canada. We conducted an observational study during the 6-month period between March 5 and September 5, 2020 using National Ambulatory Care Reporting System metadata from mental health visits to three regional Emergency Departments (ED); mental health and substance related police calls; and calls to a regional mental health crisis telephone line, comparing volumes during the pandemic lockdown with the same period in 2019. Quasi-Poisson regressions were used to determine significant differences between numbers of each visit or call type during the lockdown period versus the previous year. Significant changes in ED visits, mental health diagnoses, police responses, and calls to the crisis line from March 5 to September 5, 2020 were examined using changepoint analyses. Involuntary admissions, substance related visits, mood related visits, situational crisis visits, and self-harm related mental health visits to the EDs were significantly reduced during the lockdown period compared to the year before. Psychosis-related and alcohol-related visits were not significantly reduced. Among police calls, suicide attempts were significantly decreased during the period of lockdown, but intoxication, assault, and domestic disputes were not significantly different. Mental health crisis telephone calls were significantly decreased during the lockdown period. There was a significant increase in weekly mental health diagnoses starting in the week of July 12 - July 18. There was a significant increase in crisis calls starting in the week of May 31 - June 6, the same week that many guidelines, such as gathering restrictions, were eased. There was a significant increase in weekly police responses starting in the week of June 14 - June 20. Contrary to our hypothesis, the decrease in most types of mental health ED visits, mental health and substance-related police calls, and mental health crisis calls largely mirrored the overall decline in emergency services usage during the lockdown period. This finding is unexpected in the context of increased attention to acutely deteriorating mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Dainton, Donato-Woodger, Chu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-11807-4","20211012","COVID-19; Lockdown; Pandemic; Psychiatric emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18783,""
"The psychological and emotional impact of coronavirus disease on COVID-19 patients in Najran Province, Saudi Arabia: An exploratory study","The COVID-19 pandemic contributes to a significant mental health crisis. This pandemic caused a widening economic crisis, growing financial loss, and numerous uncertainties. This pandemic brought alarming implications and overall increased risk for psychiatric illness. This study explores the psychological impact experienced by patients who tested positive from coronavirus disease in the Najran region, Saudi Arabia. This exploratory analysis included 210 COVID-19 positive patients. The study was conducted during a six month period starting from March to September 2020, in two tertiary government hospitals in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Samples were selected using purposive sampling. The researches utilized survey questionnaire and face-to-face interview to collect the data. The statistical data were calculated using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 2.0 to compute the following statistical formulas: percentage distribution, mean, standard deviation, and Chi-square test of independence. The findings of this study revealed that the majority of COVID-19 positive patients were middle-aged adults (n=98 or 46.7%), male (n=178 or 84.8%), and were non-Saudi nationals (n=132 or 62.9%). It was found out that COVID-19 patients experienced bothersome behaviour at a very high level (xÃŒâ€¦=2.63 Ã‚Â± 0.6734). Meanwhile, depression (xÃŒâ€¦=2.51 Ã‚Â± 0.7070), worry (xÃŒâ€¦=2.23 Ã‚Â± 0.8811), and anxiety (xÃŒâ€¦=2.21 Ã‚Â± 0.8719) was only at a high level. The study findings revealed that the majority of participants had high levels of depression, anxiety and bothersome behaviours. However, demographic characteristics like age, sex, and nationality were not significantly related to coronavirus patients' psychological health problems during the pandemic. Assessment and interventions for psychosocial concerns, integration of mental health considerations, consultation with specialists, and treatment for severe psychosocial consequences must be administered in COVID-19 care facilities.","Ghazwani, Alayed, Al-Qahtani, Abdulla, Qureshi, Al-Khadher, Alwesabi, Alshehri, Almas, Khorshid","https://doi.org/10.4081/jphr.2021.2343","20211012","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-13","",18784,""
