"Design and Analysis of Outcomes following SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Veterans","AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSUnderstanding how SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts long-term patient outcomes requires identification of comparable persons with and without infection. We report the design and implementation of a matching strategy employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) COVID-19 Observational Research Collaboratory (CORC) to develop comparable cohorts of SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected persons for the purpose of inferring potential causative long-term adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Veteran population.

MethodsIn a retrospective cohort study, we identified VA health care system patients who were and were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 on a rolling monthly basis. We generated matched cohorts utilizing a combination of exact and time-varying propensity score matching based on electronic health record (EHR)-derived covariates that can be confounders or risk factors across a range of outcomes.

ResultsFrom an initial pool of 126,689,864 person-months of observation, we generated final matched cohorts of 208,536 Veterans infected between March 2020-April 2021 and 3,014,091 uninfected Veterans. Matched cohorts were well-balanced on all 38 covariates used in matching after excluding patients for: no VA health care utilization; implausible age, weight, or height; living outside of the 50 states or Washington, D.C.; prior SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis per Medicare claims; or lack of a suitable match. Most Veterans in the matched cohort were male (88.3%), non-Hispanic (87.1%), white (67.2%), and living in urban areas (71.5%), with a mean age of 60.6, BMI of 31.3, Gagne comorbidity score of 1.4 and a mean of 2.3 CDC high-risk conditions. The most common diagnoses were hypertension (61.4%), diabetes (34.3%), major depression (32.2%), coronary heart disease (28.5%), PTSD (25.5%), anxiety (22.5%), and chronic kidney disease (22.5%).

ConclusionsThis successful creation of matched SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected patient cohorts from the largest integrated health system in the United States will support cohort studies of outcomes derived from EHRs and sample selection for qualitative interviews and patient surveys. These studies will increase our understanding of the long-term outcomes of Veterans who were infected with SARS-CoV-2.","Valerie A. Smith; Theodore S.Z. Berkowitz; Paul Hebert; Edwin S.

"A survey of Eutylone Prevalence in New Zealand during 2020 and 2021","Aim This study provides an insight into the prevalence of eutylone in New Zealand by analysis of the post-mortem forensic toxicology cases over the period 2020 and 2021, as well as analysis of suspected drug items collected from three music festivals between December 2020 and February 2021. Eutylone, also known as bk-EBDB or n-ethylbutylone, is a synthetic cathinone that has no known therapeutic use. In New Zealand it is sold recreationally as an alternative to methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and has increasingly been found as an adulterant or substitution substance in MDMA samples. Eutylone is known to cause harm and has been associated with fatalities [World Health Organization. â€œWHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence: forty-fourth report.â€ (2022)]. In many cases, users are unaware that the eutylone is present believing they are taking MDMA. Method ESR undertakes post-mortem forensic toxicology casework for the whole of New Zealand. We investigated the post-mortem cases received during 2020 and 2021 for eutylone and investigated trends. In addition to the post-mortem forensic toxicology cases, ESR analysed 656 drug samples from three music festivals held between December 2020 and February 2021 for the presence of drugs including eutylone. Results The post-mortem blood samples were analysed using liquid chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) for eutylone. Eutylone was detected in three cases during 2020 and in twelve (12) cases during 2021. Of the 12 cases from 2021, ten decedents were male, nine cases had a known cause of death (e.g. hanging), two cases were at or just after a music festival and two cases appeared to be drug overdoses where multiple drugs were involved. Eutylone was the only drug detected in three of the cases (all with a known cause of death). When other drugs were involved the most common were methamphetamine (n=4), MDMA (n=3), alcohol (n=3) and cannabis (n=3). For the 656 samples analysed from the three music festivals MDMA and eutylone were detected in 33% and 32% of the samples, respectively. This can be contrasted with a previous survey from December 2018 to March 2019 that found MDMA in 64% of samples and eutylone detected in less than 1% of the samples. If a mixture was present in a sample, it was common for it to contain both eutylone and MDMA. Conclusion There was a significant increase in eutylone detections both in blood samples from post-mortem forensic toxicology casework and in seized drug samples over the time period studied, with associated increases in the harm, including deaths, associated with the drug use. It has been postulated that this trend was influenced by factors such as the limited supply of MDMA in New Zealand due to law enforcement activity including a large MDMA seizure prior to the survey period for the music festivals, COVID-19 restrictions and the use of eutylone as an adulterant or replacement drug.","Russell, Sarah, Kappatos, Diana, McCarthy, Mary-Jane, Philip, Liam, Johnson, Cameron","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxac.2022.06.278","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Toxicologie Analytique et Clinique; 34(3, Supplement):S162-S163, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36468,""
"Temporal monitoring of pharmaceutical consumption using a wastewater-based epidemiologic approach","Aim Temporal monitoring of antidepressants, opioids consumption through influent wastewater, before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Leuven, Belgium. Introduction: Conventional epidemiologic data sources on pharmaceutical consumption include surveys, prescription, sales, and dispensing data. However, prescribed medication may not always be dispensed, and surveys are affected by bias (e.g., response, reporting). Furthermore, data on pharmaceutical dispensing in Belgium only covers public pharmacies, and only records reimbursed medication (e.g., over-the-counter medication, some opioids are unrecorded). In addition, patients may not take the dispensed drugs as prescribed, or incorrectly. There is also a long lag time such as three years for survey data, and over three months for dispensing data. Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) centres on the analysis of biomarkers, i.e., human metabolic excretion products of xenobiotics in influent wastewater. WBE complements existing drug utilisation approaches and provides valuable, objective, spatio-temporal information on the consumption of pharmaceuticals in the general population that may not be measured in other datasets. Method WBE was applied to 24-h composite influent wastewater samples from Leuven, Belgium. Daily samples were analysed from Sept 2019 to Dec 2019 (n=63), and on each Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday of the week from Jan 2020 to Dec 2021 (n=165). The sampled period also included several governmental restrictions (e.g., stay at home measures) to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Sample preparation and analysis consisted of preconcentration with solid-phase extraction and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. Measured concentrations (ng/L) of 21 pharmaceutical biomarkers, i.e., parent compounds and metabolites, were converted to population normalised mass loads (PNML) by considering the flow rate and catchment population. To better capture population movements, mobile phone data was used in the back-calculations. Results Concentrations of bupropion, hydromorphone, melitracen, noroxycodone, oxycodone, and tilidine were negligible or below limit of quantification and therefore excluded from further analysis. The pharmaceuticals, amitriptyline, hydroxy-bupropion, N-desmethylcitalopram, citalopram, N-desmethyl-mirtazapine, mirtazapine, trazodone, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, codeine, 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine, methadone, morphine, nortilidine, O-desmethyltramadol, and tramadol were detected and included in the temporal assessment. The PNML of most psychoactive pharmaceuticals remained stable throughout the entire sampling period. Highest median PNML levels by pharmaceutical class, respectively opioid and antidepressant, were obtained for tramadol (median 508mg/day/1000 people) and O-desmethylvenlafaxine (median 392mg/day/1000 people). Governmental measures appear to have minimal effect on the consumption. Several studies have described the psychological distress (e.g., anxiety, stress) of these measures on mental health (COVID-19 Impact, Sciensano;Mental Health Considerations during COVID-19, WHO). However, there is a long lag time between onset of mental distress, help seeking, and the actual start of pharmaceutical therapy. The sampled period may need to be extended to detect this. It remains important to monitor psychoactive pharmaceuticals with addiction potential (e.g., opioids), as they have led to health crisis in other countries. Throughout the sampled period, a small difference in week/weekend PNML is observed for all analysed pharmaceuticals. Antidepressants and opioids are indicated to be used consistently, and long-term in case of antidepressants. We hypothesize that this change may be explained due to a change in population demographics. Leuven has a large commuting student population, approx. 45% of census population, although it should be noted that the catchment area also encompasses nearby areas. Conclusion This study shows the potential of WBE to monitor consumption trends of pharmaceuticals with high temporal resolution, may not be captured by other data sources. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that care should be taken when interpreting WBE results in case of large population disruption, such as a large commuting population or COVID-19 governmental measures.","Quireyns, Maarten, Boogaerts, Tim, Van Wichelen, Natan, Pussig, Bram, De Loof, Hans, Covaci, Adrian, Van Nuijs, Alexander","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.toxac.2022.06.099","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Toxicologie Analytique et Clinique; 34(3, Supplement):S72, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36469,""
"Neuropsychiatric symptomatology in post-COVID syndrome Intervention proposal and referral from primary care","SARS-CoV-2 infection is a multiorgan disease with a wide spectrum of clinical mani-festations, including neurological and psychiatric, which are expressed in all stages of the disease and often has long-term symptoms, called post-COVID syndrome.

"Pros and cons factors influence population attitudes towards non-pharmaceutical interventions and vaccination during post-COVID-19","Objectives Population compliance greatly influences the effectiveness of vaccination and nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) for the curtaining of COVID-19 transmission. We aimed to determine the conceptual framework of potential factors that influence compliance. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Questionnaires were used to survey population attitudes towards vaccination and NPIs in China. Confirmatory factor analysis of the survey data by structural equation model (SEM) was used to define the pros and cons factors of attitudes. The strength and direction of each factorâ€™s effect on population attitudes were illustrated by Bayesian network analysis. Results 1700 respondents aged 18â€“70 years were surveyed with a panel of 34 questionnaires. Of these questionnaires, the confirmatory factor and SEM analysis identified five categories contributing to positive attitudes, including response efficiency, willingness and behavior, trust, cues to action, and knowledge, as well as four categories contributing to negative attitudes, including autonomy, perceived barriers, threat, and mental status. Bayesian networks revealed that cues to action produced a driving force for positive attitudes, followed by willingness and behavior, trust, response efficiency, and knowledge, while perceived barriers produced a driving force for negative attitudes, followed by autonomy and threat. Conclusions This study established a concise and representative list of questionnaires that could be applied to investigate the conceptual framework of potential pros and cons factors of attitudes towards vaccination and NPIs for COVID-19 prevention. The factors with driving forces should be addressed with a priority to effectively improve population compliance.","Song, Qifa, Mi, Yuwei, Ruan, Liemin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.puhe.2022.07.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Public Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36472,""
"Clinical learning during the pandemic: Experiences of LPN-BN undergraduate nursing students","Background When the COVID-19 pandemic was declared in March 2020, nursing programs made rapid decisions regarding clinical placement experiences for students. In many nursing programs, this meant ending clinical placements early, delaying clinical courses, and moving clinical courses to simulation. Purpose The purpose of this study was to explore LPN-BN students' experiences in clinical courses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A qualitative descriptive approach was employed in this study. Fifteen semi-structured conversational interviews with nursing students and recent graduates were conducted. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results Four main concepts were identified: (1) logistics of learning;(2) shifts in clinical learning;(3) mental health matters;(4) readiness to practice. Conclusion It is important to understand the experience of nursing students as this is an inordinately stressful and impressionable time for them. Insight into the student experience, will inform educators in the areas of curriculum and competency-based evaluation as well as supports for student mental health and well-being.","Bryan, Venise, Corcoran, Lynn, Dewart, Georgia, Thirsk, Lorraine M.; Bowers, Erin","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.profnurs.2022.07.020","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Professional Nursing; 42:301-307, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36473,""
"Produce Prescription Projects: Challenges, Solutions, and Emerging Best Practices - Perspectives from Health Care Providers","Produce prescription projects are becoming increasingly common. This study explores perspectives and experiences of a sample of health care providers throughout the United States participating in implementing produce prescription projects with funding from the United States Department of Agriculture. Surveys (N=34) were administered to collect demographic and descriptive data. Subsequently, individual key-informant interviews with participating health care providers (N=16) were conducted via videoconference. Participants in this study included physicians and clinical staff (e.g., nursing, nutrition, social work) who work at health care organizations that facilitate a produce prescription project. Interview transcripts were coded using thematic qualitative analysis methods. Four cross-cutting key themes emerged. First, interviewees shared operational challenges, including lack of time/staff, difficulty with provider/patient engagement (some related to COVID-19), steep â€œtrial and errorâ€ learning curve, and formidable barriers related to data sharing and research-related requirements (e.g., Institutional Review Board approvals). Second, interviewees elucidated their solutions, lessons learned, and emerging best practices as a response to challenges (e.g., importance of having a full-time paid staff member to manage PPR within clinic). Third, interviewees expressed satisfaction with produce prescription projects, particularly related to positive patient experiences (e.g., improved clinical outcomes and improved food security). Fourth, interviewees also shared appreciation for rigorous program evaluation to establish sustained funding and advance policies. However, they contextualized this appreciation within challenges outlined regarding collecting and sharing patient-related data outcomes. Findings provide emergent best practices and inform additional resources that are needed to sustainably implement and rigorously evaluate produce prescription projects.","Stotz, Sarah A.; Budd Nugent, Nadine, Ridberg, Ronit, Byker-Shanks, Carmen, Her, Ka, Yaroch, Amy L.; Seligman, Hilary","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2022.101951","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Preventive Medicine Reports;: 101951, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36474,""
"Prospering in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: The effects of PROSPER-based intervention on psychological outcomes among preschool teachers","The growing concerns regarding the risks of transmitting the COVID-19 virus has intensified the job-related stressors commonly encountered by teachers in various cultural contexts. Evidence shows how the COVID-19 crisis has negatively impacted teachers' mental health outcomes such as stress, depression, and quality of life, which highlights the significance of designing psychological programs to boost teachers' well-being. This study examined the effects of a well-being intervention based on the Positivity, Relationship, Outcomes, Strength, Purpose, Engagement, and Resilience (PROSPER) framework on well-being outcomes among 76 in-service teachers (MageÂ =Â 26.05Â years, SDÂ =Â 4.71, rangeÂ =Â 20â€“45;femaleÂ =Â 93.4%) in Hong Kong. Participants completed survey measures associated with the seven PROSPER outcomes at baseline and 2-month follow-up. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that there were statistically significant multivariate effects for intervention conditions, Wilks' Lambda F(7, 58)Â =Â 4.50, pÂ =Â .01. Results demonstrated that teachers who were assigned to the intervention condition (nÂ =Â 36) had significantly higher scores than those in the control condition (nÂ =Â 40) on positivity (bÂ =Â 0.41, 95% CI [0.16, 0.65], pÂ =Â .01), strength (bÂ =Â 0.62, 95% CI [0.23, 1.01], pÂ =Â .01), purpose (bÂ =Â 0.61, 95% CI [0.18, 1.04], pÂ =Â .01), and resilience (bÂ =Â 0.57, 95% CI [0.07, 1.07], pÂ =Â .04).

"This was my Crimean War: COVID-19 Experiences of Nursing Home Leaders","Objective To describe professional and personal experiences of nursing home care leaders during early waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design Qualitative interpretive description. Setting and Participants Eight sites across 2 Canadian provinces. Sites varied by COVID-19 status (low/medium/high), size (under or over 120 beds) and ownership model (for-profit/not-for-profit). We recruited 21 leaders as participants: 14 managers and 7 directors of care. Methods Remote Zoom-assisted semi-structured interviews conducted from January to April 2021. Concurrent data generation and inductive content analysis occurred throughout. Sampling ceased once we reached sufficient analytic variation and richness to answer research questions. Results Most participants were female, over 50 years of age and born in Canada. We found 4 major themes. 1) Responsibility to protect: Extreme precautions were employed to protect residents, staff and leadersâ€™ families. Leaders experienced profound distress when COVID-19 infiltrated their care homes. 2) Overwhelming workloads: Changing public health orders and redeployment to pandemic-related activities caused administrative chaos. Leaders worked double shifts to cope with pandemic demands and maintain their usual work. 3) Mental and emotional toll: All participants reported symptoms of anxiety, depression and insomnia, leading to ongoing exhaustion. Shifting staff focus from caring to custodial enforcement of isolation caused considerable distress, guilt and grief. 4) Moving forward: The pandemic spotlighted deficiencies in the nursing home context that lead to inadequate quality of resident care and staff burnout. Some leaders indicated their pandemic experience signaled an unanticipated end to their careers. Conclusions and Implications Nursing home leaders faced mental distress and inordinate workloads during the pandemic. This is an urgent call for systemic change to improve working conditions for leaders and quality of care and quality of life for residents. Nursing home leaders are at increased risk of burnout, which must be addressed to mitigate attrition in the sector.","Savage, Amber, Young, Sandra, Titley, Heather K.; Thorne, Trina E.; Spiers, Jude, Estabrooks, Carole A.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2022.08.001","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Medical Directors Association;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36476,""
"Mental health in medical, dental and pharmacy students: a cross-sectional study","Background The mental health of health students is considered a public health issue which increased dramatically with the COVID 19â€™s pandemic. Few studies have assessed the prevalence of depression in medical, pharmacy, and dental students. Our goal was to assess mental health in health students from the same university and identify the associated factors. Methods An online survey was sent to the health students of the University of Paris in 3 specialties (medicine, pharmacy, and dentistry). We used the Hospitalization Anxiety and Depression scale, the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Short Form and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (with 2 versions: the Human Services Survey for clinical students and residents and the Student survey for the others). The presence of suicidal ideation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and sexual aggression over twelve-months was also measured. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to identify the associated factors of Major Depressive Episodes (MDE). Findings 1925 students answered the survey. The overall prevalence of 7-day anxiety and depressive symptoms, MDE, suicidal ideation, humiliation, sexual harassment, and sexual aggression were 55%, 23%, 26%, 19%, 19%, 22%, and 5.5%, respectively. Burnout was present in 49% of nonclinical students and 67% of clinical students and residents. Multivariable logistic regression identified several associated factors of MDE: moderate (OR=1.49,CI95[1.17-1.90]) or major (OR=2.32,CI95[1.68-3.20]) subjective financial difficulties, humiliation (OR=1.71,CI95[1.28-2.28]), sexual abuse (OR=1.65,CI95[1.04-2.60]), and sexual harassment (OR=1.60,CI95[1.19-2.16]).

"Contextual Influence of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pregnant Womenâ€™s Emotional Regulation Abilities","Introduction: Emotional regulation is a key factor that could determine the quality of becoming a parent. Since pregnancy is accompanied by changes in the emotional system, fluctuations in emotional regulation may also occur during this period. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had major psychological repercussions on the general population which could have also affected emotional regulation capacities. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine whether emotional regulation has characteristics during pregnancy and to evaluate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emotional regulation of pregnant women. Method: One hundred fifty-one women aged between 19 and 42 years old participated in this study. Their emotional regulation abilities were assessed using the Difficulties Emotion Regulation Scale before and during the pandemic. A two-factor multivariate analysis of covariance, ""parental status"" (pregnant vs. childless) and ""time of data collection"" (before vs. during COVID-19), was conducted to compare the emotional regulation abilities of pregnant women with those of childless women before and during the pandemic. Results: (1) Prior to the pandemic, pregnant women exhibited better emotional regulation skills than childless women, characterized by greater acceptance and understanding of their emotions. (2) During the pandemic: (a) pregnant womenâ€™s emotional regulation scores were comparable to those of women without children. (b) They also had more difficulty than pre-pandemic pregnant women in identifying their emotions. Conclusion: The lack of improvement in emotional regulation skills in pregnant women during the COVID-19 pandemic is a specific impact of COVID on this population. This could affect their mental health, as well as the emotional adjustment of the mother towards her baby.

Une analyse de la covariance multivariÃ©e Ã  deux facteurs, Â« statut parental Â» (enceinte vs sans enfant) et Â« pÃ©riode de recueil des donnÃ©es Â» (avant vs pendant la COVID-19) a Ã©tÃ© menÃ©e, afin de comparer les capacitÃ©s des femmes enceintes Ã  celles de femmes sans enfant, avant et pendant la pandÃ©mie. RÃ©sultats: (1) Avant la pandÃ©mie, les femmes enceintes prÃ©sentaient de meilleures capacitÃ©s de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle que les femmes sans enfant, caractÃ©risÃ©es par une meilleure acceptation et comprÃ©hension de leurs Ã©motions. (2) Pendant la pandÃ©mie : les femmes enceintes (a) ont perdu cet avantage ;leurs scores de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle Ã©taient comparables Ã  ceux des femmes sans enfant. (b) Elles prÃ©sentaient Ã©galement plus de difficultÃ©s que les femmes enceintes rencontrÃ©es avant la pandÃ©mie pour identifier leurs Ã©motions. Conclusion: Lâ€™absence dâ€™amÃ©lioration des capacitÃ©s de rÃ©gulation Ã©motionnelle chez les femmes enceintes pendant la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19 constitue un retentissement spÃ©cifique de la COVID sur cette population. Celle-ci pourrait retentir sur leur santÃ© mentale mais aussi sur lâ€™ajustement Ã©motionnel de la mÃ¨re Ã  son bÃ©bÃ©.","Toleon, Camille, Deborde, Anne-Sophie, Ahmad, Sam, Vanwalleghem, StÃ©phanie","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2022.05.010","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: L'EncÃ©phale;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36478,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on the Characteristics of Opioid Overdose Deaths in Arkansas","Background In the US, spikes in drug overdose deaths overlapping with the COVID-19 pandemic create concern that persons who use drugs are especially vulnerable. This study aimed to compare the trends in opioid overdose deaths and characterize opioid overdose deaths by drug subtype and person characteristics pre-COVID (2017-2019) and one-year post-COVID-19 emergence (2020). Methods We obtained death certificates on drug overdose deaths in Arkansas from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2020. Our analyses consisted of an interrupted time-series and segmented regression analysis to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the number of opioid overdose deaths. Results The proportion of opioid overdose deaths increased by 36% post-COVID emergence (95% CI: 14%, 59%). The trend in overdose deaths involving synthetic narcotics other than methadone, such as fentanyl and tramadol, has increased since 2018 (74 in 2018 vs 79 in 2019;p=0.02 and 79 in 2019 versus 158 in 2020;p=0.03). Opioid overdose deaths involving methamphetamine have more than doubled (36 in 2019 vs 82 in 2020;pÂ =Â 0.06) despite remaining steady from 2018 to 2019. Synthetic narcotics have surpassed methamphetamine (71% vs. 37%) as the leading cause of opioid overdose deaths in Arkansas during the pandemic. This study found that synthetic narcotics are the significant drivers of the increase in opioid overdose deaths in Arkansas during the pandemic. Conclusions The co-occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the drug abuse epidemic further highlights the increased need for expanding awareness and availability of resources for treating substance use disorders.","Rezaeiahari, Mandana, Fairman, Brian J.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103836","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Drug Policy;: 103836, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36479,""
"Anxiety is more related to inadequate eating habits in inactive than in physically active adults during COVID-19 quarantine","Background & Aims Anxiety can be related to reduced diet quality during pandemics such as COVID-19. However, it is not clear whether these relationships would be similar in inactive and physically active participants. The aim of this study was to analyze associations between anxiety and eating habits in physically active and inactive individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The sample consisted of 1826 adults (58.5% women) who were invited through social media to answer an online questionnaire. The instrument included questions related to physical activity, eating habits, health behavior, mental health (anxiety, depression, self-esteem, sadness and stress) and overall health. Anxiety, food habits (high food habits consumption =5 times per week) and physical activity (=150 minutes per week) were assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between anxiety and eating habits according to levels of physical activity (inactive vs. active) was assessed using binary logistic regression adjusted for sex, age, education level, social isolation, and body mass index. Results Among the inactive participants, anxiety was related with high consumption of sweets (OR= 1.43;95% CI= 1.11-1.83) and fast foods (OR= 2.23;95% CI= 1.05-4.74) while quarantining during the COVID-19 pandemic. No relationship was observed between anxiety and food consumption among physically active participants in the final model. Conclusion Anxiety was associated with less desirable eating habits among physically inactive adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Christofaro, Diego G. D.; Tebar, William R.; Silva, Gabriela C.

"Psychiatry: From its historical and philosophical roots to the modern face","This book was the end product of life experiences, thoughts and intellectual wanderings of the author, who through his career and for the last twenty years was always serving all the three aspects of a Psychiatrist: He is a clinician, a researcher and an academic teacher. The book includes a comprehensive history of Psychiatry since antiquity and until today, with an emphasis not only on main events but also specifically and with much detail and explanations, on the chain of events that led to a particular development. At the center of this work is the question 'What is mental illness?' and 'Does free will exist?'. These are questions which tantalize Psychiatrists, neuroscientists, psychologists, philosophers, patients and their families and the sensitive and educated lay persons alike. Thus, the book includes a comprehensive review and systematic elaboration on the definition and the concept of mental illness, a detailed discussion on the issue of free will as well as the state of the art of contemporary Psychiatry and the socio-political currents it has provoked. Finally the book includes a description of the academic, social and professional status of Psychiatry and Psychiatrists and a view of future needs and possible developments. A last moment addition was the chapter on conspiracy theories, as a consequence of the experience with the social media and the public response to the COVID-19 outbreak which coincided with the final stage of the preparation of the book. Their study is an excellent opportunity to dig deep into the relation among human psychology, mental health, the society and politics and to swim in intellectually dangerous waters.

"College psychiatry: Strategies to improve access to mental health","This book explores the practical strategies outlined by national thought leaders to improve access to mental health care in the practice of college psychiatry. It addresses the escalating need for mental health services on college and university campuses. Concise yet comprehensive, the book considers the college experience for the increasingly diverse student body, including non-traditional college students, first-generation college students, and students with a history of mental illness. Beginning with a discussion on the current national health trends in college mental health, chapter one explores the current epidemiology of student mental health problems, the systemic challenges in recruitment, and funding psychiatric services. Subsequent chapters then delve into the various systems and models of psychiatric care for college students, including differing parental involvement levels and the importance of collaborative care to short term management and referral of students at risk. Chapters five and six examine mental health considerations for LGBTQ, Black, Indigenous, and People of Color students. Further chapters analyze the critical nature of successfully navigating a leave of absence, as well as the consideration of threat assessment on college campuses. The book closes with a highly relevant evaluation of telemental health and telepsychiatry in the College Setting as it pertains to the ongoing barriers to care caused by COVID-19.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of patients with suicide and suicide attempts who were transferred to our hospital during the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic period (January to December 2020) and a similar nonâ€“COVIDâ€“19 pandemic period (January 2018 to December 2019). We also investigated the age and monthly number of patients with suicide and suicide attempts during the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic period and compared them with the number of patients with COVIDâ€“19. Results: In 2020, 39% of patients attempting suicide were in their 20s or younger, an increase in the proportion of younger patients compared to 27% in the nonâ€“COVIDâ€“19 pandemic period. During the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic period, the monthly number of suicide attempts showed an inverse variation with the increase or decrease in the number of COVIDâ€“19 patients. The same trend was also observed for patients committing suicide. Conclusion: The number of suicide attempts among young people increased during the COVIDâ€“19 pandemic and the number of suicide attempts seemed to be affected with the number of COVIDâ€“19 patients.

"Creative adolescent experiences of education and mental health during COVID-19: A qualitative study","This qualitative study investigated creative adolescent perceptions of their educational and mental health experiences during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Participants were 25 English-speaking adolescents from the Midwest in the United States. They were identified as creative by their teachers according to known creative profiles. Participants attended an all-day creative career workshop in the Spring 2021 semester. The five focus groups guided by semi-structured interviews conducted for this study occurred during the workshop. This study was phenomenological in nature with constructivist and transformative paradigms, and transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis by the first, second, and third authors. Creative adolescents' education during the pandemic was marked by classroom changes based on COVID-19 policies, experiences of disconnection, disengagement, and disappointment, as well as feelings of empathy and appreciation for their educators. Creative adolescents experienced mental health challenges related to adjustment issues, powerlessness and hopelessness, and isolation. Implications of results are discussed.

"Psychological responses and behaviors during the initial stages of COVID-19 among general Us population","Background: The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, has posed a major public health risk across the world. The threat of the virus and the resulting quarantine or ""stay-home-orders,"" likely impacted physical and mental health across the US population. The purpose of this study was to examine the psychological responses and behaviors during the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in a US sample, applying the Common-Sense Model of illness to encourage a more comprehensive conceptualization of psychological and behavioral response to COVID-19.Methods: This study used Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk), a widely used data-sourcing tool, to assess the psychological impact of COVID-19 and quarantine for a large sample (N = 584) of US citizens, applying the Common-Sense Model of Illness as a way of predicting cognitive and emotional representations of the virus, engagement in precautionary and self-care behaviors, and appraisals of control. Conclusions: These results suggested that US citizens felt knowledgeable about COVID-19 and confident in precautionary behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19. However, while most US citizens reported normative levels of emotional distress in response to COVID-19, about 19-30% reported scores that indicated moderate to severe distress. Greater distress predicted decreased engagement in self-care behaviors and certain precautionary behaviors. People who engaged in both precautionary and self-care behaviors felt that they were helpful. While the results of this study are preliminary and further study is needed, these results suggest that Leventhal's Common-Sense Model of Illness may be applicable to understanding the US citizen experience of COVID-19.

"Deconditioning: causes and effects and impact on patient wellbeing","Deconditioning is a term used to describe the physical decline a person might experience following a period of inactivity. It has long been recognised, but has previously been associated with prolonged periods of immobility or hospitalisation resulting from injury or illness. As we come out of the Covid-19 pandemic and the associated periods of lockdown and shielding the more vulnerable, there is evidence that some of the population are suffering the effects of deconditioning. It is apparent that this may be with or without coexisting medical conditions and needs to be considered as an additional or stand-alone diagnosis where symptoms exist, or where worsening of an underlying medical condition could be as a result of deconditioning.

"Psychological and professional repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic in female faculty with children: An investigation of outcomes across different academic career stages","Identified factors that put women at increased risk of leaving academic careers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. 153 women faculty members (aged 29-57) working in the American tenure system completed demographic measures, as well as measures of work and household responsibilities;satisfaction with personal and professional activities;satisfaction with life;quality of life;and depression, anxiety, and stress. Findings point to few differences between women pre- and post-tenure in the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on time spent on various professional and personal pursuits. However, all women reported an increase in the proportion of chores they are responsible for at home during the pandemic, and a decrease in time spent on research due to competing demands at home and at work, including the burden of shifting to online teaching. Women pre- and post-tenure differed significantly in the extent to which these changes appear to impact their reported satisfaction with life and with their relationships with their partners and children. To the extent that the negative psychological effects of heightened work-family conflict increase the likelihood that women drop out of academic careers, these findings highlight the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic could have long-lasting adverse repercussions for the retention and representation of women in academia.

"Cigarettes' use and capabilities-opportunities-motivation-for-behavior model: a multi-country survey of adolescents and young adults","The use of cigarettes among adolescents and young adults (AYA) is an important issue. This study assessed the association between regular and electronic-cigarettes use among AYA and factors of the Capability-Motivation-Opportunity-for-Behavior-change (COM-B) model. A multi-country survey was conducted between August-2020 and January-2021, Data was collected using the Global-Youth-Tobacco-Survey and Generalized-Anxiety-Disorder-7-item-scale. Multi-level logistic-regression-models were used. Use of regular and electronic-cigarettes were dependent variables. The explanatory variables were capability-factors (COVID-19 status, general anxiety), motivation-factors (attitude score) and opportunity-factors (country-level affordability scores, tobacco promotion-bans, and smoke free-zones) controlling for age and sex. Responses of 6,989-participants from 25-countries were used. Those who reported that they were infected with COVID-19 had significantly higher odds of electronic-cigarettes use (AOR = 1.81, P = 0.02). Normal or mild levels of general anxiety and negative attitudes toward smoking were associated with significantly lower odds of using regular-cigarettes (AOR = 0.34, 0.52, and 0.75, P &lt; 0.001) and electronic-cigarettes (AOR = 0.28, 0.45, and 0.78, P &lt; 0.001). Higher affordability-score was associated with lower odds of using electronic-cigarettes (AOR = 0.90, P = 0.004).

"COVID-19 and Children","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for more than 500 million cases worldwide as of April 2022. Initial estimates in 2020 found children were less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to be asymptomatic or display mild COVID-19 symptoms. Our early understanding of COVID-19 transmission and disease in children led to a range of public health measures including school closures that have indirectly impacted child health and wellbeing. The emergence of variants of concern (particularly delta and omicron) have raised new issues about transmissibility in children, as preliminary data suggests children may be at increased risk of infection especially if unvaccinated. Global national prevalence data shows SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents is rising due to COVID-19 vaccination among adults and increased circulation of delta and omicron variants. To mitigate this, childhood immunisation programs are being implemented globally to prevent direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 including severe complications (e.g. MIS-C), debilitating long-COVID symptoms, and the indirect impacts of prolonged community and school closures on childhood education, social and behavioural development and mental health. This talk will provide an overview of the current state-of-knowledge on COVID19 in children, including COVID-19 vaccination strategies, with using some examples of research findings from MCRI, Melbourne.","Licciardi, Paul V.","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+and+Children","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Asia-Pacific Journal of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology; 30:8, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36494,""
"Favorable outcome of geriatric telemedicine for frail older adults with COVID-19 staying at home during the omicron tsunami in Hong Kong","Hong Kong was hit by a tsunami of COVID-19 in mid-February 2022, impacting on frail older adults with high COVID-19 mortality. Two older adults with COVID-19 managed by geriatric telemedicine at home were reported with favorable outcome despite severe frailty (Clinical Frailty Score 7). Stressed by COVID-19, both presented with the geriatric giants or frailty syndromes of brain failure (delirium) and balance failure (falls). Their successful outcome resulted not from COVID-19 antiviral treatment, but individualized holistic person-centered care attending to the frailty syndromes: optimized treatment of comorbid conditions by medication review, medication reduction on recognition of drug-induced hypotension and hypoglycaemia, appropriate use of medication to reduce iatrogenesis, caregivers' replenishment of fluid and nutrition deficit, oxygen support during critical hypoxic period, and recognition and early treatment of superimposed infections (bacterial respiratory tract superinfection, herpes zoster). Their social support was good. Family members and helpers became invaluable resources in providing the much-needed personal care, nutrition, hydration, comfort, and health monitoring to keep the geriatrician informed of their condition and to draw up an individualized management plan. Home environment and human presence were therapeutic in delirium care, avoiding damage from separation and isolation commonly practiced in this COVID-19 pandemic. Two older COVID-19 patients were successfully managed at home by geriatric telemedicine despite severe frailty. The frailty imbalance triggered by COVID-19 leading to delirium and falls was restored by reducing harmful drugs;optimizing physical and mental health by correcting hypoxia, hypotension, and hypoglycemia;enhanced social support improving hydration, nutrition, human presence;identifying/ treating superinfections (bacterial respiratory tract superinfection, herpes zoster).","Kong, Tak-kwan","https://www.google.com/search?q=Favorable+outcome+of+geriatric+telemedicine+for+frail+older+adults+with+COVID-19+staying+at+home+during+the+omicron+tsunami+in+Hong+Kong","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Aging medicine (Milton (N.S.W));2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36495,""

"CLINICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION IN BURNING-MOUTH SYNDROME PATIENTS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY","Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a chronic disease characterized by the presence of persistent oral mucosa pain, mainly burning sensation without any detectable clinical cause or modified general investigations. Coronavims infections, in some patients, caused sensations of oral burning, of a neuropathic nature, which mimicked the symptoms of BMS. In addition, the psychiatric manifestations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have exacerbated the symptoms of patients already diagnosed with burning mouth syndrome. Based on these observations, we conducted a longitudinal study to assess the changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms in BMS patients during the pandemics. We recruited two groups of age and gender-matched BMS patients. The first group included patients with BMS diagnosed with coronavirus infection and the second one without coronavims infection. The study concluded that in patients with coronavims infection there was an intensification of anxiety-depressive symptoms more pronounced in the first 6 months after infection (duration being associated with the infection severity and long-COVID symptoms), followed by a recurrence or even decrease in symptoms compared to the initial examination Oral symptomatology had a similar evolution, the intensity being determined by the severity of the COVID-19 infection episode and by the prolonged use of antivirals. The lack of a larger number of studies and patients with BMS and COVID-19 infection limited the possibility of comparative analyses.","Dugan, C.; Popescu, B.

"Indoor air quality, largely neglected and in urgent need of a refresh","While outdoor air quality is managed under the Resource Management Act 1991, which sets National Environmental Standards for outdoor air, no equivalent legislation exists for indoor air quality. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises that healthy indoor air is a basic human right, stating that the quality of the air people breathe in buildings is an important determinant of health and wellbeing.3 According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States (US), indoor air pollutant levels are typically two-to-five times higher than outdoor levels, and in some cases exceed outdoor levels of the same pollutants by a 100 times.4 Globally around 2.6 billion people still use solid fuels and kerosene for cooking, and the United Nations notes that indoor and ambient air pollution are the greatest environmental health risk.3 Time spent indoors combined with higher indoor concentrations of pollutants make the health risks associated with poor air quality usually greater indoors than outdoors. While initial public health efforts focused on measures to reduce fomite transmission, such as hand-washing, it is now well-recognised that airborne exposure is the predominant transmission route of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).6 International consensus on airborne transmission was achieved in part through cutting-edge research conducted by New Zealand experts, but New Zealand health authorities have been slow to apply this key insight beyond border settings.7 It is imperative that national bodies responsible for the control of the pandemic incorporate the importance of airborne transmission to inform an evidence-based strategy and implement a range of highly effective measures that can prevent airborne transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and other respiratory pathogens, including influenza.8-9'1011 The most effective approach to lowering concentrations of indoor air pollutants, including any pathogens that may be in the air, is usually to increase ventilation,12 exchanging polluted indoor air for cleaner outdoor air. Pollutant standards for heating and cooking appliances, particularly for appliances that use unflued gas should also be considered.20 An investment in clean indoor air could bring benefits other than reducing COVID-19 transmission, including reduced sick leave and school absenteeism caused by other respiratory infections, particularly influenza and other allergies.21 Less absenteeism-with associated adverse effect on productivity-could save companies significant costs.22 Furthermore, there is growing evidence that improved ventilation can improve cognitive functioning of workers and students,23 which can improve both wellbeing, sleep and productivity.24 Ventilation can also reduce indoor moisture particularly in homes, which wifi reduce exposure to respiratory allergens and irritants such as dust mites and mould, resulting in reduced incidence of asthma, rhinitis and allergy symptoms.","Bennett, Julie, Shorter, Caroline, Kvalsvig, Amanda, Barnard, Lucy Telfar, Wilson, Nick, Crane, Julian, Douwes, Jeroen, Cunningham, Chris, Taptiklis, Phoebe, Phipps, Robyn, Trompetter, Bill, Plagmann, Manfred, Boulic, Mikael, Summers, Jennifer, Berry, Terri-Ann, Baker, Michael G.; Howden-Chapman, Philippa","https://www.google.com/search?q=Indoor+air+quality,+largely+neglected+and+in+urgent+need+of+a+refresh","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: The New Zealand Medical Journal (Online); 135(1559):136-139, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36500,""

Emotion regulation and social support could be major protective factors against such psychopathological states, but their role has not been explored outside Western contexts. Objective: To assess the association between emotion regulation, social support, acute stress disorder, and depression among healthcare workers directly confronted with the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Method: A cross-sectional study assessed acute stress disorder, depression, adaptive (i.e. acceptance, positive refocusing, â€¦) and maladaptive (i.e. self-blame, rumination, catastrophizing, â€¦) emotion regulation strategies, social support (instrumental, emotional, and informational levels), as well as self-reported situations and feelings related to COVID-19, in a population of 252 frontline healthcare workers (121 women;131 men;mean age: 39 Â± 11 years old) at the Referral General Hospital of Bukavu. We also explored the relations between these variables through bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Forty percent of participants presented symptoms of depression, and 16% presented acute stress disorder. In bivariate logistic regression, these psychiatric outcomes were associated with the availability of a COVID-19 protection kit [OR = 0.24 (0.12â€“0.98)], hostility toward health workers [OR = 3.21 (1.23â€“4.21)], putting into perspective [OR = 0.91 (0.43â€“0.98)], self-blame [OR = 1.44 (1.11â€“2.39)], catastrophizing [OR = 1.85 (1.01â€“4.28)], blaming others [OR = 1.77 (1.04â€“3.32)], emotional support [OR = 0.83 (0.49â€“0.98)], instrumental support [OR = 0.74 (0.28â€“0.94)], and informational support [OR = 0.73 (0.43â€“0.98)]. In multivariate logistic regression, hostility [OR = 2.21 (1.54â€“3.78)], self-blame [OR = 1.57 (1.02-2.11)], rumination [OR = 1.49 (1.11-3.13)] and emotional support [OR = 0.94 (0.65-0.98)] remained significantly associated with psychiatric outcomes. Conclusion: Depression and acute stress disorder were highly prevalent among Congolese healthcare workers during the first wave of the COVID-19 health pandemic. Hostility, self-blame, rumination, and social support were associated with depression and/or acute stress disorder and should be targeted by interventions aiming to support health workersâ€™ wellbeing. HIGHLIGHTS Frontline health workers presented high prevalence of acute stress disorder (16%) and depression (40%) during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, as they were working in hostile environment without enough protection kits. Acute stress disorder and depression were negatively associated with adaptive emotion regulation and social support;and positively with maladaptive emotion regulation.

Furthermore, the study found that Sindhi individuals had significantly higher scores as compared to other ethnic groups (p=0.002). Conclusion: The young population is as equally stressed as adults and may suffer from substantial anxiety during the pandemic. Therefore, parents should be encouraged to create an atmosphere of support and goodwill.","Dars, J. A.; Iqbal, N.; Khoso, Z.

"The Vulnerability of the Human Being, Society, Nature, and God","In this paper, the author reflects on the meaning of vulnerability in the moral sphere. He understands vulnerability in a broader, ontological sense, which means that every human being is vulnerable because everyone is fragile and imperfect. It is this state of vulnerability that opens the individual up to relating with others, connecting, to an attitude of empathy, compassion and solidarity, to finding creative solutions. At the societal level, we have recently experienced vulnerability in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and in facing the war in Ukraine, which, on one hand, reveals our helplessness, but on the other hand, strengthens the search for common solutions and solidarity. Drawing on Hans Jonas, the author discusses the vulnerability of nature, which is being en croached upon by human beings to such an extent that it threatens the quality of the permanent existence of humanity on our planet. The author is convinced that God is also essentially vulnerable because he is sentient and in solidarity with his people;moreover, in Jesus Christ, he becomes one of us and reveals himself to us in all his vulnerability. It is through his wounds that salvation and the possibility of new life come into the world. Faith in Jesus Christ enables us to accept our vulnerability, to be attentive to the vulnerability of other human beings and the whole creation, and to take responsibility and care of life.","Globokar, R.","https://doi.org/10.34291/BV2022/01/Globokar","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Bogoslovni Vestnik-Theological Quarterly-Ephemerides Theologicae; 82(1):7-14, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36508,""
"Pregnancy, peripartum, and COVID-19: An updated literature review","Due to the physiological changes of the pregnancy and considering the susceptibility of the fetus, pregnant women are among the vulnerable health groups. The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has multiplied the health burden on vulnerable and susceptible groups. With over 500,000 new cases daily, the vulnerable groups are in danger more than ever. Therefore, early diagnosis, effective treatment, and efficient prevention strategies are significant among these groups. Since the clinical knowledge about the diagnosis, management, prevention, and many other aspects of pregnancy and lactation during COVID-19 has significantly changed and improved from the pandemic's beginning, most of the previous knowledge has changed, and the previous publications might not be helpful anymore. This review aims to provide an updated and comprehensive review of the mutual impact of pregnancy and COVID-19 infection, discuss the current controversies based on the most recent findings, and highlight the existing knowledge gaps. Due to the increased susceptibility, undesired outcomes are more expected among pregnant women with COVID-19 infection. Still, prevention measures are the best way of managing COVID-19 in this population. Moreover, further clinical studies should address the long-term complications, outcomes, safety of vaccination, and the impact of the pandemic on mental health.","Jahanshahlou, F.; Mahmoodpoor, A.; Sanaie, S.; Naseri, A.; Rafsanjani, M.

"EVALUATION OF THE LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTH IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS DURING THE SARS-COV2 PANDEMIC","The pandemic caused by SARS-COV2, worldwide caused a sedentary lifestyle and damage to mental health in the general population, including university students, a sector that did not escape these adverse effects due to the pandemic. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to evaluate the levels of physical activity (PA) and mental health in university students during the COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-COV2) pandemic. The DASS-21 scale, the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) and the SF-36 Health Questionnaire were applied to 63 university students from the State of Veracruz, Mexico, aged 18 to 24 years. The data treatment was carried out in the statistical software SPSS v.25, the results showed that 76.2% of the sample was found in physically active levels, likewise the correlation coefficients made between physical activity (PA) and anxiety (r= -.41) physical activity (PA) and stress (r= -.42) showed negative correlations with moderate to intense magnitudes, respectively. Therefore, it is concluded that performing physical activity during the pandemic was shown to significantly reduce problems related to mental health in university students.","Garcia, K. Y.

"The Politics of Hate Infection anxiety and defense","The article approaches the attraction of hate politics via reflections on the dilemmas and resistances that get in the way of its analysis. Sociopsychological investigation of the new political movements that seek communality by way of highly negative affects (such as the protests against measures designed to contain the Covid pandemic) is impeded by the emotional involvement displayed by researchers. Encounters with hostility and hate are invasive in their impact, jeopardize psychic integrity, and spell the demise of curiosity and empathy. Equally threatening is the normative proximity to central topoi of these movements: the idealization of criticism, resistance, and autonomy. The regressive temptations held out by hate politics may arouse feelings of envy. Defense operations are undertaken to counteract contamination, involuntary proximity, and envy. These include leaving the field, cathexis withdrawal, and the adoption of the logic of splitting and devaluation. Maneuvers of this kind are also discernible in research on the subject. Keeping one's distance means not learning anything new;letting oneself be drawn in means becoming a part of the very dynamic one is investigating. In research, this leads to a moralizing implementation of defense against anxiety and powerlessness.","Brockhaus, G.","https://doi.org/10.21706/ps-76-7-599","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psyche-Zeitschrift Fur Psychoanalyse Und Ihre Anwendungen; 76(7):599-631, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36511,""

"Psychotherapy in Dealing with Crises in the COVID-19 Pandemic","In the article, a theoretical analysis of the study of crisis states and the methodological foundations of crisis psychotherapy, taking into account foreign and domestic experience, is carried out. Based on the results of empirical studies, modern foreign and domestic researchers have established that crisis conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic are accompanied by suicidal reactions, depression, neurotic conditions with post-traumatic stress disorders, exacerbation of psychosomatic diseases, psychopathological disorders.Psychological approaches in psychotherapy together with crisis psycho-psychotherapeutic interventions for working with acute crisis states and crisis psychotherapy of clients in the post-quarantine period are considered.The concepts of a crisis state, the features of the influence of ""covid"" psychotrauma on the mental and psychological health of a person, and the provision of psychological assistance in crisis situations during the COVID-19 pandemic are described in detail. It is noted that in working with crisis conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, modern foreign and Ukrainian specialists prefer cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy.At the theoretical and methodological level, it has been proved that psychotherapy of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is close to crisis psychotherapy and is aimed at reintegration of mental activity disturbed by the ""conductive"" psychotrauma and restoration of psychological adaptation to a certain extent.The psychotherapeutic model of psychological crisis intervention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is based on a biopsychosocial approach and requires a comprehensive and integrated use of crisis psychotherapy methods with the integration of neuropsychotic methods and Internet technologies into the entire therapy process.","Bihun, N.; Tverezovska, N.; Vdovichenko, O.; Barinova, N.; Kocharian, A.; Kazanzhy, M.","https://doi.org/10.18662/brain/13.2/342","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Brain-Broad Research in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience; 13(2):259-272, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36514,""
"From Chimps to Bats: Human Social Evolution and Pandemic Potential over 15,000 Years","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, like past pandemics and those yet to come, is self-inflicted. For most of human history, our ancestors lived much like chimpanzees, in small, mobile groups and hosted few viruses as a result. With the evolution of farming, cities, and ever-improving transport networks, our more recent ancestors lived more like bats, in tightly packed clusters that encouraged the transmission, reproduction, and mutation of viruses and other potential pathogens. Unlike those of bats, human immune systems are not calibrated by some 64 million years of evolutionary adapta-tion to heavy viral loads. So our potential as hosts for global pandemics is strong.","McNeill, J.

"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on graduating dental interns: the studentsâ€™ perspective","life of the individual as well as of the society globally. Medical and healthcare education has become virtual, complex, and challenging with minimal real-time experience. Dental education has faced major impacts affecting the skills and preparedness of the graduates. This study aimed to assess the overall impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on graduating dental interns. Methods. This cross-sectional survey was conducted among the graduating dental interns from various states across India. A specially designed questionnaire was used in our study which consisted of multiple-choice, Likert scale, dichotomous response, open-ended response questions. The 15 item questionnaire focused on 5 domains (i) demographic details (ii) perceptions regarding disrupted academic schedule and switch to E-education (iii) perceptions on its impact on the career (iv) items concerning the mental health and stress (v) potential solutions suggested by the interns. Results. 316 dental interns responded to this survey. Only 13.6% of them felt that the e-platforms were useful tools for learning. The dental interns felt that Conservative Dentistry and Oral Surgery postings had the maximum impact on clinical skills. Less than one-fourth (23.1%) of them agreed with the fact that they were under parental pressure;43.4% agreed that the pandemic had affected the confidence and preparedness to start their clinical practice. Conclusion. It was observed that the interns faced major challenges due to the missed hours of clinical practice, which affected them in terms of preparedness and confidence in facing their future.","Kumar, M.; Madi, M.; Vineetha, R.; Pentapati, K.

"Eating Behaviors and Physical Activity Associated With Stress, Anxiety, and Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Introduction. As a preventive measure to limit contagion in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, confinement was implemented. This event limited the availability of food and favored the consumption of less healthy processed and non-perishable foods, behaviors that can be seen related to mental health disorders such as stress, anxiety and depression. Methods. It's quantitative, descriptive, cross-sectional study, with non-probabilistic convenience sampling carried out between August-October, 2020 with the participation of 1657 Latin American people from the general population. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 questionnaire and the eating behaviors questionnaire associated with stress, anxiety and depression-17 were applied. Ordinal logistic regression was used to assess the association between variables. Results. 62% presented some degree of depression, 55.9% anxiety and 55.2% stress. An association was found between stress with physical activity (p 0.048), fish consumption (p 0.041), water (p 0.003), breads / desserts (p 0.005), fast foods (p &lt;0.001), sugary drinks (p 0.035), tea and infusions (p 0.023) and cocoa and its derivatives (p 0.018);anxiety with physical activity (p 0.006), intake of vegetables (p 0.022), fish (p 0.031), oils (p 0.008), breads / desserts (p 0.026), fast foods (p &lt;0.001), tea and infusions (p 0.018), cocoa and derivatives (p 0.038) and vitamin supplements (p 0.016);depression with physical activity (p 0.037), consumption of fruits (p 0.012), water (p 0.012), coffee (p 0.045), breads / desserts (p 0.003), fast foods (p &lt;0.001).

"COMMUNITY SOCIAL SOLIDARITY MODEL AND STRATEGIES FOR MAINTAINING MENTAL HEALTH DUE TO THE IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC BASED ON THE LOCAL WISDOM OF THE BANYUMAS COMMUNITY-CENTRAL JAVA PROVINCE-INDONESIA","In December 2020, Indonesian people were still shaken by the corona virus (COVID-19) pandemic. The government is trying to deal with this outbreak. So far, the emergency public activity restrictions (PPKM Darurat), level 1-4 has been extended several times. The number of positive COVID-19 patients is still relatively high, although the number continues to decline, so that anxiety among the public is still visible. It affects people's mental health. The Banyumas Regency Government has made every effort to overcome this problem, but has not succeeded because there are still a lot of people who do not care about handling COVID-19. This studyaims to (a) map interaction problems in dealing with the corona virus, (b) social solidarity and (c) strategies taken to maintain mental health. The method of the research is qualitative with an embedded-case study, female informants from dasa wisma (a group consisting of 10-20 family heads that are close together), people infected with the corona virus, neighborhood unit (RT) officers. The informant collection technique is purposive sampling, data was taken by in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and observation, while the analysis used is interactive analysis. The results show that the social interactions of rural and urban communities in responding to neighbors who are positively infected with COVID-19 are different. Rural communities tend to ""isolate"" people affected by COVID-19 because they still have a relatively low understanding of COVID-19, while urban communities tend to be more open. In general, thesocial solidarity that is built is relatively the same, namely mechanical solidarity with different technicalities according to the situation and conditions of the surrounding community. Social solidarity built on â€œjogo roso and jogo tonggoâ€ (neighbors respect and care for one another), the strong role of dasa wisma and PKK (Family Welfare Movement) women team in neighborhood unit level (RT). The strategies taken to maintain the mental health of people affected by COVID-19 and the surrounding community in general are taking a religious approach, getting closer to God, watching YouTube videos, reading the Quran, listening to religious lectures on TV, readingbooks about COVID-19, drinking herbal ingredients and thinking positively. To support the health workers, the women from dasa wisma are trained and equipped with the basic skills of checking temperature, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and supervision. The implications and roles of RT and RW (community units) administrators are further enhanced in socializing the understanding of the corona virus by implementing crisis management.","Suyanto, E.; Lestari, S.; Widyastuti, T.

"Modified body â€“ symbol of risk or resources?","Aim. Tattooing and body piercing are becoming more and more popular. The psychological approach to body modifications remains heterogeneous. The purpose of this replication was to assess the level of life satisfaction and self-esteem, as well as to reveal subjectively experienced symptoms of mental health disorders in people who reported having a tattoo and/ or piercing during the coronavirus epidemic. Method. The research was conducted in the period from April to June 2020 in an on-line form. Participants (N = 557) were 15â€“68 years old. Results: There were no significant differences in perceived life satisfaction, self-esteem and mental health assessment between people with and without body modifications. The revealed differences in the dimensions of self-esteem and the number of subjective depressive symptoms turned out to be accidental. Conclusions. All participants in the study (regardless of having body modification) were aware of having and the ability to use personal resources to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. Body modifications should not be considered a risk factor. Especially among tattooed people, the self-assessment of psychological functioning increased with the increase in life satisfaction.","Lammek, M.

"Existential Well-being, Mental Health, and COVID-19: Reconsidering the Impact of Lockdown Stressors in Moscow","Background. Initial psychological papers on COVID-19, mental health and well-being mostly focus on the aftermath lockdown-related stress and stress related to the disease itself. Still, we presume that personal well-being can be resistant to stressors depending on the way the person is settled in their life. Objective. We seek to reconsider the contribution of lockdown-related stressors to existential well-being, to assess existential well-being during the outbreak and to compare the contribution of living conditions and COVID-19-related factors on well-being. Design. An online survey was conducted during the peak of the outbreak in Moscow (April-May 2020) (N=880). The data was obtained using the ""Test of Existential Motivations"" questionnaire and a series of questions addressing (1) living conditions - mental and physical health, employment, and social distancing;(2) COVID-19-related stressors - non-chronic illness, financial losses, and unavailability of goods or services;(3) sociodemographic indicators - age, gender, and income. Data analysis included hierarchical multiple regression, one-sample t-test, and analysis of variance. Results. Surprisingly, the existential well-being of Moscow citizens during the research period was moderate. Each of the three groups of factors predicted a similar proportion of the variance of well-being (3-3,9%). The strongest predictors of well-being were long-term mental health status and financial stability. The effect of COVID-19-related stressors was most pronounced when they co-occur. Conclusion. The negative association between lockdown-related stressors and poor well-being is not universal. It is necessary to study the effect of COVID-19-related stressors in combination with individual living conditions and region -specific factors and to focus on the prevention of the occurrence of stressors.","Klimochkina, A.

"Influence of physical activity on psychological states in adults during the covid-19 pandemic","Introduction: Long periods of home confinement may lead to fear, panic, anxiety, and depression states, which, in turn, could drive to a reduction of active lifestyles. Objetive: To determine the association between the characteristics of the physical activity performed and the risk of experiencing mental health issues among people during confinement. Methods: A multicenter, cross-sectional, and observational study design was conducted in Iberoamerican countries with a sample of 4,948 participants, selected through a snowball sampling technique. The study started on March 15th, 2020, and was completed in August 2020 through an online survey that included demographic and medical data, mental health status, and physical activity characteristics. Results: Brazilian women aged between 18 and 29 who stayed at home more than 19 hours per day presented a relevant higher risk for all the mental health problems analyzed in this study. A low level of physical activity during the isolation period presents the highest probability of depression compared to higher levels (OR = 1.317). In addition, using a no professional resource to do physical activity is a predictive factor of adverse mental health status (OR Anxiety = 1.396, OR Depression = 1.452, and OR Stress = 1.220). Conclusions: A low level of physical activity during a long isolation period is associated with a higher prevalence of depression, and the use of professional resources for physical activity may be a protective factor for mental health disorders.","Camacho-Cardenosa, A.; Camacho-Cardenosa, M.; Merellano-Navarro, E.; TrapÃ©, Ã A.; Apolinario, T.; Brazo-Sayavera, J.","https://doi.org/10.11606/issn.2176-7262.rmrp.2022.192222","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Medicina (Brazil); 55(2), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36521,""
"Optimizing the Role of Urban Open Space in Supporting the Increasing of Public Awareness and Compliance with Health Protocols during the Pandemic","The level of the spread of covid-19, which is still high in the city of Semarang, indicates the low level of public awareness in complying with health protocols. The role of urban open space in Semarang City needs to be optimized to support this effort by adding several facilities that did not exist before the pandemic, so that people comply with health protocols, wear masks, wash their hands frequently and maintain physical distance when carrying out their social activities. The aim of this study is to determine how to optimize the role of public open space in supporting efforts to maintain the health of urban communities based on public awareness in complying with health protocols when doing activities. The research was conducted in three open spaces in Semarang, Indonesia, using survey methods and a descriptive qualitative analysis by observing the physical condition of the park, the behavior of the people in doing their activities, and park management officers. The results show that the three locations are now equipped with supporting facilities, but they are less effective in forcing people to remain obedient when doing activities. The level of public awareness and compliance has not met expectations and most of the people are still ignorant.

The number of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, and loneliness has increased tremendously during the lockdown period. Various studies suggest that these mental health issues could be coped with if people are allowed to access urban greeneries and public green spaces during the pandemic. However, the degree to how adequate existing green areas are to fulfil an urban community's needs with strict social distancing compliance is still vaguely interpreted in the literature. It is still arguable that the current 10 per cent green area requirement is still relevant to the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to determine the sufficient amount of green areas for people's well-being during the pandemic, based on the local population, accessibility to green areas, and compliance with the new norm of social distancing by a minimum of one meter. Therefore, an urban neighbourhood in Iskandar Puteri, Johor, Malaysia was selected and simulated using GIS spatial analysis based on the highlighted parameters. As a result, the study found that the current size of existing green areas in the neighbourhood is insufficient in terms of compliance with the parameters, especially Malaysia's social distancing requirements. This study could provide a platform for future planning to include pandemic risk reduction into urban planning policies, especially in the context of Malaysia, to cater to future uncertainties (C) 2022 Penerbit UTM Press.

"Views on virtual education during the COVID-19 pandemic among medical and paramedical students in India","The COVID-19 pandemic has made the educational institutions to implement the mandatory virtual learning in medical education. It is undeniable that electronic gadget aided learning have a significant role to play during a pandemic. Both faculty and students are getting accustomed to this 'New Normalcy'. Therefore, it is of interest to determine the effectiveness and perception of virtual teaching and learning during the COVID 19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted in which 336 medical and 336 paramedical students of both the genders with age group of 17 - 21 years participated. The data obtained were analyzed using the SPSS software. The shift from class room teaching to virtual learning has led to many health issues among students such as eye strain, anxiety, depression, musculoskeletal problems and obesity. The students also had inadequate time to interact with faculties. Data shows that virtual learning an alternative mode to traditional method during a pandemic.","Francis, Y. M.; Sankaran, P.

"Correlation Between Stress, Anxiety, and Depression Related to COVID-19 Pandemic among Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Non-compliance to Treatment: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background: The prevalence of anxiety and depression is high in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. As RA patients tend to be immunodeficient, they are at greater risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection due to their scheduled hospital appoint-ments. Therefore, they have become more anxious and worried during COVID-19 pandemic, and some patients recently have can-celed or postponed their treatment. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the effect of stress, anxiety, and depression due to COVID-19 outbreak on non-compliance to treatment among RA patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we included 149 RA patients (male/female = 12: 137). Four questionnaires, including the 21-item Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), 14-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), 18-item Health Anxiety Inventory (HAI-18), and 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) were employed. The questionnaires were filled by the researchers on behalf of the participants using telephone interviews due to social distancing protocol. Results: There was a significant negative correlation between stress (P = 0.001), anxiety (P &lt; 0.001), health anxiety (P = 0.014), and depression (P = 0.001) and compliance to treatment among RA patients. However, anxiety was the only predictor for non-compliance to treatment. Conclusions: Therapists should be aware of the symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression among their RA patients, especially during stressful life events, and carefully monitor their compliance to treatment to prevent exacerbation of RA.","Tasorian, B.; Tabatabaei, M.; Shayganfard, M.","https://doi.org/10.5812/semj-117966","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Shiraz E Medical Journal; 23(9), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36525,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic and Caregiving of Old Adults with Chronic Nervous System Disease","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and the concomitant quarantine have significantly reduced old adults' independence in doing daily or functional activities. Thus, they require more support and help at home. Because of the effect of the disease's progression and the adverse effects of quarantine on patients' functional status, old adults' caregivers might have been affected too. Objectives: The present research aimed to explore the role of the caregiving burden in the relationship between old adults' functional status and caregivers' mental health. Methods: The research population comprised caregiver families of old adults afflicted with chronic nervous diseases during the pandemic. To this aim, a sample of 249 caregiver families of old adults suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or stroke participated in this study. Data were collected using three online questionnaires of Lawton's instrumental activities of daily living scale (IADL), Novak's caregiver burden inventory, and Goldberg's mental health questionnaire. Data analysis was administered by Pearson's correlation coefficient and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: Correlation analysis and SEM results showed that the patients' functional status and caregivers' mental health had a significant, positive correlation, which was mediated by the caregiving burden variable. Conclusions: It can be concluded that better functional status of old adults can lead to a lower caregiving burden. Also, it can significantly improve caregivers' mental health and increase the old adults' and caregivers' quality of life.","Ferizi, M. M.; Aali, S.; Bigdeli, I.; Rezaeitalab, F.; Tavalaei, A.

"Internal communication, wellbeing and happiness at work in Spanish hospital institutions during the COVID-19 crisis","Communication is a priority element in the management of organisations, especially in times of crisis, as both internally and externally it can facilitate its containment. In the case of COVID-19, given the rapid spread of the pandemic, the impact was global in a very short period of time, so that organisations were forced to adapt to an unprecedented situation. One of the elements that became important in this adaptation process was internal communication, which helped to maintain cohesion between members of the organisation in a period when physical distance and isolation were widespread. Aspects such as managing remote working, loyalty, keeping staff aligned with corporate objectives and the mental health of employees became important issues. In the case of the health sector, whose work has been essential in this period of time, aspects such as communication with employees, effective and decisive leadership, prevention of stress, burnout and compassion fatigue, self-care, people management, promotion of training and knowledge or support in decision-making became particularly important. This work is framed within the area of study of organisational communication aimed at internal audiences, specifically in its relationship with organisational wellbeing and happiness in the field of healthcare institutions. It argues that Spanish hospital institutions strengthened their internal communication during the COVID-19 crisis as a key factor in dealing with the situation, despite the fact that organisational happiness and well-being are aspects that are still underdeveloped in these institutions. Two general objectives are established: to determine the role of internal communication in Spanish hospitals during the pandemic and to describe the policies of well-being and promotion of corporate happiness that have taken place during this time in the organisations studied. The secondary objectives are to identify the internal communication policies that have been developed, to establish the tools and channels used during this period, to study the role that the promotion of the well-being and happiness of the staff plays in the organisations and to describe the policies that have been implemented in this area. Through a document review and a semi-structured questionnaire in which 17 Spanish hospitals, mostly privately owned, participated, this research aims to determine the role of internal communication in these centres during the pandemic, as well as to describe the policies of well-being and promotion of corporate happiness that have taken place during this time in the organisations studied. The results indicate that the hospitals were forced to strengthen their internal communication to maintain control of the situation, implementing tools and encouraging communication with leaders and managers. However, the lack of formal management of staff wellbeing and happiness is evident in most of these institutions, as the organisational charts of these institutions lack specific departments or directorates for this purpose, resulting in scarce financial resources being allocated to these issues. Despite the mental and physical health problems of healthcare workers during the pandemic reported in the literature, the measures developed are still limited and often lack a specific budget. This work shows that there has been progress in the field of internal communication in hospitals in recent times, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, but that it is still a field with a lot of potential to be exploited, especially with regard to new technologies and social platforms","Castro-Martinez, A.; Diaz-Morilla, P.; Torres-Martin, J.

"Optimists' and pessimists' self-reported mental and global health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway","BACKGROUND The COVID-19 pandemic represents a global health crisis. How well people cope with this situation depends on many factors, including one's personality, such as dispositional optimism. The aim of the study was to investigate: 1) optimists' and pessimists' concerns during lockdown, and mental and global health;2) whether pessimists without known risk factors more often than optimists report being at risk for COVID-19. PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE A snowball sampling strategy was used;4.527 people, 18 years or older, participated in a survey on a variety of mental health conditions and COVID-19 worries. In addition, they completed the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R). Optimism was defined by LOT-R f &gt;= 17. RESULTS Fewer optimists than pessimists reported that they were worried about COVID-19, respectively 51.2% vs. 66.8%, p &lt; .001. Among those reporting none of the known somatic risk factors, more pessimists than optimists (14.3% vs. 9.1%, p &lt; .001) considered themselves at risk of a fatal outcome from COVID-19. Significantly fewer optimists reported that they had anxiety (5.1%), depression (3.4%). suicidal ideation (0.7%) and insomnia (19.3%) during the COVID-19 outbreak than pessimists (24.7% anxiety, 18.4% depression. 5.4% suicidal ideation, 39.8% insomnia, all p &lt; .001). Optimists reported better global health than pessimists (87.2 vs. 84.6, p &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS Optimists were generally less worried about the COVID-19 pandemic than pessimists and reported better mental and global health during lockdown. Pessimists more often than optimists reported being at risk for COVID-19 without reporting known risk factors.","Schou-Bredal, I.; Grimholt, T.; Bonsaksen, T.; Skogstad, L.; Heir, T.; Ekeberg, O.","https://doi.org/10.5114/hpr.2021.102394","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Psychology Report; 9(2):160-168, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36529,""
"PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS FROM POLAND AND BELARUS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: REFLECTIONS ON THE PURPOSE OF A RESEARCH PROJECT","Knowledge of the medical-psychological and socio-cultural determinants of physical activity (PA) and mental health is still unsatisfactory.

The aim of the proposed project is to determine PA levels and psychological adaptation to stress among students from Poland and Belarus in the context of different anti-pandemic strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. John Paul II University of Applied Sciences in Biala Podlaska (Poland) and Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno (Belarus) were chosen for the study, as despite the universities being located a relatively small distance from each other, they are in different countries and subject to different anti-pandemic strategies. The proposed survey will include approximately 800 medical and health sciences students (approximately 400 from each university). Nine standardized survey instruments will be used: IPAQ-SF, MBI, SWLS, CECS, GSES, Mini-COPE, STAI, TSK, and GHQ-28.

"NEUROSTIMULATING COMPLEXES OF PHYSICAL EXERCISES TO NEUTRALIZE LONG COVID","The mankind has been fighting the coronavirus infection for almost two years. This is the first time the world is facing a pandemic of such a huge scale. As a result of COVID-19 spread around the world, the researchers have identified a number of concerns in the field of medicine, psychiatry and public health. After the first pandemic wave of COVID-19, the doctors have found out extremely unfavorable changes in the physical and mental health of people, namely the disease has had a negative effect on psychical and emotional state of the population, especially students. The researchers in the field of medicine and health have identified pathological changes after recovery from the coronavirus infection (long COVID). Almost everyone who had a COVID-19 infection experienced a post-COVID-19 syndrome, regardless of the severity of the disease. Nowadays, the specialists cannot determine the true causes of long COVID and completely assess its consequences [1]. Among the post-COVID-19 symptoms, there are poor health (fatigue, insomnia, very low physical activity, musculoskeletal pain, etc.);nervous system and neurocognitive disorders (panic attacks, depression, increased anxiety);respiratory system disorders;cardiovascular disorders (bronchospasms, shortness of breath, chest pains, severe headaches, poor coordination, blood pressure disorders, sharp appetite reduction, asthenia). As a result, there is a failure in the cerebral cortex work affecting memory, attentiveness, planning, motivation [2,3]. Despite all age groups can be affected by long COVID, there has been published little research on the recovery status of the younger generation, namely students. As a result, this condition causes a failure of the adaptive systems of a human body and its immunity deterioration. Unfortunately, medicine has not provided the basic means of getting rid of the COVID-19 consequences yet. Most often, the rehabilitation of the post-COVID-19 syndrome lasts 6-12 months. Most researchers have proposed to fight with long COVID both with drugs and by means of physical culture, exercising and breathing exercises, preferably in the open air [4]. Physical activity, regular physical exercises and sports have been recognized as an effective method for regulating the psychical and emotional state of a person.","Postol, O.; Shchadilova, I.","https://doi.org/10.5114/hpc.2021.110038","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Health Problems of Civilization; 16(1):3-4, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36531,""
"Factors Contributing to SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Hesitancy of Hispanic Population in Rio Grande Valley","Hispanic communities have been disproportionately affected by economic disparities. These inequalities have put Hispanics at an increased risk for preventable health conditions. In addition, the CDC reports Hispanics to have 1.5&times;COVID-19 infection rates and low vaccination rates. This study aims to identify the driving factors for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy of Hispanic survey participants in the Rio Grande Valley. Our analysis used machine learning methods to identify significant associations between medical, economic, and social factors impacting the uptake and willingness to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. A combination of three classification methods (i.e., logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) was used to classify observations based on the value of the targeted responses received and extract a robust subset of factors. Our analysis revealed different medical, economic, and social associations that correlate to other target population groups (i.e., males and females). According to the analysis performed on males, the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) value was 0.972. An MCC score of 0.805 was achieved by analyzing females, while the analysis of males and females achieved 0.797. Specifically, several medical, economic factors, and sociodemographic characteristics are more prevalent in vaccine-hesitant groups, such as asthma, hypertension, mental health problems, financial strain due to COVID-19, gender, lack of health insurance plans, and limited test availability.","Bikaki, Athina, Machiorlatti, Michael, Clark, Loren Cliff, Robledo, Candace A.; Kakadiaris, Ioannis A.","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10081282","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Vaccines; 10(8):1282, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36532,""
"Coping Strategies for Household Food Insecurity, and Perceived Health in an Urban Community in Southern Mozambique: A Qualitative Study","In low- and middle-income countries, food insecurity (FI) is a living reality for many households, particularly among the most vulnerable groups. The burden of household FI in Mozambique and how FI and coping strategies relate to perceived health are unknown. This study investigated the lived experiences and coping strategies of food-insecure households, along with their perceived health. Altogether, 16 in-depth interviews were performed, audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. A qualitative content analysis was carried out and five themes emerged: lived experiences of FI, coping strategies used in situations of FI, food choices, climate change and food security, and FI and perceived health. A wide range of lived experiences and coping strategies were reported, including cooking whatever is available, skipping meals, receiving money or food from friends and relatives, eating unsafe and low-quality foods, taking on additional work, cooking least-preferred foods, and having a monotonous and less-nutritious diet. Furthermore, the participants reported emotional distress, anxiety and depression, substance use, and other negative health outcomes. Some had diagnoses of hypertension, diabetes or HIV/AIDS. The findings suggest the need for employment creation and women's empowerment, as well as the implementation of appropriate policies and programmes to alleviate household FI.","Militao, E. M.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Psychological Well-Being of Catholic Priests in Canada","Among the general population, frontline workers have been identified to be at heightened risk for negative mental health consequences related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Catholic priests, who minister to approximately 30% of Canadians, in their role as frontline workers, have been profoundly limited in the provision of pastoral care due to public health restrictions. However, little is known about the impact pandemic distress has on this largely understudied population. Four hundred and eleven Catholic priests across Canada participated in an online survey during May and June 2021. Multiple regression analysis examined how depression, anxiety, traumatic impact of events, loneliness, and religious coping style affect the psychological well-being, satisfaction as a priest, and priestly identity of participants. Results demonstrated that pandemic distress significantly impacts the psychological well-being of priest participants. Depression and loneliness surfaced as significant considerations associated with lowered psychological well-being. While neither anxiety nor traumatic distress reached a significance threshold, the religious coping style of participants emerged as an important factor in the psychological well-being of priests. Results of the study contribute to the understanding of how the pandemic has impacted a less visible group of frontline workers.","Kappler, Stephan, Okozi, Innocent, Diouf, Francois, Hartinger, Katharina","https://doi.org/10.3390/rel13080718","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Religions; 13(8):718, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36534,""
"Escaping the Reality of the Pandemic: The Role of Hopelessness and Dissociation in COVID-19 Denialism","Background: Denialism of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely affected governments' attempts to contain the spread of the virus. Indeed, groups of deniers showed scepticism and misinformation toward the causes of the virus, leading to less adherence to official guidelines and vaccination campaigns. The present study aimed to investigate the sociodemographic and psychological factors associated with COVID-19 denialism, expressed in the forms of scepticism, nonadherence to guidelines, and negative attitudes toward vaccination. Methods: Four hundred and sixty-one volunteers completed an online survey composed of the Beck Hopelessness Scale, the Dissociative Experiences Scale-II, the Sense of Community Index, and a questionnaire about COVID-19 denialism. Results: The multiple regression analyses showed that higher age and a lower level of education were positive predictors of COVID-19 denialism. Furthermore, the structural equation model showed that hopelessness positively predicted dissociation and negatively predicted the sense of community. In turn, only dissociation was found to positively predict COVID-19 denialism. Conclusions: The findings of the present study suggested that hopelessness could exacerbate a defensive dissociative response that could be associated with greater COVID-19 denialism. Moreover, older and less educated people showed a greater propensity to engage in COVID-19 denialism.","Ciacchella, Chiara, Veneziani, Giorgio, Bagni, Claudio, Campedelli, Virginia, Del Casale, Antonio, Lai, Carlo","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm12081302","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 12(8):1302, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36535,""

Recreation areas bring a lot of benefits to society, also in terms of mental health. Open space and contact with nature, particularly during a crisis such as the pandemic, help alleviate the effects of the lockdown and social isolation. The study objective was to determine whether and to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the importance of recreation areas and the perception of landscape among students-a social group that experiences mood disorders increasingly often and has been severely affected by the lockdown. A survey was conducted in two stages, using a Google Forms online survey. A total of 381 students from universities in Lublin participated in the survey. The survey showed that the significance of recreation areas increased during the pandemic. The perception of landscape changed as well: the value of nature, scenic views, and the therapeutic effect of the landscape began to be appreciated to a greater extent. The survey results indicate the need to ensure the diversity of green areas and improve their accessibility. Designing these areas should also consider quiet areas as well as ensuring green mobility and places of recreation.","Bernat, Sebastian, Trykacz, Karolina, Skibinski, Jakub","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169837","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9837, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36536,""
"The Effectiveness of a Leadership Subject Using a Hybrid Teaching Mode during the Pandemic: Objective Outcome and Subjective Outcome Evaluation","Positive youth development (PYD) is an innovative approach to protect students from mental health problems and promote their positive and holistic development. Although there are many studies on the beneficial effects of PYD programs on youth in high school and community contexts, it is not clear whether subjects adopting PYD principles can promote positive development for university students. Moreover, it is unclear whether such subjects are effective under COVID-19, where subjects are commonly taught via the 'hybrid';mode (i.e., face-to-face plus online teaching). The present study examined students' changes in the PYD, wellbeing, and desired graduate attributes after they had taken a leadership subject utilizing PYD principles taught by the 'hybrid';mode (N = 630). Adopting the one-group pre-test and post-test design (i.e., objective outcome evaluation), we found that students showed significant positive improvement in PYD indicators, wellbeing, as well as desired graduate attributes. Additionally, students had high satisfaction with the course design and teaching staff, and perceived many benefits from this subject based on the subjective outcome evaluation conducted at the end of the subject. Results also showed that students' satisfaction with the curriculum significantly and positively predicted their positive change in PYD indicators, indicating the convergence of subjective outcome evaluation and objective outcome evaluation. The results highlight the positive impacts of the hybrid mode leadership subject with PYD principles in higher education.","Chai, Wenyu, Li, Xiang, Shek, Daniel T.

This study obtains an understanding of the health and health-related social needs of youths experiencing homelessness during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A total of 14 youths between the ages of 14 and 24 who (a) lived, worked, or attended school in New Britain, Connecticut (CT) and (b) had at least one experience of homelessness or housing insecurity worked with the research team to conduct a needs assessment regarding youth homelessness. Using photovoice, a community-based participatory research method, participants created photo narratives to share their stories and recommendations for community change. The main goals of photovoice are to enable participants to (1) record and represent their everyday realities;(2) promote critical dialogue and knowledge about person and community strengths and concerns;and (3) reach policy makers. Results: Most of the participants identified as youths of color, and half of the participants identified as members of the LGBTQ+ community. Three major themes that appeared in the youths' narratives include the following: mental health and substance use challenges, trouble accessing basic human needs, and lack of a social support system. Conclusion: This study uplifts and empowers a vulnerable population to increase visibility around a major public health challenge from their own lived experiences. Despite the challenges that were voiced, many participants shared a sense of hope and resiliency. The major themes endorsed by the youths has the potential of informing practitioners and policy makers of how to better address the needs of youths experiencing homelessness, particularly those most at risk.","Damian, April Joy, Ponce, Delilah, Ortiz-Siberon, Angel, Kokan, Zeba, Curran, Ryan, Azevedo, Brandon, Gonzalez, Melanie","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169799","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9799, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36538,""
"Students' Attitudes toward COVID-19 Vaccination: An Inter-University Study from Bulgaria","In Bulgaria, vaccination coverage against the SARS-CoV-2 virus is low. The reasons for this fact are many and varied. The aim of the present study was to establish what the attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccination process are among students from various specialties from several Bulgarian universities. In this research, 600 students participated, divided into two groups: Doctor of Medicine (MD) students (n = 300) and non-MD students, i.e., students of specialties, such as mathematics, engineering, finance and economics, law, human sciences, etc. (n = 300). Each respondent completed a questionnaire which was divided into three parts with closed questions. The mean age of all students was 21.19 &plusmn;1.87 years (95% CI: 20.48&ndash;21.90). The female sex dominated among the analyzed participants (sex ratio: female/male = 1/0.85). Nearly 62% (371/600) of individuals declared that they have been COVID-19 vaccinated with at least one dose (p &lt; 0.001). Overall, 33% of the participants sought information on vaccines from video sharing platforms and 36.0% (216/600) from social media platforms. From the conducted multivariable logistic regression the odds of vaccination against COVID-19 were 6.225 times higher in individuals with a positive attitude towards these vaccines than in people with a negative attitude towards them (p &lt; 0.001). We have found that those students who trust the international health organizations had an OR of 2.365 (p = 0.004) to be SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated. We estimated that the odds of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 among children were 4.794 times higher in parents (students) who had been vaccinated than in non-vaccinated parents (students) (p &lt; 0.001). Our results could support the national public health organizations, the national educational/scientific systems, and the management of Bulgarian universities in making future decisions about the field of COVID-19 control and prevention.","Moskova, Martina, Zasheva, Anelia, Kunchev, Metodi, Popivanov, Ivan, Dimov, Dimo, Vaseva, Virsavia, Kundurzhiev, Todor, Tsachev, Ilia, Baymakova, Magdalena","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19169779","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(16):9779, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36539,""
"Toxicological Analysis of Illicit Drugs Seized in Naples (Italy) and First Detection of Synthetic Cannabinoids during COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has consistently raised the number of drug seizures, in United States as in Europe. The COVID-19 pandemic has also changed the typology of seizures from 'more traditional';drugs to New Psychoactive Substances (NPSs), depending on geographical area. In Europe, the most frequent NPSs are synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) and cathinones, nonetheless synthetic opioids and phenethylamines are widely used. The aim of the study is the detection of NPS and other substances of abuse available in the black market, by quali/quantitative methods in LC-MS/MS and GC-MS. From 2018 to 2021, 268 seizures occurred in total and were analyzed by the Forensic Toxicology Laboratory (FTL) of Naples (Italy). The distribution of analyzed seizures over the years is the following: 53 in 2018, 61 in 2019, 89 in 2020 and 65 during the first semester of 2021. Cannabis was the most detected drug both in hashish and marijuana seizures, followed by cocaine &gt; heroine &gt; prescribed drugs &gt; ketamine&ndash;amphetamine MDMA. No NPSs were seized until June 2021, when NPSs were found in two different seizures: Case #1 showed a bar of Cannabis resin containing a low level of &Delta;9THC = 0.57% associated to SC AB-FUBINACA in 4.5%;Case #2 showed a vegetal resinous substance (&Delta;9THC = 0.27%) with SC 5F-APINACA (4.1%) associated with methadone (1.0%). The detection of NPSs is alarming evidence that can lead to an increase in the risk of overdose or other negative and unpredictable consequences, such as violent or self-harming behavior in unaware users of cannabis derivatives considered of 'natural';origin.","Carfora, Anna, Petrella, Raffaella, Ambrosio, Giusy, Fracassi, Ilaria, Festinese, Stefano, Feola, Alessandro, Campobasso, Carlo Pietro","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081488","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Healthcare; 10(8):1488, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36540,""
"Measuring the Impact of Language Models in Sentiment Analysis for Mexico's COVID-19 Pandemic","The world has been facing the COVID-19 pandemic, which has come with an unprecedented impact on general physical health and financial and social repercussions. The adopted mitigation measures also present significant challenges to the population's mental health and health-related programs. It is complex for public organizations to measure the population's mental health to incorporate its feedback into their decision-making process. A significant portion of the population has turned to social media to express the details of their daily life, making these public data a rich field for understanding emotional and mental well-being. To this end, by using open sentiment analysis tools, we analyzed 760,064,879 public domain tweets collected from a public access repository to examine the collective shifts in the general mood about the pandemic evolution, news cycles, and governmental policies. Several modern language models were evaluated and compared using intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, that is, the sentiment analysis evaluation of public domain tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Mexico. This study provides a fair evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, such as BERT and VADER, showcasing their metrics and comparing their performance against a real-world task. Results show the importance of selecting the correct language model for large projects such as this one, for there is a need to balance costs with the model's performance.","LeÃ³n-Sandoval, Edgar, Zareei, Mahdi, Barbosa-SantillÃ¡n, Liliana Ibeth, FalcÃ³n Morales, Luis Eduardo","https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics11162483","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Electronics; 11(16):2483, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36541,""

"Burnout, Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Among Family Physicians in Kansas: 18 Months into the COVID-19 Pandemic","Given the significant turmoil during the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors evaluated burnout and other types of emotional distress experienced by family physicians in Kansas during the second year of the pandemic. The authors compared findings of this study to a similar study conducted 3 months into the pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey of 272 actively practicing family physicians in Kansas was conducted from September 15 to October 18, 2021. A 34-item questionnaire was used to measure the physicians' levels of burnout, personal depression, anxiety, and stress. A mixed method approach was used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data. Descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test/independent samples <i>t</i>-test, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>, adjusted odds ratio, and immersion-crystallization methods were used to analyze the data. The response rate was 48.9% (n = 133). In aggregate, 69.2% of respondents reported at least 1 manifestation of professional burnout in 2021 compared with 50.4% in 2020; P Ã¢â€°Â¤ .01). The 2021 respondents were at higher odds of experiencing burnout compared with 2020 respondents (aOR = 1.86; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.57; P = .046). The respondents who reported at least 1 manifestation of professional burnout were more likely to screen positive for depression (aOR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.31-2.66; P Ã¢â€°Â¤ .01), report higher levels of anxiety (aOR = 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04-2.24; P = .013), and higher levels of stress (aOR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.17-1.66; P Ã¢â€°Â¤ .001). As the COVID-19 pandemic continued, there are significant and worsening rates of professional burnout and other forms of emotional distress among family physicians. These findings suggest timely need for appropriate psychological supports.","Ofei-Dodoo, Loo-Gross, Kellerman","https://doi.org/10.3122/jabfm.2022.AP.220045","20220825","COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Physicians; Kansas; Mental Health; Occupational Burnout; Pandemics; Surveys and Questionnaires","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36543,""
"Vengeance is whose? Applying the interpersonal theory of suicide to the titular character in Lev Tolstoy's Anna Karenina","Suicide is a leading cause of death around the world. Prior to Covid-19 suicide was the tenth overall leading cause of death in the United States, and the second overall amongst adolescents and young adults with a disproportiante impact on ethnic and social minority groups. Despite its unfortunate prevalence much remains to be learned about the underlying neurobiological factors implicated in death by suicide. From a psycho-social perspective, the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide (Joiner, 2007; Van Orden et al., 2010) posits three necessary factors leading to suicidal desire and behaviours, namely thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and an acquired capacity for self-injury. Given the universality of suicidal behaviours, this theory should be applicable across both cultures and eras. In this article I aim to apply the Interpersonal Theory of Suicide to one of the most famous literary deaths by suicide, that of Tolstoy's Anna Karenina.","Cumming","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2022.08.044","20220825","Interpersonal theory; Suicide; World literature","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36544,""
"Mental health, functioning and quality of life between work in the office and work from home employees during first wave of COVID19 in Brazil","COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic early in 2020, period that governments imposed strict measures of social distancing to slow its transmission. However, most essential services remained open, and the work in the office faced a higher risk of infection compared to work in home. We compare the occurrence and potential determinants of mental health outcomes, functioning and quality of life in a sample of Brazilian individuals who worked from home and those who worked in the office during the first wave of COVID-19. Data were collected during the first wave of COVID-19, using an online survey to assess sociodemographic and clinical variables, functioning (FAST-D), quality of life (EUROhisQOL), depression (PROMIS depression), anxiety (PROMIS anxiety), and stress symptoms (IES-R scale) in a huge sample consisted of individuals who worked in office (n=1685) and worked from home (n=1338). Analysis revealed that depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms were less prevalent in individuals who worked from home as well as they have higher functioning and quality of life than those worked in the office. Individuals who worked in the office were younger, more likely to be female, had lower household income level, low education levels and were more unmarried than the other group. Our findings support the notion of the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in both work in the office and work from home; however, the group who worked from home seems to be more resilient with less psychiatric symptoms and better functioning.","Serafim, Goularte, Dalpiaz, Caldieraro, Rosa","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2022-0537","20220825","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; functioning; post-traumatic stress disorder; quality of life; work from home; work in office","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36545,""
"Factors associated with Facebook addiction among university students amid the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from an online cross-sectional survey","Facebook addiction (FA) has been suggested as a potential behavioral addiction. There is a severe lack of research evidence regarding the Facebook addiction behavior among university students during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine factors associated with Facebook addiction among Bangladeshi university students. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 2,161 Bangladeshi university students during the COVID-19 pandemic from June 2021 to September 2021. A well fitted regression model in R programming language was used for this study. Female respondents and those whose family monthly income was &lt;25,000 BDT were more addicted to Facebook than other respondents. Respondents who lost a family member or a relative to COVID-19, engaged in physical activities (exercise) during the pandemic, used Facebook for work purposes or used Facebook to relieve daily stress were more addicted to Facebook. Overuse of social media is problematic as it can trigger several mental health symptoms, especially among students.

"Association between pregnancy intention and psychological distress among women exposed to different levels of restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on the mental health of people globally. Significant concerns about health and access to services among women of reproductive age considering pregnancy may cause psychological distress, and in turn increase health risks during and after pregnancy for mothers and offspring. To examine the association between pregnancy intention and psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, and explore if this association differed based on local viral transmission rates and corresponding levels of pandemic restrictions. A nationwide online survey was completed by 849 non-pregnant women aged 18-50 years between 15 October and 7 November 2020. Women were asked about their intention to become pregnant, and psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Multivariable regression analysis examined associations between pregnancy intention and psychological distress. An interaction term was added to the model to examine differences in associations by level of viral transmission rates and lockdown restrictions which was determined based on postcode. Pregnancy intention was not associated with experiencing (very) high psychological distress in the overall study population (odds ratio (OR) 1.42, 95% CI 0.94, 2.11). The interaction term (p = 0.09) suggested potential differences by level of restrictions and viral transmission rates. In stratified analysis among women living in a location with strict lockdown restrictions and high viral transmission rates leading up to and during the study, those planning to become pregnant were more likely to experience (very) high psychological distress (OR 3.39, 2.04, 5.65) compared with women not planning to become pregnant. Pregnancy intention was not associated with psychological distress among women exposed to lower levels of pandemic restrictions and viral transmission rates (OR 1.17, 0.74, 1.85). Our findings highlight the need to identify and support women planning pregnancy during a public health crisis to mitigate potential short- and long-term intergenerational negative health outcomes associated with psychological distress.","Schoenaker, Bennett, Grieger, Harrison, Hill, Enticott, Moran, Teede, O'Reilly, Lim","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273339","20220825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36547,""
"Experiencing the COVID-19 pandemic as a healthcare provider in rural Dhanbad, India: An interpretative phenomenological analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic is causing widespread morbidity and mortality. It has led to a myriad of mental health problems, particularly in health care providers (HCPs). To strengthen the fight against COVID-19, it is essential to investigate the mental health challenges being faced by the HCPs, their emotional responses, and coping strategies. We aimed to explore the lived experiences of frontline HCPs in rural India during the peak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through purposive heterogenous snowball sampling, five HCPs in rural Dhanbad were recruited and one-on-one double-blind unstructured interviews were conducted. The interviews were transcribed and master themes and subthemes were extracted by interpretative phenomenological analysis. Six master themes and 23 subthemes were identified. Our findings demonstrate that the participants were under mental duress due to heavy workloads, fear of getting infected and transmitting the infection, urban-rural disparities in access to medical supplies and peer support, and negative social perception of HCPs during the pandemic. Most HCPs have not yet processed the psychological effects of being at the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic in a resource-poor setting; however, spirituality seems to be an important coping mechanism that helps them get through the day. This study is unique in the sense that not many studies have been conducted to evaluate the psychological issues of Indian HCPs during this pandemic. Much less is known about the mental health of HCPs in rural settings. Moreover, novel findings such as negative social perception of HCPs during the pandemic and HCPs resorting to spirituality as a coping strategy against stress, open a plethora of research opportunities wherein the results of this qualitative study, along with the existing literature and findings of future quantitative studies, can establish better understanding of the impact of the pandemic on HCPs.","Konduru, Das, Kothari-Speakman, Behura","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273573","20220825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36548,""
"A person-centered approach to capture health disparities and multidimensional impact of COVID-related stressors","The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced people's lives in diverse ways. The authors utilized latent class analysis (LCA), a person-centered approach, to examine distinct patterns of COVID-related stressors and their associations with alcohol-related, mental health, and quality of life outcomes. Participants were 463 adults who completed the baseline assessment of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Alcohol Study from June 2020 to January 2022. Using cross-sectional data, three analytic methods (continuous sum score, categorical grouping, and LCA) were applied to model 17 COVID-related stressors. Regression analyses indicated higher COVID-related stress and endorsement of four or more COVID-related stressors were generally associated with worse health-related outcomes. LCA revealed four classes: Class 1: Minimal COVID-Related Impact (51.6%); Class 2: Work Interruptions (24.8%); Class 3: Family/Friends Affected by COVID (14.5%); and Class 4: Serious Financial Stress (9.1%). Racial/ethnic minorities were more likely to be in Class 3, whereas individuals with more years of education and higher income were less likely to be in Class 4. Individuals with a history of alcohol use disorder were more likely to be in Classes 2 and 4. Compared with Class 1, Class 4 reported highest levels of perceived stress, problematic alcohol use, anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, alcohol craving, loneliness, drinking to cope, and lowest levels of physical, psychological, social, and environment quality of life. COVID-related stressors disproportionately affected minority and vulnerable groups. Individuals who experienced multiple financial stressors had the greatest risk for negative health-related outcomes and may benefit from holistic interventions and community outreach.

"Impact of mobilization of residents in otolaryngology-head-neck surgery in COVID-19 units on mental health status","To investigate mental health, sleep, and addiction features of young otolaryngologists (YO) according to the mobilization in COVID-19 units at the end of the third European wave of infections. A cross-sectional survey was sent to 220 YO of 6 European University hospitals. The following outcomes were evaluated: postgraduate year; age; management of COVID-19 patients; workload; nights on call; stress; Beck depression inventory; Insomnia severity index; sleep and mental health status evolutions throughout pandemic; consumption of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs before and during pandemic. A total of 128 YO completed the evaluations (58.2%). Twenty responders (15.6%) did not manage COVID-19 patients, while 65 (50.8%), 20 (15.6%), and 23 (18%) managed rarely, frequently or daily COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, respectively. The management of COVID-19 patients was associated with increases of workload (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023) and number of nights on-call (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). At the end of the third wave, the depression rates were 34% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°31/68) and 57% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34/60) in YO who worked less and more than 50Ã‚Â h weekly, respectively. Sleep disturbance concerned 39% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°26/66) and 55% (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°27/60) of YO who worked less and more than 50Ã‚Â h weekly, respectively. Mobilized YO reported a significant increase of alcohol consumption compared with control group (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002). Tobacco and drugs consumptions did not evolve.

"A comparison of pain, fatigue, and function between post-COVID-19 condition, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome: a survey study","A growing number of individuals report prolonged symptoms following acute Coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) infection, known as post-COVID-19 condition (post-COVID-19). While studies have emerged investigating the symptom sequelae of post-COVID-19, there has been limited investigation into the characterization of pain, fatigue, and function in these individuals, despite initial reports of a clinical phenotype similar to fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME). This study aimed to characterize multiple symptom domains in individuals reporting post-COVID-19 and compare its clinical phenotype with those with FMS and CFS. A total of 707 individuals with a single or comorbid diagnosis of post-COVID-19, FMS, and/or CFS completed multiple surveys assessing self-reported pain, fatigue, physical and cognitive function, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia, anxiety, depression, dyspnea, and sleep quality. In all 3 diagnoses, elevated pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and kinesiophobia were reported. Physical and cognitive function were similarly impacted among individuals with post-COVID-19, FMS, and CFS; however, individuals with post-COVID-19 reported lower pain and fatigue than FMS and CFS. The comorbid diagnosis of post-COVID-19 with FMS and/or CFS further exacerbated pain, fatigue, and psychological domains when compared with post-COVID-19 alone. In summary, individuals with post-COVID-19 report a symptom phenotype similar to FMS and CFS, negatively impacting cognitive and physical function, but with less severe pain and fatigue overall. These findings may help direct future investigations of the benefit of a biopsychosocial approach to the clinical management of post-COVID-19.","Haider, Janowski, Lesnak, Hayashi, Dailey, Chimenti, Frey-Law, Sluka, Berardi","https://doi.org/10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002711","20220825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36551,""
"Temporal Variations and Spatial Clusters of Dengue in Thailand: Longitudinal Study before and during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic","The efforts towards effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the incidence of dengue. This study aimed to investigate temporal variations and spatial clusters of dengue in Thailand before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Reported dengue cases before (2011-2019) and during (2020-2021) the COVID-19 pandemic were obtained from the national disease surveillance datasets. The temporal variations were analyzed using graphics, a seasonal trend decomposition procedure based on Loess, and Poisson regression. A seasonal ARIMA model was used to forecast dengue cases. Spatial clusters were investigated using the local indicators of spatial associations (LISA). The cyclic pattern showed that the greatest peak of dengue cases likely changed from every other year to every two or three years. In terms of seasonality, a notable peak was observed in June before the pandemic, which was delayed by one month (July) during the pandemic. The trend for 2011-2021 was relatively stable but dengue incidence decreased dramatically by 7.05% and 157.80% on average in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The forecasted cases in 2020 were slightly lower than the reported cases (2.63% difference), whereas the forecasted cases in 2021 were much higher than the actual cases (163.19% difference). The LISA map indicated 5 to 13 risk areas or hotspots of dengue before the COVID-19 pandemic compared to only 1 risk area during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 pandemic, dengue incidence sharply decreased and was lower than forecasted, and the spatial clusters were much lower than before the pandemic.","Saita, Maeakhian, Silawan","https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed7080171","20220825","COVID-19; coronavirus disease; dengue; spatial clusters; temporal variations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36552,""
"Perioperative Management Strategies for the COVID-19 Pandemic at a Facility in China","The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 posed a public health crisis beginning in January 2020, affecting hospitals and health care personnel worldwide and disrupting perioperative services. Organization leaders at Xijing Hospital, Xi'an, China, developed a mitigation system for the OR that involved creating a pandemic response team to identify and implement appropriate infection control practices to prevent virus transmission. The leaders addressed managing the daily surgery schedule through patient screening and a focus on the urgency and volume of procedures. They required increased use of personal protective equipment and more stringent cleaning and disinfection protocols and ensured that the physical and mental health of staff members were monitored and prioritized. This article describes how leaders implemented these enhanced processes to protect personnel from infection as they continued to provide patient care. It also describes how high-risk procedures involving patients with confirmed or suspected infections were managed and discusses lessons learned.","Bian, Jia, Wang, Ma, Wang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1002/aorn.13765","20220825","coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); infection prevention and control; pandemic response team; patient screening; personal protective equipment (PPE)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36553,""
"Pharmacy Students' Mental Health and Resilience in COVID-19: An Assessment after One Year of Online Education","COVID-19 has impacted mental health and affected education due to the shift to remote learning. The purpose of the current study was to assess the mental health of pharmacy students one year following the onset of the pandemic. A descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to pharmacy students. The severity of depression, anxiety, and stress was assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21), and resilience was assessed by the Brief Resilience Scale (BRS). COVID-19-related economic, educational, and health stressors, and students' vaccine attitudes were surveyed. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analysis were used, and a <i>p</i>-value of &amp;lt;0.05 was considered significant. A total of 561 students participated; 37% had mild-to-moderate depression, 37% had severe-to-extremely-severe anxiety, and 52% demonstrated normal stress levels. Severe depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with smoking and feeling isolated due to COVID-19. Around 40% of students had low resilience, associated with smoking, being in the third or fourth year of pharmacy study, and the consumption of caffeinated beverages. The mean score of satisfaction with online learning was 60.3 Ã‚Â± 21.3%. Only 5% of participants were vaccinated, of which 87% trusted the benefits of vaccines and their role in controlling the pandemic. One year after the onset of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and low resilience were observed among pharmacy students; the investigation of the long-term mental effects of the pandemic on university students is warranted.","Hammoudi Halat, Younes, Safwan, Akiki, Akel, Rahal","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe12080077","20220825","BRS; COVID-19; DASS-21; mental health; pharmacy education; pharmacy students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36554,""
"Boredom in a Time of Uncertainty: State and Trait Boredom's Associations with Psychological Health during COVID-19","Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, studies have demonstrated increases in boredom and its negative impact on mental health. This cross-sectional study examines state and trait boredom at four different points of the pandemic using an online sample of participants from the United States (<i>n</i> = 783). The results showed significant increases in boredom proneness, state boredom, substance use, loneliness, and distress. Boredom was associated with increases in each of these variables and a greater likelihood of testing positive for COVID-19. Moreover, the increases in distress, loneliness, and substance use became non-significant when controlling for boredom. Boredom proneness remained associated with all adverse outcomes when accounting for state boredom. In contrast, the relationships between state boredom and most adverse outcomes lost significance when controlling for boredom proneness, and state boredom was positively associated with increased hope for the future. Overall, the results suggest that high boredom proneness is an important vulnerability factor for poor psychological health and risky behaviors during the pandemic. However, high levels of recent state boredom, independent of boredom proneness, do not predict similarly negative outcomes. State boredom may indicate the extent to which one remains hopeful that circumstances will improve without resorting to risky, potentially maladaptive coping strategies.","Weiss, Todman, Maple, Bunn","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12080298","20220825","COVID-19; boredom; boredom proneness; pandemic; state boredom; trait boredom","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36555,""

"Emergency Removal of Supervision Requirements for Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioners: A Mixed-Methods Survey","Physician supervision of nurse practitioners (NPs) was temporarily waived in Massachusetts in response to a state of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The authors examined the impact of the scope-of-practice changes and pandemic-related demands on psychiatric mental health NPs (PMHNPs) during the state's first COVID-19 surge. A mixed-methods Web-based survey was conducted in May and June of 2020. Fisher's exact test was used to compare associations across certification types, and inductive content analysis was applied to open-ended responses. The survey response rate was 41% (N=389 of 958), consisting of 26 PMHNPs and 363 other NPs. Compared with other NPs, PMHNPs were significantly more likely to work in a telehealth setting (42% vs. 11%, p&lt;0.001), to spend more time working during the initial surge (50% vs. 26%, p&lt;0.05), and to believe that the waiver improved clinical work (52% vs. 25%, p&lt;0.01). Content analysis of PMHNPs' open-ended responses identified four themes: the supervision waiver reduced burden on PMHNPs, collaboration and mentorship models persisted, the pandemic exacerbated the already high demand for psychiatric care, and telehealth helped meet the high demand for such care. PMHNPs may be more sensitive to the scope-of-practice changes and telehealth expansion than other NPs because of the constraints of the psychiatrist shortage and high relative uptake of telehealth in psychiatric care. The interactions of workforce supply, telehealth expansion, and scope-of-practice laws are important to consider in the development of policies to improve access to mental health care.","O'Reilly-Jacob, Tierney, Freeman, Perloff","https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.ps.202100725","20220825","COVID-19 pandemic; Mental health policy; Psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner; Psychiatric nursing; Public policy; Scope of practice","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36557,""
"Evaluation of COVID-19 pandemic on components of social and mental health using machine learning, analysing United States data in 2020","COVID-19 was named a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. Governments across the world issued various restrictions such as staying at home. These restrictions significantly influenced mental health worldwide. This study aims to document the prevalence of mental health problems and their relationship with the quality and quantity of social relationships affected by the pandemic during the United States national lockdown. Sample data was employed from the COVID-19 Impact Survey on April 20-26, 2020, May 4-10, 2020, and May 30-June 8, 2020 from United States Dataset. A total number of 8790, 8975, and 7506 adults participated in this study for April, May and June, respectively. Participants' mental health evaluations were compared clinically by looking at the quantity and quality of their social ties before and during the pandemic using machine learning techniques. To predict relationships between COVID-19 mental health and demographic and social factors, we employed random forest, support vector machine, Naive Bayes, and logistic regression. The result for each contributing feature has been analyzed separately in detail. On the other hand, the influence of each feature was studied to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. The overall result of our research indicates that people who had previously been diagnosed with any type of mental illness were most affected by the new constraints during the pandemic. These people were among the most vulnerable due to the imposed changes in lifestyle. This study estimates the occurrence of mental illness among adults with and without a history of mental disease during the COVID-19 preventative limitations. With the persistence of quarantine limitations, the prevalence of psychiatric issues grew. In the third survey, which was done under quarantine or house restrictions, mental health problems and acute stress reactions were substantially greater than in the prior two surveys. The findings of the study reveal that more focused messaging and support are needed for those with a history of mental illness throughout the implementation of restrictions.","Sadegh-Zadeh, Bahrami, Najafi, Asgari-Ahi, Campion, Hajiyavand","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.933439","20220825","COVID-19 pandemic; machine learning; mental health; prediction model; psychiatry issues; social behaviours; statistic analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36558,""
"Children and Adolescents Psychological Distress Scale During COVID-19 Pandemic: Validation of a Psychometric Instrument (CONFEADO Study)","In March 2020, the WHO declared a pandemic (COVID-19) due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In France, school closures and lockdowns were implemented. In this unprecedented context for French adolescents and children, the CONFEADO study surveyed children aged 9 to 18 years to assess their mental health, psychological distress, and resilience during and after the lockdown in relation to their living and housing conditions. To assess psychological distress, a psychometric tool (Children and Adolescent Psychological Distress Scale-CAPDS-10) was specifically designed for the research. This article presents the psychometric validity of the CAPDS-10. This cross-sectional study collected data from June 9 to September 14, 2020, from children and adolescents (9 to 18 years of age) via an online questionnaire after sending it to a large network of partners. Psychological distress, resilience, and trait anxiety were assessed using the CAPDS-10, the Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM), and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). The CAPDS-10 measured perceived psychological distress in the most recent 2 weeks (primary endpoint). The predictive power of the CAPDS-10 was determined by statistical analysis. We proceeded to a confirmatory factor analysis to validate the scale at a clinical level. We carried out a psychometric validation with a step to verify the uni-dimensionality of the scale (PCA analysis) and the calculation of convergent and divergent validity, correlation coefficient between items and subscales, Cronbach's alpha for reliability, determination of a cut-off score for the AUROC index. Three thousand and forty eight children and adolescents completed the CAPDS-10. Analysis confirmed a three-factor model (anxiety, depression, and aggressive behavior) (RMSEA = 0.072 [0.067; 0.077], CFI = 0.954), with a correlation coefficient between items &gt;0.4. PCA analysis concluded that the scale is unidimensional. Reliability was satisfactory with Cronbach's alpha coefficients &gt;0.7 (0.86). In addition, prediction was good with an AUROC index equal to 0.73 and a threshold score for severe distress greater than or equal to 19. The CAPDS-10 measures psychological distress over the most recent 2-week period with good psychometric qualities. It could be used in crisis or prevention contexts in the general population or in clinical settings.","De Stefano, Laurent, Kaindje-Fondjo, Estevez, Habran, Falissard, Haag, Khireddine, D'Hont, Baubet, Oppenchaim, Vandentorren, Rezzoug","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.843104","20220825","COVID-19; adolescents; children; distress; mental health; psychometric; scale; validation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36559,""
"Psychotherapy and Follow-Up in Health Care Workers After the COVID-19 Epidemic: A Single Center's Experience","The present study aims to analysis the mental health of high-risk health care workers (HHCWs) and low-risk HCWs (LHCWs) who were respectively exposed to COVID-19 wards and non-COVID-19 wards by following up on mental disorders in HCWs in China for 6 months. A multi-psychological assessment questionnaire was used to follow up on the psychological status of HCWs in the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University in Xuzhou City (a non-core epidemic area) at 6 months after the first evaluation conducted during the COVID-19 epidemic. Based on the risk of exposure to COVID-19 patients, the HCWs were divided into two groups: high-risk HCWs, who worked in COVID-19 wards, and low-risk HCWs, who worked in non-COVID-19 wards. A total of 198 HCWs participated in the study, and 168 questionnaires were selected for evaluation. Among them, 93 (55.4%) were in the HHCW group and 75 (44.5%) were in the LHCW group. Significant differences were observed in salary, profession, and altruistic behavior between the two groups (P &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the anxiety, depression, insomnia, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) scores between the two groups. Logistic regression revealed that work stress was a major joint risk factor for mental disorders in HCWs. Among all the HCWs, a total of 58 voluntarily participated in psychotherapy; the analysis showed a significant decrease in anxiety, depression, PTSD, work stress, and work risk after attending psychotherapy. There were also significant differences in positive and negative coping styles before and after psychotherapy. In the present follow-up, work stress was the major contributing factor to mental disorders in HCWs. Psychotherapy is helpful in terms of stress management and should be provided to first-line COVID-19 HCWs.","Chen, Ma, Du, Huang, Zhu, Li, Geng, Xu","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S371787","20220825","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; insomnia; posttraumatic stress disorder; work stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36560,""

"Binge-eating behaviors in adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent public health measures have resulted in a worsening of eating disorder symptoms and an increase in psychological distress. The present study examined symptoms and behaviors in adolescents and young adults with emotional eating, bingeing behaviors and binge eating disorder during the pandemic. Additionally, the study explored if individuals who experienced pandemic-related food availability and food affordability issues experienced increased binge-eating symptoms and negative feelings. Participants (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39) were a convenience sample who participated between November 2020 and January 2021 in a weight and lifestyle management program at an urban New England pediatric hospital. Participants completed online surveys that assessed (1) participant's exposure to COVID-19 related stress and binge-eating behaviors using the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Survey-Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA) and the Binge Eating Scale (BES) respectively, (2) participants' and their families' ability to attain and afford food and its association with bingeing behaviors, and (3) the relationship between food availability and affordability and negative emotions. Nearly half of all participants (48.7%) reported moderate to severe bingeing during the COVID-19 pandemic; those who experienced greater COVID-related stress reported more binge-eating behaviors (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). There were no associations between indicators of food availability and affordability and binge eating or between food availability and affordability and negative feelings. Higher pandemic-related stress was associated with more binge-eating behaviors among adolescents and young adults. These results underscore the need to monitor symptoms and provide treatment for these patients despite barriers to care imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Research and clinical care for adolescents and young adults with EDs must recognize and respond to pandemic effects across the weight and disordered eating spectrum. Research shows that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have far-reaching adverse effects on mental health. For adolescents and young adults, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered critical aspects of their daily lives. The objective of this study is to investigate binge-eating behaviors in adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine if individuals in households that experienced pandemic-related challenges such as food availability and food affordability had greater increases in bingeing behaviors and negative emotions such as feelings of anxiety, worry, mood, and loneliness. Thirty-nine adolescents and young adults previously assessed in an outpatient weight and lifestyle management program at an urban pediatric hospital were surveyed between November 2020 and January 2021. Almost half (48.7%) of these participants reported moderate to severe bingeing behaviors during the pandemic. Participants who reported higher impact of COVID-related stress on the CEFIS-AYA scale reported the highest level of binge-eating behaviors. There were no associations between food availability and affordability and binge eating or between food availability and affordability and negative feelings. This study highlights the importance of assessing patientsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perception of how they experience the myriad impacts of COVID-19 on their daily lives, and the critical need for increases in accessible mental health services and continued support during the on-going pandemic.","Freizinger, Jhe, Dahlberg, Pluhar, Raffoul, Slater, Shrier","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00650-6","20220824","Adolescents; Binge eating disorder; Bingeing behaviors; COVID-19 pandemic; Eating disorders; Food affordability; Food availability; Young adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36562,""
"Emotional profiling and cognitive networks unravel how mainstream and alternative press framed AstraZeneca, Pfizer and COVID-19 vaccination campaigns","COVID-19 vaccines have been largely debated by the press. To understand how mainstream and alternative media debated vaccines, we introduce a paradigm reconstructing time-evolving narrative frames via cognitive networks and natural language processing. We study Italian news articles massively re-shared on Facebook/Twitter (up to 5 million times), covering 5745 vaccine-related news from 17 news outlets over 8 months. We find consistently high trust/anticipation and low disgust in the way mainstream sources framed ""vaccine/vaccino"". These emotions were crucially missing in alternative outlets. News titles from alternative sources framed ""AstraZeneca"" with sadness, absent in mainstream titles. Initially, mainstream news linked mostly ""Pfizer"" with side effects (e.g. ""allergy"", ""reaction"", ""fever""). With the temporary suspension of ""AstraZeneca"", negative associations shifted: Mainstream titles prominently linked ""AstraZeneca"" with side effects, while ""Pfizer"" underwent a positive valence shift, linked to its higher efficacy. Simultaneously, thrombosis and fearful conceptual associations entered the frame of vaccines, while death changed context, i.e. rather than hopefully preventing deaths, vaccines could be reported as potential causes of death, increasing fear. Our findings expose crucial aspects of the emotional narratives around COVID-19 vaccines adopted by the press, highlighting the need to understand how alternative and mainstream media report vaccination news.","Semeraro, Vilella, Ruffo, Stella","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-18472-6","20220824","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36563,""

"Experienced stigma and applied coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany: a mixed-methods study","Health-related stigma is considered a social determinant of health equity and a hidden burden of disease. This study aimed to assess the level and dimensions of stigma and respective coping mechanisms in COVID-19 survivors. A mixed-methods study with sequential explanatory design was conducted at the University Hospital of Ulm, Germany. Stigma was assessed using the Social Impact Scale (SIS) including adult COVID-19 survivors with mild-to-severe disease. Subsequently, 14 participants were sampled with regard to gender, age and severity of disease for in-depth interviews to understand how stigma was experienced and coping strategies were applied. The questionnaire was analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test and analysis of variance. Content analysis was used for qualitative data. From 61 participants, 58% were men and mean age was 51 years. The quantitative analysis of the SIS indicated an intermediate level of experienced stigma. Participants experienced stigma mainly as 'social rejection' (M=14.22, SD=4.91), followed by 'social isolation' (M=10.17, SD=4.16) and 'internalised shame' (M=8.39, SD=3.32). There was no significant difference in experienced stigma regarding gender, education, occupational status or residual symptoms. However, participants between 30 and 39 years of age experienced higher levels of stigma than other age groups (p=0.034). The qualitative analysis revealed how stigma seemed to arise from misconceptions creating irrational fear of infection, leading to stereotyping, vilification, discrimination and social exclusion of COVID-19 survivors, leaving them feeling vulnerable. Stigma cut through all social levels, from the individual level at the bottom to the institutional and societal level at the top. Social networks protected from experiencing stigma. COVID-19-related stigma is a relevant burden in the ongoing pandemic. Providing accurate information and exposing misinformation on disease prevention and treatment seems key to end COVID-19-related stigma.","Peters, Burkert, Brenner, GrÃƒÂ¼ner","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059472","20220824","COVID-19; mental health; social medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36565,""
"Changes in life satisfaction, depression, general health and sleep quality of Spanish older women during COVID-19 lockdown and their relationship with lifestyle: an observational follow-up study","To analyse the effects of COVID-19 lockdown on mental well-being variables of older women, and to determine the influence of lifestyle and age on such effects. The hypothesis of the study was that all parameters related to mental well-being would worsen in older women during the COVID-19 lockdown. Observational follow-up study. Pre lockdown measurements were taken before the lockdown. Post lockdown measurements were taken as soon as began the de-escalation. Senior centres in the Region of Murcia (Spain). The sample was composed of 40 older women volunteers, over 54 years of age (mean age=62.35Ã‚Â±8.15 years). Pre lockdown and post lockdown evaluations were carried out face to face. The following questionnaires were completed: Satisfaction with Life Scale, The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, The Short Form 36 Health Survey, The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire and Prevention with Mediterranean Diet. Post lockdown, a worsening was found in the variables of life satisfaction (p=0.001); depression (p&lt;0.001), quality of life in physical role (p=0.006), pain (p=0.004), emotional role (p&lt;0.001) and mental health (p&lt;0.001); and sleep quality (p=0.018), sleep latency (p=0.004), sleep disturbances (p=0.002) and global sleep quality score (p=0.002). It was found how age influenced the variables of pain (p=0.003) and social role (p=0.047), as well as the influence of a healthy lifestyle on the variables analysed (F=6.214; p=0.017). Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was shown to be a protective factor against increased depression (p=0.03). Spending time sitting was shown to be a risk factor for physical role health (p=0.002), as was advanced age on health due to worsening pain (p=0.005), or an unhealthy lifestyle on increased consumption of sleeping aids (p=0.017).

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and functional outcomes in Veterans with psychosis or recent homelessness: A 15-month longitudinal study","The COVID-19 pandemic has had unprecedented effects on mental health and community functioning. Negative effects related to disruption of individuals' social connections may have been more severe for those who had tenuous social connections prior to the pandemic. Veterans who have recently experienced homelessness (RHV) or have a psychotic disorder (PSY) are considered particularly vulnerable because many had poor social connections prior to the pandemic. We conducted a 15-month longitudinal study between May 2020 -July 2021 assessing clinical (e.g., depression, anxiety) and community (e.g., social functioning, work functioning) outcomes. Eighty-one PSY, 76 RHV, and 74 Veteran controls (CTL) were interviewed over 5 assessment periods. We assessed changes in mental health and community functioning trajectories relative to pre-pandemic retrospective ratings and examined group differences in these trajectories. All groups had significantly increased symptoms of depression, anxiety, and concerns with contamination at the onset of the pandemic. However, RHV and PSY showed faster returns to their baseline levels compared to CTL, who took nearly 15 months to return to baseline. With regards to functioning, both RHV and PSY, but not CTL, had significant improvements in family and social networks over time. Work functioning worsened over time only in PSY, and independent living increased over time in both RHV and PSY but not CTL. These results reveal that vulnerable Veterans with access to VA mental health and case management services exhibited lower negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and community functioning than expected.","Wynn, McCleery, Novacek, Reavis, Senturk, Sugar, Tsai, Green","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273579","20220825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36567,""
"Perception of risk regarding the use of COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant women in Motta town and Hulet Eji Enese district, northwest Ethiopia","COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is a common practice in developing countries like Ethiopia. Despite there being a rumor from the community that the use of COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy is associated with many pregnancy adverse outcomes. However, there is a paucity of empirical evidence on the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy in Ethiopia. This study assessed the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and associated factors in Motta town and Hulet Eji Enese district, northwest Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from December 12 to February 12, 2021. A total of 851 women' were selected using the stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semi-structured pretested and interviewer-administered questionnaire. A multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval at a p-value of Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05 was used to declare the level of significance. Perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was 34.2% (95%CI (Confidence Interval): 31-37). Unplanned pregnancy (AOR = 3.66; 95%CI: 2.31-5.81), long travel time to the nearby health care facility (AOR: 4.57; 95% CI: 2.34-8.91), have no formal education (AOR: 3.15; 95%CI: 1.71-5.79), attending secondary educational level (AOR: 5.18; 95% CI: 2.17-12.4), no ANC (Antenatal Care) service utilization (AOR: 7.07; 95% CI: 4.35-11.5) and negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (AOR: 6.05; 95%CI: 3.88-9.43) were significantly associated with the perception of risk COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy. Most of the participants perceive COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy as a risk for the outcome of pregnancy. Designing strategies to increase women's educational status, promoting the need for maternal and child health services, and awareness creation regarding COVID-19 vaccination will have a great role in changing the perception of pregnant women. Therefore, the government should design public health programs targeting the identified factor, and should minimize the perception of risk acquiring infection from COVID-19 vaccine to improve maternal and neonatal health outcome.","Asratie, Kassie, Belay, Endalew, Gashaw, Assegie","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0269591","20220825","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36568,""

"Effects of Wearing a Mask During Exercise on Physiological and Psychological Outcomes in Healthy Individuals: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Wearing face masks in public is an effective strategy for preventing the spread of viruses; however, it may negatively affect exercise responses. Therefore, this review aimed to explore the effects of wearing different types of face masks during exercise on various physiological and psychological outcomes in healthy individuals. A literature search was conducted using relevant electronic databases, including Medline, PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials on April 05, 2022. Studies examining the effect of mask wearing (surgical mask, cloth mask, and FFP2/N95 respirator) during exercise on various physiological and psychological parameters in apparently healthy individuals were included. For meta-analysis, a random effects model was used. Mean difference (MD) or standardized MD (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to analyze the total effect and the effect in subgroups classified based on face mask and exercise types. The quality of included studies was examined using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Forty-five studies with 1264 participants (708 men) were included in the systematic review. Face masks had significant effects on gas exchange when worn during exercise; this included differences in oxygen uptake (SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.66, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.87 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.45), end-tidal partial pressure of oxygen (MDÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.79Ã‚Â mmHg, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.46 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.12), carbon dioxide production (SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.77, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.15 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.39), and end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (MD 2.93Ã‚Â mmHg, 95% CI 2.01-3.86). While oxygen saturation (MDÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.48%, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.71 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.26) decreased slightly, heart rate was not affected. Mask wearing led to higher degrees of rating of perceived exertion, dyspnea, fatigue, and thermal sensation. Moreover, a small effect on exercise performance was observed in individuals wearing FFP2/N95 respirators (SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.42, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.76 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08) and total effect (SMDÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.23, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.41 toÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04). Wearing face masks during exercise modestly affected both physiological and psychological parameters, including gas exchange, pulmonary function, and subjective discomfort in healthy individuals, although the overall effect on exercise performance appeared to be small. This review provides updated information on optimizing exercise recommendations for the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Mental health and the effects on methylation of stress-related genes in front-line versus other health care professionals during the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic: an Italian pilot study","Healthcare workers experienced high degree of stress during COVID-19. Purpose of the present article is to compare mental health (depressive and Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorders-PTSD-symptoms) and epigenetics aspects (degree of methylation of stress-related genes) in front-line healthcare professionals versus healthcare working in non-COVID-19 wards. Sixty-eight healthcare workers were included in the study: 39 were working in COVID-19 wards (cases) and 29 in non-COVID wards (controls). From all participants, demographic and clinical information were collected by an ad-hoc questionnaire. Depressive and PTSD symptoms were evaluated by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively. Methylation analyses of 9 promoter/regulatory regions of genes known to be implicated in depression/PTSD (ADCYAP1, BDNF, CRHR1, DRD2, IGF2, LSD1/KDM1A, NR3C1, OXTR, SLC6A4) were performed on DNA from blood samples by the MassARRAY EpiTYPER platform, with MassCleave settings. Controls showed more frequent lifetime history of anxiety/depression with respect to cases (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.72, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). On the contrary, cases versus controls presented higher PHQ-9 (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.13, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04), PHQ-9 sleep item (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.26, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), IES-R total (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.17, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03), IES-R intrusion (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.46, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02), IES-R avoidance (tÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.99, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) mean total scores. Methylation levels at CRHR1, DRD2 and LSD1 genes was significantly higher in cases with respect to controls (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03, respectively). Frontline health professionals experienced more negative effects on mental health during COVID-19 pandemic than non-frontline healthcare workers. Methylation levels were increased in genes regulating HPA axis (CRHR1) and dopamine neurotransmission (DRD2 and LSD1), thus supporting the involvement of these biological processes in depression/PTSD and indicating that methylation of these genes can be modulated by stress conditions, such as working as healthcare front-line during COVID-19 pandemic.","Tabano, Tassi, Cannone, Brescia, Gaudioso, Ferrara, Colapietro, Fontana, Miozzo, Croci, Seia, Piuma, Solbiati, Tobaldini, Ferrero, Montano, Costantino, Buoli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01472-y","20220824","COVID-19; Epigenetics; Health professionals; Mental health; Stress-related genes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36571,""
"Prevalence and risk factors of self-reported psychotic experiences among high school and college students: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression","Adolescents are at high risk of incident psychopathology. Fleeting psychotic experiences (PEs) that emerge in young people in response to stress may be warning signs that are missed by research that fails to study stressed populations, such as late high school and college/university students. Our aim in this systematic review was to conduct a meta-analysis that estimates prevalence rates of PEs in students, and to assess whether these rates differ by gender, age, culture, and COVID-19 exposure. We searched nine electronic databases, from their inception until 31 January 2022 for relevant studies. We pooled the estimates using the DerSimonian-Laird technique and random-effects meta-analysis. Our main outcome was the prevalence of self-reported PEs in high school and college/university students. We subsequently analyzed our data by age, gender, population, country, culture, evaluation tool, and COVID-19 exposure. Out of 486 studies retrieved, a total of 59 independent studies met inclusion criteria reporting 210' 024 students from 21 different countries. Nearly one in four students (23.31%; 95% CI 18.41-29.05%), reported having experienced PEs (heterogeneity [Q=Ã¢â‚¬â€°22698.23 (62), pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001] Ãâ€ž<sup>2</sup> =1.4418 [1.0415; 2.1391], Ãâ€ž=1.2007 [1.0205; 1.4626], I<sup>2</sup> =99.7%, H=19.13 [18.59; 19.69]). The 95% prediction intervals were 04.01-68.85%. Subgroup analyses showed that the pooled prevalence differed significantly by population, culture, and COVID-19 exposure. This meta-analysis revealed a high prevalence rates of self-reported PEs among teen and young adult students, which may have significance for mental health screening in school settings.

"Mental health of female sex workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: stressors and coping strategies","The objective was to analyze the coping strategies adopted by female sex workers in the face of stressors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative study supported by Systems and Coping theories. An in-depth interview was carried out with 30 sex workers from the Alto SertÃƒÂ£o Produtivo Baiano between September and October 2020. The narratives were submitted to the resources of hermeneutics-dialectic to organize the categories. Four categories make reference to the system's stressors: negative feelings of fear, anxiety and difficulties in sleeping with the uncertainties in the face of the pandemic; concern about personal and family support; irritability in the face of conflicts; anxieties and insecurities with working conditions. Five categories allude to coping: strategies focused on the problem (pandemic); reframing and regulation of emotions; spirituality and religiosity; support networks and social support; use of medications. Stressors arise as a result of sexual service experiences combined with the pandemic situation with reduced customers and income, leading to the development of negative feelings and emotions. However, coping strategies are diverse and they women made effort to deal with problems and to balance their mental health.

By using the 2020 Living Profiles of Older People Survey in Seoul Metropolitan City and considering sociodemographic, health-related, social support, and isolation factors as independent variables, a logistic regression model was established. Among 3,106 samples, the overall rate of elder abuse was 8.5%, with emotional abuse being the most frequent. Social isolation (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.47, p =Ã‚Â .018) and recognition of abuse (ORÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.90, p =Ã‚Â .003) were associated with having experienced abuse. Seniors with a greater number of diseases, higher levels of dependency, depressive symptoms, and/or cognitive impairments were more likely to suffer abuse, as were those who smoked or drank alcohol.

"Molecular mechanisms and therapeutic target of NETosis in diseases","Evidence shows that neutrophils can protect the host against pathogens in multiple ways, including the formation and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NETs are web-like structures composed of fibers, DNA, histones, and various neutrophil granule proteins. NETs can capture and kill pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. The process of NET formation is called NETosis. According to whether they depend on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), NETosis can be divided into two categories: ""suicidal"" NETosis and ""vital"" NETosis. However, NET components, including neutrophil elastase, myeloperoxidase, and cell-free DNA, cause a proinflammatory response and potentially severe diseases. Compelling evidence indicates a link between NETs and the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including sepsis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, small-vessel vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, COVID-19, and others. Therefore, targeting the process and products of NETosis is critical for treating diseases linked with NETosis. Researchers have discovered that several NET inhibitors, such as toll-like receptor inhibitors and reactive oxygen species scavengers, can prevent uncontrolled NET development. This review summarizes the mechanism of NETosis, the receptors associated with NETosis, the pathology of NETosis-induced diseases, and NETosis-targeted therapy.","Huang, Hong, Wan, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.1002/mco2.162","20220824","NET inhibition; NETosis; neutrophil; neutrophil extracellular trap","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36577,""
"Perceived stress and its impact on the health behavior of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic: An Internet-based cross-sectional survey","The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe respiratory illnesses, following exposure to air-borne droplets or direct contact, posing a great threat to human life. This study aimed to investigate perceived stress and its correlation with the health behaviors of Chinese residents during the COVID-19 epidemic. An Internet survey was conducted among 2449 residents in 20 provinces of China on residents' perceived stress, perception of COVID-19, and health behaviors. SAS 9.4 was used to analyze the relationship between health behaviors and perceived stress, and logistic regression was used to explore the factors influencing health risk stress. The participants' perceived stress score was 22.25Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°7.2 (total 56), and the incidence of health risk stress was 39.89% (977/2449). Females, students, and medical staff were at high risk. Health risk stress refers to a level of stress that is hazardous to health (score over 25). Perceived stress increased, while the frequency of health behaviors decreased. Age, perception of susceptibility to COVID-19, life-threatening level of COVID-19, perception of the importance of home isolation, and perception of the difference between a common cold and COVID-19 were positively related to the occurrence of health risk stress. A negative correlation was found between health behaviors and perceived stress. Therefore, it is of great significance to provide psychological interventions for those who are experiencing health risk stress and to promote their health behaviors.","Yao, Xiong, Yuan, Luo, Yan, Li","https://doi.org/10.1002/hsr2.778","20220824","COVIDÃ¢â‚¬Â19; China; health behaviors; mental health; perceived stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36578,""
"Mental Health in Urologic Oncology","This article is a systematic review of mental health in urologic oncology patients with prostate cancer (PCa), bladder cancer (BC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), testicular cancer (TC), or penile cancer (PeCa). For all pathologies, a focus on increasing quality of life post-treatment demonstrated a positive impact in reducing Mental Health Illness (MHI) prevalence. Cancer specific mental health care may be given to patients to reduce suicide risk in BC patients and sexual identify and masculinity counseling may improve mental health for TC or PeCa patients. In order to better accommodate patient's mental health needs when undergoing GU cancer treatment, we recommend incorporation of mental health metrics such as questionnaires to assess early treatment of MHI, a greater emphasis on psychosocial support with the patient's loved ones, peers, and healthcare team, alongside advising healthy habits such as exercise which has been shown to drastically reduce MHI incidence across all pathologies. We hope that these measures conducted by urologists and oncologists, alongside possible coordination with psychiatrists and psychologists for psychotherapy, psychopharmacology, and neuro-stimulation treatment modems may be helpful in the long term to reduce MHI incidence in urology oncology patients. Given the higher incidence of MHI in oncology patients and in the patient population after the Covid-19 pandemic, MHI awareness in the sphere of urologic oncologic treatment continues to be crucial when creating a collaborative treatment platform for patients.","Anderson, Razzak, McDonald, Cao, Hasoon, Viswanath, Kaye, Urits","https://doi.org/10.52965/001c.37518","20220824","Anxiety; Bladder Cancer; Cancer; Depression; Mental Health; Prostate Cancer; Quality of Life; Urologic Oncology; Urology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36579,""
"Prevalence and associated factors of mental health outcomes among healthcare workers in Northern Colombia: A cross-sectional and multi-centre study","Mental health outcomes in Healthcare Workers (HCWs) has been few evaluated during COVID-19 pandemic in low-and middle-income countries. Our aim was carry-out a study to identify the prevalence of stress, anxiety, depression symptoms in HCWs and associated factors to severe illness in a northern region in Colombia. A cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted to assess mental health outcomes in 1,149 HCWs in Colombia. The study used Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to evaluate stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms, respectively. 682 HCWs completed the questionnaire. The 58,21% (397/682) were nurses, 31,23% were physicians (213/682), and 10,56% (72/682) were other health professionals. The proportion of HCWs with stress, anxiety, and depression symptoms were 59,97%, 44,87%, and 23,02%, respectively. HCWs in emergency room and Intensive Care Units (ICU) have 2-3-fold increase risk to have severe symptoms of stress. Staff in ICU have 64% more likely to have severe anxiety symptoms, and 97% more likely to have severe depression symptoms. Including HCWs only in the northern region in Colombia; a non-probabilistic sample, and a cross-sectional design to identify causality. A higher proportion on mental health outcomes has been reported in HCWs in Colombia. There are work areas related with severe mental symptoms such as ICU and emergency room. Hospitals and patient-care institutions in Latin-America needs consider the mental and physical health of HCWs during outbreaks and identify health staff at-risk to implementing support strategies to mitigate adverse mental outcomes.","Guillen-Burgos, Gomez-Ureche, Renowitzky, Acevedo-Vergara, Perez-Florez, Villalba, Escaf, Maloof, Torrenegra, Medina, Dau, Salva, Perez, Tapia, Salcedo, Maestre, Mattar, Parra-Saavedra, Torres, Mesino, Acosta, Mora, Vega, Galvez-Florez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2022.100415","20220824","Colombia; Healthcare workers; anxiety; depression; low-and-middle-income countries; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36580,""
"The mental health of healthcare workers in GCC countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review and meta-analysis","The aim of this study was to summarize the available evidence on the prevalence of stress, burnout, anxiety and depression among healthcare providers in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries (KSA, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates) during the COVID-19 pandemic. We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Google scholar for related studies published between January 2020 and April 2021 and conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. Of the 1815 identified studies, 29 met the inclusion criteria, and 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled estimate of prevalence for moderate to severe anxiety as reported using GAD-7 was 34.57% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 19.73%, 51.12%), that for moderate to severe depression using PHQ-9 was 53.12% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 32.76%, 72.96%), and that for moderate to severe stress using the 10-item Perceived Stress Scales was 81.12% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 72.15%, 88.70%). Meta-analysis was not performed for burnout due to the small number of identified studies and the different tools used; however, the highest prevalence was reported at 76% (95% CIÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 64%, 85%). Overall, a positive trend was observed over time for moderate to severe anxiety and depression, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.0059 and 0.0762, respectively. Of note, the heterogeneity was significant among the studies, and many studies were of poor quality. The prevalence of mental health disorders during the current pandemic among healthcare workers in GCC countries is high. However, the results could be affected by the high heterogeneity and low quality studies.

"Genetic predispositions to psychiatric disorders and the risk of COVID-19","Whether a genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders is associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is unknown. Our analytic sample consisted of 287,123 white British participants in UK Biobank who were alive on 31 January 2020. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis for each psychiatric disorder (substance misuse, depression, anxiety, psychotic disorder, and stress-related disorders) in a randomly selected half of the study population (""base dataset""). For the other half (""target dataset""), the polygenic risk score (PRS) was calculated as a proxy of individuals' genetic predisposition to a given psychiatric phenotype using discovered genetic variants from the base dataset. Ascertainment of COVID-19 was based on the Public Health England dataset, inpatient hospital data, or death registers in UK Biobank. COVID-19 cases from hospitalization records or death records were considered ""severe cases."" The association between the PRS for psychiatric disorders and COVID-19 risk was examined using logistic regression. We also repeated PRS analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. A total of 143,562 participants (including 10,868 COVID-19 cases) were used for PRS analyses. A higher genetic predisposition to psychiatric disorders was associated with an increased risk of any COVID-19 and severe COVID-19. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for any COVID-19 was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.13) and 1.06 (95% CI 1.01-1.11) among individuals with a high genetic risk (above the upper tertile of the PRS) for substance misuse and depression, respectively, compared with individuals with a low genetic risk (below the lower tertile). Slightly higher ORs were noted for severe COVID-19, and similar result patterns were obtained in analyses based on publicly available GWAS summary statistics. Our findings suggest a potential role of genetic factors in the observed phenotypic association between psychiatric disorders and COVID-19.

"Development of a ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" for adjustment of scissor blade separation and prevention of scissor blade damage during steam sterilization","Reprocess reusable surgical instruments during steam sterilization; damage occurs to sharp scissor blades in close position, so steam cannot reach the blades. Surgical instruments' management requires standards to ensure patient safety and prevent harmful pathogens, especially in the COVID-19 pandemic. Although various devices can separate scissor blades, they do not prevent damage to cutting edges. To address the above problem, we developed a new scissor protector, the ""Scissor-Tip-Separator,"" and evaluated its efficacy. The ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" design follows the steam sterilization guideline that instrument tips must be separated. The locking handles and V groove mechanism keep the scissor blades separated while preventing damage to the cutting edges. For efficacy assessment, purposive sampling was performed to select 44 Thai perioperative nurses at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, to evaluate the ""Scissor-Tip-Separators"" in 450 sterile instrument containers. All participants evaluated surgical scissors placed in the ""Scissor-Tip-Separators"" during instrument setup, following a problem record checklist. At the end of the fifth use, participants were asked to complete the ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" Effectiveness Scale, which was used to test the structural design of the ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" in terms of function, usability, and safety. The Adenosine Triphosphate surface test was also used to validate the ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" cleanliness. Data were collected from August 2020 to November 2020, then analyzed via descriptive statistics. The ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" met the cleaning validation criteria, and in 44 uses, the physical property remained the same. The scissor shank was discovered loose from the handle before it had been unlocked (0.2-0.4%) at the 45<sup>th</sup> use. Based on participants' opinions, the overall instrument effectiveness was high in terms of function, usability, and safety. The ""Scissor-Tip-Separator"" regulates scissor blade separation under sterilization guidelines; it prevents damage to cutting edges, thus ensuring patient safety. It protects against losses in a sterile field and can prevent hand injuries.","Chiannilkulchai, Bhumisirikul","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13037-022-00338-5","20220823","Scissor tip protector; Sharp protector; Sterilization; Surgical instruments; Tip protector","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36583,""
"Depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK","The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on mental health is still being unravelled. It is important to identify which individuals are at greatest risk of worsening symptoms. This study aimed to examine changes in depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms using prospective and retrospective symptom change assessments, and to find and examine the effect of key risk factors. Online questionnaires were administered to 34 465 individuals (aged 16 years or above) in April/May 2020 in the UK, recruited from existing cohorts or via social media. Around one-third (<i>n</i> = 12 718) of included participants had prior diagnoses of depression or anxiety and had completed pre-pandemic mental health assessments (between September 2018 and February 2020), allowing prospective investigation of symptom change. Prospective symptom analyses showed small decreases in depression (PHQ-9: -0.43 points) and anxiety [generalised anxiety disorder scale - 7 items (GAD)-7: -0.33 points] and increases in PTSD (PCL-6: 0.22 points). Conversely, retrospective symptom analyses demonstrated significant large increases (PHQ-9: 2.40; GAD-7 = 1.97), with 55% reported worsening mental health since the beginning of the pandemic on a global change rating. Across both prospective and retrospective measures of symptom change, worsening depression, anxiety and PTSD symptoms were associated with prior mental health diagnoses, female gender, young age and unemployed/student status. We highlight the effect of prior mental health diagnoses on worsening mental health during the pandemic and confirm previously reported sociodemographic risk factors. Discrepancies between prospective and retrospective measures of changes in mental health may be related to recall bias-related underestimation of prior symptom severity.","Young, Purves, HÃƒÂ¼bel, Davies, Thompson, Bristow, Krebs, Danese, Hirsch, Parsons, Vassos, Adey, Bright, Hegemann, Lee, Kalsi, Monssen, Mundy, Peel, Rayner, Rogers, Ter Kuile, Ward, York, Lin, Palmos, Schmidt, Veale, Nicholson, Pollak, Stevelink, Moukhtarian, Martineau, Holt, Maughan, Al-Chalabi, Chaudhuri, Richardson, Bradley, Chinnery, Kingston, Papadia, Stirrups, Linger, Hotopf, Eley, Breen","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0033291722002501","20220825","Anxiety; COVID-19; PTSD; depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-26","",36584,""
