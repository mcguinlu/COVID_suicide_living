"Predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Athens, Greece","Background: The epidemic of COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, with millions of confirmed cases and related deaths. Numerous efforts are being made to clarify how the infection progresses and potential factors associated with disease severity and mortality. We investigated the mortality in Greek hospitalized COVID-19 patients and also the predictors of this mortality. Methods: Study population included 512 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospitals of the Attica region of Greece. Patients demographic characteristics, comorbidities, allergies, previous vaccination for seasonal influenza virus, admission to ICU, intubation, and death were recorded. Potential predictors of in-hospital mortality were identified by regression analysis. Results: The mean age of hospitalized patients was 60.4 years, and was higher in patients who deceased. The most common comorbidities were respiratory diseases, hypertension, gastrointestinal disorders, dyslipidemia, mental health diseases, asthma, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. The need for ICU care and intubation was significantly higher among patients who died. The mortality rate was 15.8% (81 out of 512). Age [&ge;]65 years, cancer, chronic kidney disease, endocrine diseases, central nervous system disorders, anemia, and intubation were independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality, while allergies and previous influenza vaccination were associated with decreased in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Our finding of a beneficial effect of allergies and influenza vaccination against COVID-19 infection merits further investigation, as it may shed light in the mechanisms underlying disease progression and severity. Most importantly, it may assist in the implementation of efficient protective measures and public healthcare policies.","Dimitrios Giannoglou; Evangelia Meimeti; Xenia Provatopoulou; Kostantinos Stathopoulos; Kriton-Ioannis Roukas; Petros Galanis","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211193","20201014","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6001,""
"COVID-19 behavioural insights study: Preliminary findings from Finland, April-May, 2020","The COVID-19 monitoring behavioural insights study was conducted from April-May 2020 in Finland. Respondents reported feeling confident protecting themselves against COVID-19 infection. Worries shifted from overloading the health system (mean value 5.5 [95% CI: 5.4-5.6]) to mental health concerns (mean value 5.3 [95% CI 5.2-5.4]). Maintaining physical distancing from families and friends decreased by 7% and 6%. Respondents mostly agreed that if a vaccine would become available, they would get it.

"Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on People with Hypertension","Objectives: It is unclear how people with hypertension are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic given their increased risk, and whether targeted public health strategies are needed. Design: This retrospective case-control study compared people with hypertension to matched healthy controls during COVID-19 lockdown, to determine whether they have higher risk perceptions, anxiety and prevention intentions. Methods: Baseline data from a national survey were collected in April 2020 during COVID-19 lockdown. Of 4362 baseline participants, 466 people reported hypertension with no other chronic conditions, and were randomly matched to healthy controls with similar age, gender, education and health literacy. A subset (n=1369) was followed-up at 2 months after restrictions eased, including 147 participants with hypertension only. Risk perceptions, prevention intentions and anxiety were measured. Results: At baseline, perceived seriousness was high for both hypertension and control groups. The hypertension group had higher anxiety than controls; and were more willing to have the influenza vaccine. At follow-up, these differences were no longer present in the longitudinal sub-sample. Perceived seriousness and anxiety had decreased, but vaccine intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high (>80%). Conclusions: Anxiety was above normal levels during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was higher in the hypertension group, who also had higher vaccination intentions. Locations with prolonged restrictions may require targeted mental health screening for vulnerable groups. Despite a decrease in perceived risk and anxiety after 2 months of lockdown restrictions, vaccination intentions for both influenza and COVID-19 remained high, which is encouraging for future prevention of COVID-19.","Carissa Bonner; Erin Cvejic; Julie Ayre; Jennifer Isautier; Christopher Semsarian; Brooke Nickel; Carys Batcup; Kristen Pickles; Rachael Dodd; Samuel Cornell; Tessa Copp; Kirsten J McCaffery","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.20211722","20201014","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6003,""

"Debate: The impact of school closures and lockdown on mental health in young people","The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown response has had a disproportionate and damaging effect on the lives, mental health and well-being of young people globally. They have been neglected in policy-making and their needs have been subjugated to those of adults which contravenes the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Here, I argue that the needs and rights of young people must come first to protect their health, mental health and futures.

"Dynamics of psychological responses to COVID-19 in India: A longitudinal study","The novel COVID-19 pandemic has created chaos around the globe. To curb its spread, the Government of India announced a nationwide lockdown on March 24th, 2020 for 21 days, which was extended further for a longer time. This long period of lockdown disrupted the routine of all citizens, affecting their psychological well-being. While recent studies showed the psychological burden of Indians during the pandemic, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals adjusted for sociodemographic covariates showed that anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress (ÃŽÂ² = 0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Our findings suggested that while the lockdown may help in effectively addressing this pandemic, the state and society at large need to be sensitive to the mental health impacts of a long-drawn-out lockdown. Such effects likely have long-term sequelae. The disproportionate impact on women needs immediate attention. Moreover, it behooves society to address the root causes driving the unequal distribution of psychological distress during such crises.","Gopal, Sharma, Subramanyam","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0240650","20201013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6007,""
"Associations between COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief with COVID-19 knowledge and preventive behaviors: A cross-sectional online study","Online misinformation proliferation during the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health concern. We aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation exposure and belief, associated factors including psychological distress with misinformation exposure, and the associations between COVID-19 knowledge and number of preventive behaviors. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 1049 South Korean adults in April 2020. Respondents were asked about receiving COVID-19 misinformation using 12 items identified from the World Health Organization. Logistic regression was used to compute adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for the association of misinformation receipt with socio-demographic characteristics, source of information, COVID-19 misinformation belief and psychological distress, and the associations of COVID-19 misinformation belief with COVID-19 knowledge and the number of COVID-19 preventive behaviors among those who received the misinformation. All data were weighted according to the Korea census data in 2018. 67.78% respondents reported exposure to at least one COVID-19 misinformation item. Misinformation exposure was associated with younger age, higher education levels, and lower income. Sources of information associated with misinformation exposure were social networking services (aOR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.20-2.32) and instant messaging (1.79, 1.27-2.51) sources of information. Misinformation exposure was also associated with psychological distress including anxiety (1.80, 1.24-2.61), depressive (1.47, 1.09-2.00), and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (1.97, 1.42-2.73), as well as misinformation belief (7.33, 5.17-10.38). Misinformation belief was associated with poorer COVID-19 knowledge (High: 0.62, 0.45-0.84), and fewer preventive behaviors (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 7 behaviors: 0.54, 0.39-0.74). COVID-19 misinformation exposure was associated with misinformation belief, while misinformation belief was associated with fewer preventive behaviors. Given the potential of undermining global efforts in COVID-19 disease control, up-to-date public health strategies are required to counter proliferation of misinformation.","Lee, Kang, Wang, Zhao, Wong, O'Connor, Yang, Shin","https://doi.org/10.2196/22205","20201013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6008,""
"Priorities for addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college student mental health","The COVID-19 pandemic has already produced profound impacts on college students, with unprecedented directives for student relocation from their college campuses and dormitories mid-semester and coursework that took place through virtual learning. The current disruptions and anticipated potential long-term changes call for immediate prioritization regarding next steps for addressing college mental health and well-being. This viewpoint article highlights two urgent priorities for addressing current college mental health needs: the development of strategies for ensuring mental health service access, and intentional outreach to college students with special circumstances. The current crisis also represents an opportunity for campus administrators, mental health professionals, researchers, and policymakers to leverage innovative models of care as well as identity-related student assets, strengths, and resilience-promoting factors to support students' eventual return to campus and to respond more effectively to future massive disruptions.","Liu, Pinder-Amaker, Hahm, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1080/07448481.2020.1803882","20201013","COVID-19; mental health; stress; students; universities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6009,""
"Implications of COVID19-induced nation-wide lockdown on children's behavior in Punjab, India","Lockdown is one of the prevalent tools which are used to control the spread of COVID 19 virus in India. Under the circumstances created during lockdown period, children are deprived from the social interaction and companionship, because of which they are susceptible to psychiatric disorders. Therefore, in this study, efforts were to understand the impacts of lockdown on the mental status of the children of India and their specific causes. It is a questionnaire based study METHODS: A web based questionnaire was prepared and 400 parents from four districts of Punjab, India viz., Ludhiana, ShabizadaAjit Singh (SAS) Nagar, Sangrur and Ferozepur, were telephonically interviewed. Further, the information collected from the interviews were statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Findings from this study revealed that 73.15% and 51.25% of the children were having signs of increased irritation and anger, respectively. 18.7% and 17.6% of the parents also mentioned the symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively, among their children, which were also augmented by the changes in their diet, sleep, weight and more usage of the electronic equipment. Children (~76.3%) persistently urge to go outdoors and play with their friends, therefore, they could lag in social development. Further, observations from Pearson's correlation revealed that during lockdown children's mental health is significantly related to the area of their house, number of children in the family, qualification of their mother and socio-economic status of their family. This study made it evident that the mental health of the children residing in Punjab, India was compromised during the lockdown period induced by COVID 19 pandemic. Findings of this study may also trigger the international authorities to frame the guidelines of lockdown in the interest of mental health of their native children.","Sama, Kaur, Thind, Verma, Kaur, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1111/cch.12816","20201013","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6010,""
"Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth mental health among youth with physical health challenges","To examine mental health in conjunction with physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic among youth with physical health conditions compared to those without. A cross-sectional survey of 622 youth aged 14 to 28 was conducted. Analyses were conducted to understand the changes in mental and physical health among youth in four groups: (a) participants with a friend or family member diagnosed with COVID-19, (b) participants with symptoms associated with COVID-19, (c) participants with atopic conditions (asthma and allergies), and (d) participants with other preexisting physical health conditions. Many participants with physical health concerns met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder, which was significantly higher than the rate found among participants without physical health conditions. Significantly greater declines in self-reported mental health were observed during the COVID-19 period compared to 3 months earlier among youth reporting physical health concerns compared to those without physical health concerns. Substance use does not appear to have been affected. Mental health concerns are highly prevalent among youth with physical health concerns, and also appear to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical health concerns appear to constitute risk factors for heightened mental health responses to the pandemic situation. System planners striving to adapt mental health services to meet social/physical distancing recommendations are urged to consider youth with physical health conditions and ensure that adequate integrated mental health and physical health supports are available to them.","Hawke, Monga, Korczak, Hayes, Relihan, Darnay, Cleverley, Lunsky, Szatmari, Henderson","https://doi.org/10.1111/eip.13052","20201013","COVID-19; mental health; pandemic; physical health; substance use; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6011,""
"Risk for probable post-partum depression among women during the COVID-19 pandemic","The aim of the current study was to assess the risk for post-partum depression among women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic as compared to the risk among women delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic. A cohort study was performed among women delivering singletons at term which were recruited in the maternity wards of the Soroka University Medical Center. Recruitment was done during the COVID-19 strict isolation period (March 18 and April 29, 2020). Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the results were compared to women delivering at the same medical center before the COVID-19 pandemic. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to control for potential confounders. A total of 223 women who delivered during the COVID-19 strict isolation period were recruited. Women delivering during the COVID-19 pandemic had lower risk of having a high (&gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°10) or very high (Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°13) EPDS score as compared with women delivering before the COVID-19 pandemic (16.7% vs 31.3%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.002, and 6.8% vs 15.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.014, for EPDS Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 and EPDS Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°13, respectively).

"Prevalence of post-traumatic symptomatology and anxiety among residential nursing and care home workers following the first COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy","The current COVID-19 pandemic has been officially linked to the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people across the globe in just a few months. It is particularly lethal for the elderly in general, as well as for populations residing in long-term stay facilities. By this time, those working and caring for high-risk populations have been exposed to very intense and sudden levels of physical and psychological strain. The situation has taken a particularly tragic turn in residential nursing and care homes (NCH), which were hit hard by the pandemic. In residential NCH, neither residents nor workers tend to have immediate access to the same expertise, medication and equipment as in hospitals, which exacerbates an already tense situation. Among the mental health conditions related to exposure to potentially traumatic events, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety are the most prevalent and scientifically recognized. In this survey-based epidemiological study, we test the prevalence of anxiety and post-traumatic symptomatology in residential nursing and care home workers-a group of individuals that has been largely neglected but who nonetheless plays a very important and sensitive role in our society. We do this by focusing on the North of Italy, the most affected region during the first COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Using a single-stage cluster design, our study returns an estimate for the prevalence of moderate-to-severe anxiety and/or post-traumatic symptomatology of 43% (s.e. = 3.09; 95% CI [37-49]), with an 18% (s.e. = 1.83; 95% CI [14-22]) prevalence of comorbidity among workers of Northern Italian NCH between 15 June and 25 July 2020 (i.e. 12-52 days after the end of national lockdown). Women and workers who had recently been in contact with COVID-19-positive patients/colleagues are more likely to report moderate-to-severe symptoms, with odds ratios of 2.2 and 1.7, respectively.","Riello, Purgato, Bove, MacTaggart, Rusconi","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.200880","20201013","COVID-19; anxiety; care home worker; mental health; nursing home worker; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6013,""
"Vascular Events, Vascular Disease and Vascular Risk Factors-Strongly Intertwined with COVID-19","To elucidate the intertwining of vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors and COVID-19. Strokes are a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Vascular risk factors are important drivers of strokes. There are unmodifiable vascular risk factors such as age and ethnicity and modifiable vascular risk factors. According to the INTERSTROKE study, the 10 most frequent modifiable vascular risk factors are arterial hypertension, physical inactivity, overweight, dyslipidaemia, smoking, unhealthy diet, cardiac pathologies, diabetes mellitus, stress/depression and overconsumption of alcohol. Also, infection and inflammation have been shown to increase the risk of stroke. There is high-quality evidence for the clinical benefits of optimal primary and secondary stroke prevention. The COVID-19 pandemic brought a new perspective to this field. Vascular events, vascular disease and vascular risk factors-and COVID-19-are strongly intertwined. An increased risk of vascular events-by multifactorial mechanisms-has been observed in COVID-19 patients. Also, a higher rate of infection with COVID-19, severe COVID-19 and bad outcome has been demonstrated in patients with pre-existing vascular disease and vascular risk factors. At present, we suggest that regular interactions between healthcare professionals and patients should include education on COVID-19 and on primary and secondary vascular prevention in order to reduce the burden of disease in our ageing populations.","Scutelnic, Heldner","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11940-020-00648-y","20201013","COVID-19; Ischaemic stroke; Prevention; Vascular events; Vascular risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6014,""
"The psychological impact of COVID-19 outbreak on medical staff and the general public","To assess the psychological effects of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on medical staff and the general public. During the outbreak of COVID-19, an internet-based questionnaire included The Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the impact of the pandemic situation on the mental health of medical staff and general population in Wuhan and its surrounding areas. Among the 1493 questionnaires completed, 827 (55.39%) of these were men, and 422 (28.27%) of these were medical personnel. The results suggest that the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected individuals significantly, the degree of which is related to age, sex, occupation and mental illness. There was a significant difference in PSS-10 and IES-R scores between the medical staff and the general population. The medical staff showed higher PSS-10 scores (16.813Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.87) and IES-R scores (22.40Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.12) compared to members of the general population PSS-10 (14.80Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.60) and IES-R scores (17.89Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.08).

"Economic hardship and mental health complaints during COVID-19","The COVID-19 economic crash is idiosyncratic because of its virtual standstill of economic activity. We therefore ask how individual labor market experiences are related to the development of mental health complaints in the spring of 2020. As clinical data collection was compromised during the lockdowns, standardized surveys of the European labor force provide an opportunity to observe mental health complaints as the crisis unfolded. Data are representative of active members of the labor force of six European nations that contained varying levels of COVID-19 burdens in terms of mortality and lockdown measures. We document a steep occupational prestige level gradient on the probability of facing economic hardship during the lockdowns-looming job loss, income loss, and workload decline-which evidently exacerbate socioeconomic inequalities. Analyses indicate a striking positive relationship between instantaneous economic hardships during the COVID-19 lockdown and expressing feelings of depression and health anxiety. Importantly, the magnitude of the association between such hardships and indicators of mental health deterioration is highly dependent on workers' occupational standing, revealing a second layer of exacerbating inequality.","Witteveen, Velthorst","https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2009609117","20201013","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; health anxiety; labor market inequality; recession","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-14","",6016,""
