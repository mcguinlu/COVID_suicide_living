"High risk of patient self-inflicted lung injury in COVID-19 with frequently encountered spontaneous breathing patterns: a computational modelling study","There is ongoing controversy regarding the potential for increased respiratory effort to generate patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI) in spontaneously breathing patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory failure. However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%). Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min. Mechanical power increased from 7.83 J/min to 17.7 J/min at VT/RR of 7 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min, and to 240.5 7 J/min at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Our results suggest that the forces generated during increased inspiratory effort in severe COVID-19 are compatible with the development of P-SILI. If conventional oxygen therapy or non-invasive ventilation is ineffective in reducing respiratory effort, control of driving and transpulmonary pressures with invasive ventilation may reduce the risk of P-SILI and allow time for the resolution of the underlying condition.","Anup Das; Liam Weaver; Sina Saffaran; Nadir Yehya; Timothy E.

"Navigating COVID-19: Insights from research on social ostracism","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing and lockdowns has caused unprecedented changes to social life  We consider the possible implications of these changes for mental health  Drawing from research on social ostracism emphasizing the importance of social connection for mental well-being, there is reason for concern regarding the mental health effects of the crisis  However, there are also reasons for optimism;people can be surprisingly resilient to stressful situations, the impact of ostracism tends to depend on social norms (which are rapidly changing), and mental health depends primarily on having at least one or two close social connections  Given the scale and unprecedented nature of the social disruption that occurred, we see strong reason for concern, but not despair  Â© The Author(s) 2020","Hales, A.

"Learning as an Important Privilege: A Life Span Perspective with Implications for Successful Aging","Research has demonstrated the cognitive and mental health benefits of learning new skills and content across the life span, enhancing knowledge as well as cognitive performance  We argue that the importance of this learning-which is not available equally to all-goes beyond the cognitive and mental health benefits  Learning is important for not only the maintenance, but also enhancement of functional independence in a dynamic environment, such as changes induced by the COVID-19 pandemic and technological advances  Learning difficult skills and content is a privilege because the opportunities for learning are neither guaranteed nor universal, and it requires personal and social engagement, time, motivation, and societal support  This paper highlights the importance of considering learning new skills and content as an important privilege across the life span and argues that this privilege becomes increasingly exclusionary as individuals age, when social and infrastructural support for learning decreases  We highlight research on the potential positive and negative impacts of retirement, when accessibility to learning opportunities may vary, and research on learning barriers due to low expectations and limited resources from poverty  We conclude that addressing barriers to lifelong learning would advance theories on life span cognitive development and raise the bar for successful aging  In doing so, our society might imagine and achieve previously unrealized gains in life span cognitive development, through late adulthood  Â© 2021","Wu, R.; Zhao, J.; Cheung, C.; Natsuaki, M.

"Sino-Western rivalry in the COVID-19 â€œvaccine warsâ€â€“A race to the bottom?","Purpose: This paper analyses the escalating Sino-Western race to develop a safe, efficacious and durable vaccine (i e  â€œGoldilocks COVID-19 vaccineâ€)  It argues that such efforts would be considerably more effective if there is greater international cooperation instead of the corrosive rivalry driven by misplaced nationalism  Design/methodology/approach: This study deploys a case-study approach, supported by literature on existing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine development efforts  Findings: Despite the seeming success of recent COVID-19 vaccines, their actual efficacy is far from certain  Moreover, access to these vaccines would not be equitable internationally  This problem is exacerbated by the fact that their unique properties make storage and distribution prohibitively expensive, and international mechanisms to provide distribution to economically depressed regions are non-existent  Given the significant difficulties, it would be incumbent upon the great powers (i e  China and America) to work together not only in vaccine development but also in the establishment of a distribution platform to ensure equitable access worldwide  Originality/value: This study is one of the few social science research papers on COVID-19 vaccine development and its implications for society at large  Â© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Wong, W.

"Impact of COVID-19 social media news on employee behavior: the mediating role of psychological well-being and depression","Purpose: The study's objective is to examine the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social media news (SMN) on work boredom (WB) and task performance (TP)  The study proposes that psychological well-being (PWB) and depression mediate the relationship between COVID-19 SMN, WB and TP  Design/methodology/approach: The data for this research was collected from white-collar employees of two Asian countries, Pakistan (study 1, nÂ =Â 167) and Malaysia (study 2, nÂ =Â 118), was collected using an online survey during strict movement control order (MCO), work from home, at the beginning of the year 2020  Findings: In both studies, the PWB of employees mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and their WB  On the other hand, depression only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and WB in Pakistan  PWB only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and TP in study 2  Depression only mediated the relationship between COVID-19 SMN and TP in study 1  Research limitations/implications: A couple of limitations worth noting are that the study adopted a cross-sectional approach  Thus, the sample size is not large in both counties  Because of the outbreak, limited employees agree to be part of an online survey  The scope of the study also restricts the authors to collect data during MCO, when employees were forced to work from home  In Pakistan, MCO began on 20th March and ended on 30th April, while in Malaysia, MCO started on 18th March and ended on 12th May  This also limits the study's claim of generalizability  Practical implications: The practical implication of the study is to guide practitioners of both Pakistan and Malaysia in developing strategies that help them understand that employees having PWB look for growth and challenging opportunities even during pandemic situations;employers can leverage it to deal with external threats like COVID-19 because improving the PWB can improve TP and reduce WB  The interesting results highlighted the fact that high TP not necessarily means everything is fine with employees, when the uncertainty level is high, employees may be performing well due to fear and depression instead of work motivation  Thus, employers should be more vigilant during a pandemic situation  This study also helps policymakers understand that the overall economic situation affects the individual employeeâ€™s state of mind and work behavior  Originality/value: The paper contributes to scare literature on COVID-19 and SMN and illustrates employees' work behavior when forced to work from home during the MCO  Â© 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited","Anwar, A.; Kee, D.

"Practical guidelines for online Narrative Exposure Therapy (e-NET)â€“a short-term treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder adapted for remote delivery","Background: Online therapy has become increasingly desirable and available in recent years, with the current COVID-19 pandemic acting as a catalyst to develop further protocols enabling therapists to conduct online treatment safely and efficaciously  Offering online treatment potentially means that treatments are available to clients who would otherwise have no access, closing the gap in the provision of mental health services worldwide  Objective: This paper focuses on practical guidelines using online Narrative Exposure Therapy (e-NET)  It aims to be an addition to the general manual of NET to enable therapists to deliver online treatment  The face-to-face version of NET is a well-known short-term and evidence-based treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder;e-NET is currently being tested in several additional trials  Methods: The differences between NET and e-NET are elaborated and depicted in detail  Results: Difficulties encountered in e-NET delivery, e g  confidentiality, dealing with interruptions, comorbid symptoms among others, are similar to those that occur during face to face interventions but the solutions have to be adapted  Dissociation is often regarded as a challenge in face-to-face treatment, and requires particular attention within the online setting  Therefore, tools for addressing dissociation in this particular setting are presented  Conclusions: These practical guidelines show the advantages as well as the challenges therapists face when conducting e-NET  They aim to empower therapists working with trauma clients to conduct e-NET confidently and safely  Â© 2021 The Author(s)  Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group","Kaltenbach, E.; McGrath, P.

"Detecting Topic and Sentiment Dynamics Due to COVID-19 Pandemic Using Social Media","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) has greatly influenced peopleâ€™s daily lives across the globe  Emergent measures and policies (e g , lockdown, social distancing) have been taken by governments to combat this highly infectious disease  However, peopleâ€™s mental health is also at risk due to the long-time strict social isolation rules  Hence, monitoring peopleâ€™s mental health across various events and topics will be extremely necessary for policy makers to make the appropriate decisions  On the other hand, social media have been widely used as an outlet for people to publish and share their personal opinions and feelings  The large scale social media posts (e g , tweets) provide an ideal data source to infer the mental health for people during this pandemic period  In this work, we propose a novel framework to analyze the topic and sentiment dynamics due to COVID-19 from the massive social media posts  Based on a collection of 13 million tweets related to COVID-19 over two weeks, we found that the positive sentiment shows higher ratio than the negative sentiment during the study period  When zooming into the topic-level analysis, we find that different aspects of COVID-19 have been constantly discussed and show comparable sentiment polarities  Some topics like â€œstay safe homeâ€ are dominated with positive sentiment  The others such as â€œpeople deathâ€ are consistently showing negative sentiment  Overall, the proposed framework shows insightful findings based on the analysis of the topic-level sentiment dynamics  Â© 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG","Yin, H.; Yang, S.; Li, J.","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65390-3_46","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Lect.

"Effect of climate change on health in Pakistan Mohammad","Climate change has emerged as a global issue that poses a serious threat to life in this world such as a shortage of food and clean drinking water due to global warming, erratic weather patterns, melting glaciers, droughts, etc  This issue has been in the limelight for more than 4 decades and world bodies including the WHO have been quite active in holding international conferences, seminars, and workshops to impress upon the member countries to take concrete steps to mitigate environmental degradation and save future generations from the devastating effects of climate change  While the climate change issue has been highlighted to a great extent, its impact on health has not received appreciable attention of the world community  The initiative of Inter-Academy Partnership (IAP) to address this issue is, therefore, a laudable scientific endeavor  Pakistan, one of the developing countries in South Asia is among the 5 most-affected countries due to climate change  Climate change has resulted in erratic weather patterns, reduction in the availability of clean water per capita, melting of glaciers, desertification of fertile cultivable land, flooding, land sliding, and drought leading to food insecurity  Besides having a drastic effect on the economy, the health of people is also getting adversely affected  According to the United Nations, more than 44% of Pakistani children under the age of 5 years suffer from stunted growth due to malnutrition  Such stunting impairs normal brain and body development  This has been one of the most alarming consequences of poverty and food insecurity  Other ill-effects of climate change (such as unseasonal rains and â€œsmogâ€) on health include the spread of water and vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, zika virus, typhoid, cholera, asthma, hay fever, allergies, respiratory diseases, and chronic diseases like diabetes, cardiovascular disease, renal disease, obesity, cancers, anxiety, and depression  Moreover, infectious diseases such as hepatitis B and C, COVID-19 are also spreading due to a compromised immune system  It is hoped that the world during the post-pandemic period would be more conscious of the mitigation steps to be taken to prevent future generations from the ill-effects of climate change  The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres in his recently enunciated guiding principles urged the world leaders in the post-pandemic period â€œto rescue businesses that can create new jobs and enterprises through a clean and green transition based on the decarbonization of the economy and shift fiscal power from grey to green to initiate the resilience of people and communities in a way that is fair and leaves no one behindâ€  In other words, the world needs a â€œclimate-smartâ€ stimulus to provide a safe and healthy environment to future generations  Â© Pakistan Academy of Sciences","Iqbal, P.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+climate+change+on+health+in+Pakistan+Mohammad","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Proceedings of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences: Part B;57(3):1-12, 2021.; Publication details: Proceedings of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences: Part B;57(3):1-12, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12080,""

"Continuity of care in a psychiatric Day Hospital during the COVID-19 emergency Transformations of therapeutic models between crisis and change","Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged our treatment models, leading our team to rethink and share strategies of care, in order to ensure the continuity of therapeutic relationships during the precarious context of the pandemic  Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and perceived efficacy of a remote therapeutic intervention in the treatment of patients in a psychiatric Day Hospital (DH)  Methods: A group of 48 children and adolescents (64 6% female, age from 9 to 19 years, mean age 15 2 years and SD 2 50), already in treatment for severe and complex psychopathology at the psychiatric-therapeutic DH of the Child Neuropsychiatry Service of the Regina Margherita Hospital of Turin prior to the COVID-19 emergency, received remotely a multidisciplinary intervention for 90 days, with maintenance of the weekly / multi-weekly therapeutic session and additional contacts based on individual needs  Patients were prospectively assessed, at the lockdown onset (T0) and after 30 (T1), 60 (T2) and 90 days (T3), with clinical evaluation of the overall severity of psychopathology using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity scales (CGI-S) and -Improvement (CGI-I) and monitoring suicidal ideation or behavior, non-suicidal self-harm (NSSI) and social withdrawal  Patients and parents were asked to indicate on a Likert scale the perceived usefulness of the telemedicine interventions  Data were analyzed with non-parametric tests and an ordinal logistic regression analysis was performed  Results: An average of 5 4 remote interventions per patient per week (min: 2, max: 9) were provided, without any complete drop-out  During the 90 days of the intervention, no suicide attempt was recorded  Three patients (6 2%), were hospitalized  CGI-S scores indicated a significant reduction in the severity of illness between T0 and T3 (p = 0 03), with improvement in 45 8% of patients, worsening in 25%, and no change in the remaining 29 2%  Clinical improvement was more evident among patients without social withdrawal than in those with social withdrawal (p 0 04)  Suicidal thoughts were reported by 35 4% of the participants at T0 and 20 8% at T3  Based on information from patients, parents and educators, NSSI was present in 22 9% at T0 and in 12 5% at T3 (p = 0 063)  Of the patients with NSSI at T0, 45 4% showed a reduction of self-injury  There were no newly reported cases of NSSI during the 90 days of intervention  Individual NPI visits were rated from moderately to extremely useful by 92 3% of the patients, and 82% of the parents rated from moderately to extremely useful NPI visits, psychotherapy sessions and teaching  Conclusions: The remote intervention during the lockdown period COVID-19 was feasible, well accepted by patients and parents and accompanied by indicators of improvement, despite the necessary suspension of in person DH treatments  It is conceivable to hypothesize that the continuity of care through telemedicine and the flexibility of the multidisciplinary model helped patients maintain the therapeutic alliance  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (Italian) Introduzione: La pandemia da COVID-19 ha messo alla prova i nostri modelli di cura lanciando nello stesso tempo una sfida: ripensarli e condividerli, per garantire continuita di relazione terapeutica pur in un contesto di emergenza e precarieta  Obiettivo: Valutare la fattibilita e efficacia percepita di un intervento terapeutico da remoto nel trattamento di pazienti in un Day Hospital psichiatrico (DH)  Metodi: Un gruppo di 48 bambini e adolescenti (64,6% di sesso femminile, eta da 9 a 19 anni, eta media 15,2 e DS 2,50), gia in trattamento per psicopatologia grave e complessa presso il DH psichiatrico-terapeutico del Servizio di Neuropsichiatria Infantile dell'Ospedale Regina Margherita di Torino nel periodo precedente all'emergenza sanitaria, hanno ricevuto un intervento multidisciplinare da remoto per 90 giorni: mantenimento dei setting terapeutici settimanali/plurisettimanali e contatti in urgenza in base ai bisogni individuali dei pa ienti  I pazienti sono stati seguiti nel tempo, prima dell'intervento (T0) e dopo 30 (T1), 60 (T2), e 90 giorni (T3), con valutazione clinica della gravita complessiva della psicopatologia mediante le scale Clinical Global Impressions-Severity (CGI-S) e -Improvement (CGI-I) e monitoraggio di possibile ideazione o comportamento suicidari, autolesionismo non suicidario (NSSI), e ritiro sociale  A pazienti e genitori e stato chiesto di indicare su scala Likert l'utilita percepita degli interventi erogati in modalita telematica  I dati sono stati analizzati con test non parametrici ed e stata effettuata un'analisi di regressione logistica ordinale  Risultati: Gli interventi erogati a distanza sono stati in media 5,4 per paziente per settimana (min: 2;max: 9)  Nessun paziente ha abbandonato il trattamento  Non si sono verificati drop out completi rispetto alla presa in carico  Non si sono verificati tentativi di suicidio  Per 3 pazienti (6 2%) si e reso necessario programmare un ricovero  La CGI-S ha indicato una significativa riduzione della severita del quadro clinico (p = 0,03), con un miglioramento nel 45,8% dei pazienti, una stazionarieta nel 29,2% e peggioramento nel 25%  Il miglioramento clinico si e reso piu evidente nel gruppo di pazienti senza ritiro sociale rispetto al gruppo di pazienti con ritiro sociale (p = 0,04)  Ideazione suicidaria era presente nel 35,4% dei pazienti a T0 e nel 20,8% a T3  Sulla base delle dichiarazioni dei pazienti, dei genitori e degli educatori, i pazienti con NSSI a T0 erano il 22,9% e a T3 il 12,5% (p = 0,063)  Tra i pazienti con NSSI a T0 si e riscontrata una riduzione del NSSI a T3  Non si sono registrati nuovi casi di NSSI  Le visite NPI sono state valutate da moderatamente a estremamente utili dal 92,3% dei pazienti e l'82% dei genitori ha valutato da moderatamente a estremamente utili le visite NPI, le sedute di psicoterapia e la didattica a distanza  Conclusioni: L'intervento a distanza durante il periodo di lockdown COVID-19 si e dimostrato fattibile, ben accettato da pazienti e genitori, e accompagnato da indici di miglioramento, nonostante la necessaria sospensione dei trattamenti in presenza  E ipotizzabile che la continuita del trattamento e la flessibilita del modello multidisciplinare, anche in

"Consideraciones sobre la salud mental en la pandemia de COVID-19","Since December 2019, 414,179 cases of people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have been reported. As a result of the rapid increase in confirmed cases and deaths, population and health personnel, have experienced psychological problems, such as anxiety, depression, and stress. Although scientific information on COVID-19 is constantly increasing, it mainly focuses on genetic, epidemiological aspects, and public health measures, leaving aside possible effects on mental health. In order to summarize the current evidence, we present a narrative review of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. So far, the presence of anxiety, depression, and stress has been reported mostly in general population. Nonetheless, mental health issues have also been reported in health care workers, especially among female professionals, nurses, and those who work directly with suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. In efforts to reduce the spread of the disease, attention should be paid to the diagnosis and treatment of mental health issues. We believe that addressing them adequately will empower Peru to contain and eradicate COVID-19.","Huarcaya-Victoria, Jeff","https://dx.doi.org/10.17843/rpmesp.2020.372.5419","","Country: PE; PERU; PERU; PERU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica;37(2): 327-334, 2020.; Publication details: Rev Peru Med Exp Salud Publica;37(2): 327-334, 2020.; Coronavirus Infections/psychology; Health Personnel/psychology; Mental Health; Pneumonia, Viral/psychology; Anxiety/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/prevention & control; Depression/epidemiology; Humans; Pandemics/prevention & control; Peru/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Pneumonia, Viral/prevention & control; Stress, Psychological/epidemiology; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12089,""

A total of 1172 (683 female and 489 male) children and adolescents aged 8-18Â years were involved in completing the measurements of PTSD, GAD, perceived threat of COVID-19, and COVID-19-related courtesy stigma. The Latent Profile Analysis identified the three profiles of the symptoms for PTSD and GAD which were labeled as Moderate PTSD, Mild Comorbidity, and Severe Comorbidity. The scores of the symptoms for PTSD, GAD, perceived threat, and stigma were different among the three profiles. The risk factors (i.e., perceived threat and stigma) that are related to comorbidity patterns were examined through a three-step method. The possibility of entry into the Severe Comorbidity Profile increased with increasing perceived threat and stigma. The mental health care interventions for children and adolescents who are susceptible to COVID-19 can be developed to reduce perceived threat and stigma.","Li, Yumei; Duan, Wenjie; Chen, Zheng","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2020.105235","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;116: 105235, 2020 Sep.; Publication details: Child Youth Serv Rev;116: 105235, 2020 Sep.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12090,""
"Italian Nurses' experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative analysis of internet posts","To investigate the experience of Italian nurses during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak by analysing professional social media posts. The COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed health care institutions; as a consequence, nurses' lives and psycho-physical health have been affected. The COVID-19 pandemic forced nurses to work in physically and psychologically stressful conditions impacting on their life. A qualitative descriptive study. All narratives (texts and videos) posted by nurses from the 23<sup>rd</sup> of February 2020 to the 3<sup>rd</sup> of May (from the start of the outbreak to the end of the first lockdown) were analysed and published on the five most popular Italian professional social media platforms. The Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative research guidelines were followed. Five themes emerged from the 380 narratives explored: 'Sharing what is happening within myself'; 'Experiencing unprecedented working conditions'; 'Experiencing a deep change'; 'Failing to rehabilitate the image of nurses in society'; and 'Do not abandon us'. Even though nurses appreciated the recognition of their communities, they still felt devalued and not recognized as professionals. Several psychological, physical, social and professional implications emerged from nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite being highly praised, nurses perceived they had failed in rehabilitating the image of nurses in society. The experience of working during the COVID-19 pandemic represented a traumatic event for nurses but it offered them personal and professional growth opportunities. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE, NURSING POLICY AND HEALTH POLICY: Supporting nurses' mental health is highly recommended, together with a cultural investment on nurses' role recognition, and a zero-tolerance policy towards violence and aggression towards nurses.","Fontanini, Visintini, Rossettini, Caruzzo, Longhini, Palese","https://doi.org/10.1111/inr.12669","20210317","COVID-19; Experience; Mental health; Nurses; Nursing practice; Public image; Social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12091,""
"Impacts of anxiety and socioeconomic factors on mental health in the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in the general population in Japan: A web-based survey","Owing to the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic worldwide, individuals experience considerable psychological distress daily. The present study aimed to clarify the prevalence of psychological distress and determine the population most affected by risk factors such as the pandemic, socioeconomic status (SES), and lifestyle-related factors causing psychological distress in the early phases of the pandemic in Japan. This study was conducted via a web-based survey using quota sampling to ensure representativeness of the Japanese population aged 20-64 years. A cross-sectional study of 11,342 participants (5,734 males and 5,608 females) was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire that included the Japanese version of the Kessler 6 Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and questions related to the pandemic, SES, and lifestyle. The prevalence of psychological distress, represented by a K6 score of 5 or more, was 50.3% among males and 52.6% among females. Both males and females with annual household incomes less than 2 million yen and males aged in their twenties had significantly higher K6 scores than those with annual household incomes above 2 million yen and males aged over 30 years. Binary logistic regression analyses found pandemic-related factors such as medical history, inability to undergo clinical tests immediately, having trouble in daily life, unavailability of groceries, new work style, and vague anxiety; SES-related factors such as lesser income; and lifestyle-related factors such as insufficient rest, sleep, and nutritious meals to be significantly related to psychological distress. Psychological distress was more prevalent among people with low income and in younger generations than among other groups. There is an urgent need to provide financial, medical, and social support to those affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.","Nagasu, Muto, Yamamoto","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0247705","20210317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12092,""

Healing Hearts Together (HHT) is an 8-week couples-based intervention designed to improve relationship quality, mental health, quality of life, and cardiovascular health among couples in which one partner has experienced a cardiac event. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) began in October 2019 to test the efficacy of the in-person, group-based HHT program as compared to usual care. In March of 2020, all recruitment, assessments, and interventions halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by optimal virtual care principles, and Hom and colleagues' (2020) four-stage framework (consultation, adaptation, pilot testing, and test launch), this paper is a tutorial for the step-by-step transition planning and implementation of a clinical research intervention from in-person to a web-based platform, using the HHT program as an example. Clinical and research considerations are reviewed, including; (1) privacy; (2) therapeutic aspects of the intervention; (3) group cohesion; (4) research ethics; (5) participant recruitment; (6) assessment measures; (7) data collection; and, (8) data analyses.

Pregnant women are particularly affected. The present study assessed the level of perceived threat (susceptibility, severity, impact), negative emotions (fear, worry) and self-efficacy of COVID-19, and examined their association with mental health (depression and anxiety) and personal protective behavior (wearing face mask) among pregnant women in China. A total of 4,087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional online survey between 3 to 10 March 2020. The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% and 33.0% respectively; 23.8% reported always wearing face mask when going out. Between 32.1% to 36.4% of participants perceived themselves or their family members susceptible to COVID-19 infection, between 78.7% to 86.1% agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. Between 54.7% to 55.7% showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves or their family members from contracting COVID-19; 31.8% reported a high level of fear to the disease, and 68% to 74.8% showed worries about various aspects of COVID-19. Results from multivariate multinominal logistic regressions showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear and worry were risk factors, while self-efficacy was a protective factor for probable depression and anxiety. Results from multivariate logistic regression showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing face mask. Chinese pregnant women showed high level of mental distress but low level of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 period. Interventions are needed to promote their mental health and health behavior.","Mo, Fong, Song, Di, Wang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.2196/24053","20210317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12094,""

We employ a sequential design to analyze statistical and qualitative data. Despite international data suggesting that trust in federal governments reduces anxiety, women who did not trust and actively opposed the Trump administration reported lower levels of anxiety than expected. Results indicate reliance on and development of new forms of connection that seem to mitigate symptomatic anxieties when living in opposition. Women living in opposition to the leadership of the federal government use and develop resources to help them cope.

"Bushfires, COVID-19 and Australian community pharmacists: ongoing impact on mental health and wellbeing","The nation was recovering from the aftermath of the catastrophic 2019-2020 bushfires when the first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Australia. During the peak of the pandemic, Australia closed both its state and international borders to all travelers and interstate travel was very tightly regulated. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were one of the very few primary healthcare workers still serving their communities during these periods of strict lockdown. In this personal view article, the challenges and their toll on the mental health and wellbeing of these &quot;essential workers&quot; are described. Community pharmacists and pharmacy staff were under immense pressure to remain open and serve their communities amidst rapidly changing legislation and, at times, conflicting advice from the range of Australian health agencies. Rapid changes to workload and workflow were combined with the dilemma of balancing professional obligations with the personal duty of keeping themselves and their sometimes geographically distant families safe. Fluctuating demands and traumatic situations found community pharmacy staff often feeling distressed and underprepared. Despite a global pandemic following a season of extraordinary bushfires, it has barely been acknowledged that community pharmacy staff are one of the highest risk groups for long-term psychological impacts. To our knowledge, very little research has addressed the toll of these cataclysmic events on this group of essential healthcare workers.","McCallum, Dunkley, Hotham, Suppiah","https://doi.org/10.1093/ijpp/riaa020","20210317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12096,""

In a prospective uncontrolled cohort study, survivors of COVID-19 who had been hospitalized in a university hospital in France between March 1 and May 29, 2020, underwent a telephone assessment 4 months after discharge, between July 15 and September 18, 2020. Patients with relevant symptoms and all patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) were invited for further assessment at an ambulatory care visit. Survival of hospitalization for COVID-19. Respiratory, cognitive, and functional symptoms were assessed by telephone with the Q3PC cognitive screening questionnaire and a checklist of symptoms. At the ambulatory care visit, patients underwent pulmonary function tests, lung computed tomographic scan, psychometric and cognitive tests (including the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), and, for patients who had been hospitalized in the ICU or reported ongoing symptoms, echocardiography. Among 834 eligible patients, 478 were evaluated by telephone (mean age, 61 years [SD, 16 years]; 201 men, 277 women). During the telephone interview, 244 patients (51%) declared at least 1 symptom that did not exist before COVID-19: fatigue in 31%, cognitive symptoms in 21%, and new-onset dyspnea in 16%. There was further evaluation in 177 patients (37%), including 97 of 142 former ICU patients. The median 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory score (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°130) was 4.5 (interquartile range, 3.0-5.0) for reduced motivation and 3.7 (interquartile range, 3.0-4.5) for mental fatigue (possible range, 1 [best] to 5 [worst]). The median 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey score (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°145) was 25 (interquartile range, 25.0-75.0) for the subscale &quot;role limited owing to physical problems&quot; (possible range, 0 [best] to 100 [worst]). Computed tomographic lung-scan abnormalities were found in 108 of 171 patients (63%), mainly subtle ground-glass opacities. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 33 of 171 patients (19%), involving less than 25% of parenchyma in all but 1 patient. Fibrotic lesions were observed in 19 of 49 survivors (39%) with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Among 94 former ICU patients, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic symptoms were observed in 23%, 18%, and 7%, respectively. The left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 50% in 8 of 83 ICU patients (10%). New-onset chronic kidney disease was observed in 2 ICU patients. Serology was positive in 172 of 177 outpatients (97%). Four months after hospitalization for COVID-19, a cohort of patients frequently reported symptoms not previously present, and lung-scan abnormalities were common among those who were tested. These findings are limited by the absence of a control group and of pre-COVID assessments in this cohort. Further research is needed to understand longer-term outcomes and whether these findings reflect associations with the disease.","Morin, Savale, Pham, Colle, Figueiredo, Harrois, Gasnier, Lecoq, Meyrignac, Noel, Baudry, Bellin, Beurnier, Choucha, Corruble, Dortet, Hardy-Leger, Radiguer, Sportouch, Verny, Wyplosz, Zaidan, Becquemont, Montani, Monnet","https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2021.3331","20210317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12097,""
"Managing noncommunicable diseases during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil: findings from the PAMPA cohort","The objective was to identify the impact of social distance in the management of noncommunicable diseases (NCD) in the adult population from the state of Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil. This is an ambispective, population-based cohort study. Descriptive analysis and Poisson regression models were used and the results were reported as prevalence ratio and 95% confidence intervals. From a total of 1,288 participants, 43.1% needed medical care and 28.5% reported impaired management of NCDs during social distance. Female sex, age between 18 and 30 years old, living in the Serra region (central region of the state), people with depression and multimorbidity were more likely to have impaired management of NCDs. Being physically active reduced the probability of having impaired management of NCD by 15%. Reduced monthly income was associated with the difficulty in accessing prescription medicine and avoidance of seeking in-person medical assistance. Depression was associated with difficulties in accessing medications, while avoidance of seeking in-person medical assistance was more likely for people with multimorbidity, arthritis/arthrosis/fibromyalgia, heart disease, and high cholesterol.","Leite, Feter, Caputo, Doring, Cassuriaga, Reichert, Silva, Rombaldi","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232021263.39232020","20210317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12098,""
"Social representations of media reception during the COVID-19 lockdown in Colombia: from messages to meanings","Recent studies on COVID-19 have focused on the pandemic's effects on public health and the biosafety controls and their socioeconomic implications. The current mixed-methods study takes a new look at the topic, combining qualitative and quantitative strategies to identify the social representations of media reception in a sector of the Colombian population during social isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic. The results indicate that these representations vary and are associated with the media channel and the effect the reception produces on mood and mental health. A total of 80 interviews and 1,068 online survey forms were applied in different regions of Colombia. The qualitative phase showed that the programs or messages received were represented positively when they came from audiovisual entertainment and contributed to the family unit and reduced stress during the lockdown. Meanwhile, media reception was represented negatively when the messages or news came from journalism or social networks and increased the misinformation, anxiety, and fear of contagion. The quantitative phase found that media reception decreased as the lockdown continued, due to information saturation and the proliferation of news emphasizing the risks of COVID-19. The results reveal the need to focus health communication on the development of information skills that allow people to learn and assess the veracity and relevance of information received during the pandemic. Las investigaciones recientes sobre la COVID-19 se han centrado en los efectos de esta pandemia en la salud pÃƒÂºblica, asÃƒÂ­ como en los controles de bioseguridad y sus implicaciones socioeconÃƒÂ³micas. El presente estudio mixto aporta una nueva mirada acerca del tema, combinando estrategias cualitativas y cuantitativas para identificar las representaciones sociales de la recepciÃƒÂ³n mediÃƒÂ¡tica, en un sector de la poblaciÃƒÂ³n en Colombia, durante la cuarentena por la COVID-19. Los resultados indican que estas representaciones son diversas y estÃƒÂ¡n asociadas con el canal mediÃƒÂ¡tico y la afectaciÃƒÂ³n que produce la recepciÃƒÂ³n en el estado de ÃƒÂ¡nimo y la salud mental. En total, se realizaron 80 entrevistas y 1.068 encuestas online en diferentes regiones de Colombia. En la fase cualitativa se encontrÃƒÂ³ que los programas o mensajes recibidos fueron representados positivamente, cuando provienen de la recepciÃƒÂ³n de entretenimiento audiovisual y contribuye a la unidad familiar y a reducir el estrÃƒÂ©s en la cuarentena. De modo contrario, la recepciÃƒÂ³n mediÃƒÂ¡tica fue representada negativamente, cuando los mensajes o noticias recibidas provienen del periodismo o las redes sociales y aumenta la desinformaciÃƒÂ³n, la angustia y el miedo al contagio. En la fase cuantitativa se encontrÃƒÂ³ que la recepciÃƒÂ³n mediÃƒÂ¡tica disminuyÃƒÂ³ a medida que trascurrÃƒÂ­a la cuarentena, debido a la sobresaturaciÃƒÂ³n informativa y a la proliferaciÃƒÂ³n de noticias que enfatizan los riesgos de la COVID-19. Los resultados revelan la necesidad de enfocar la comunicaciÃƒÂ³n en salud al desarrollo de habilidades informacionales que permitan a la ciudadanÃƒÂ­a aprender a evaluar la veracidad y relevancia de la informaciÃƒÂ³n recibida en la pandemia.

"Addressing Stress in High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Safety isolation protocols in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic have had the unintended consequence of social isolation for adolescents, youth who have a developmental need for autonomy and peer connection. Social isolation alone can lead to various psychological effects such as anxiety, stress, low mood, fear, frustration, and boredom. School nurses serve a vital role in addressing stress among adolescents by initiating early interventions, ensuring positive school experiences for students, and providing support surrounding the development of mental health disorders. Through implementation of NASN's Framework for 21st Century School Nursing Practice, school nurses address stress among high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Innovative interventions can include recognizing signs and symptoms of stress on physical and emotional health, advocating for mental health literacy curriculums, social prescribing, incorporating anticipatory guidance related to health promotion lifestyle practices into each school health encounter, and creating a virtual school health office to reach students while COVID-19 safety isolation continues.","Williams, Morse, DeGraffenried, McAuliffe","https://doi.org/10.1177/1942602X21993053","20210317","COVID-19; adolescents; high school students; school nurse; school-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12100,""
"Identifying Psychological Perceptions of People Ignoring the Novel COVID-19 Warnings: A Qualitative Thematic Analysis in Isfahan, Iran","Psychological factors are important for the prevention of disease. This study aims to identify the psychological perceptions of people who are ignoring the warnings of novel COVID-19 infection. A qualitative content analysis was carried out from May to July 2020. The interviewees were selected purposefully from Isfahan, Iran. The saturation point was achieved in 20 semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the transcribed documents using MAXQDA software (version 12).The results revealed 2 themes and 6 sub-themes related to the psychological beliefs of individuals with no attention to corona alerts. Themes and sub-themes included Biased cognitive processing (biased beliefs, attention biases, metacognitive beliefs and Depressogenic schemata), low compassion, and empathy for oneself and others (Negative Emotions towards Oneself, low altruism). To ensure a positive attitude towards precautionary measures in society, the thoughts, perceptions, and behaviors of people who ignore coronavirus alerts need to be changed. This is achieved through the use of mass media and virtual networks, by encouraging people to change their negative attitude towards the use of preventive measures, individual and social protection campaigns, and by fostering a sense of responsibility.","Nosratabadi, Halvaiepour","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12124-021-09608-w","20210317","Coronavirus; Psychological perceptions; Qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12101,""
"Beyond Burnout: Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic Challenges to Self-care","This paper is a review of the self-care challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic on the physical and emotional health and well-being of healthcare providers. New self-care practices are presented. Globally, thousands of health care practitioners and staff have been infected; many have died. Research studies reveal that this pandemic has threatened the health of healthcare staff, their families, and communities in many unique ways, such as fear of infecting family (lack of safety at home), moral injury, witnessing the suffering of the &quot;innocent,&quot; coping with a problem too big to solve (the enormity problem), and racial trauma. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global population in ways not seen in a century. The unique self-care challenges of COVID-19 while enhancing the symptoms of burnout, i.e., physical, and mental exhaustion, despair, helplessness, and suicidal thinking, need to be addressed directly.

"Analysing the impact of COVID-19 on the mothers of Bangladesh: hearing the unheard","The purpose of this empirical study was to understand, explore and analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mothers of our society, with particular emphasis on Bangladesh, which has so far been a relatively unexplored area. The study adopted qualitative and interpretative methods of social research, including content analysis and a perception study of 223 respondents through a semi-structured questionnaire survey, who were selected using purposive random sampling. The data obtained from the perception study was further complemented through phone interviews. The study found that the pandemic has not affected all mothers uniformly; rather, the intensity of its impact varied depending on factors such as the occupation of mothers and their husbands and their family pattern. Despite such variation, all mothers experienced a subsequent increase in workload, challenges while availing routine health facilities and higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression and certain behavioural changes. However, the worst affected have been the mothers belonging to the lower socio-economic strata because the pandemic has made them and their husbands jobless, leading them towards an uncertain future.","Ehsan, Jahan","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-021-01501-5","20210317","Anxiety; Covid-19; Mothers; Pandemic; Stress; Workload","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12103,""
"Mental health in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal examination of the ameliorating effect of meaning salience","During the COVID-19 pandemic, various restrictions forced people around the world to socially isolate. People were asked to stay at home and were largely unable to do many of the activities that they derived meaning from. Since meaning is often related to mental health, these restrictions were likely to decrease mental health. The current study aimed to examine these effects and additionally benefit individuals' mental health by making their meaning salient. Specifically, the goal of the research was to design an intervention that could counter the potential negative effects of social distancing. We recruited a total of 96Ã‚Â U.S.A. residents (<i>M</i><sub> <i>age</i> </sub> Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°34.45, 92.7% Female) and assigned them to either the control group or to a meaning salience intervention. That is, participants either focused on the meaning of their daily activities (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°45) or did not participate in any study-related activities during the week (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°51). They completed various measures of mental health before and after this experimental period. Results suggested that the control group reported significantly greater anxiety, depression, and stress at the end of the week. In contrast, the experimental group reported less anxiety and trended toward less depression and stress at the end of that same week. In all, results suggest that simply focusing on one's daily activities and the meaning found in them protected people fromÃ‚Â the otherwise detrimental effects of the restrictions. This provides a promising and simple intervention that may assist both individuals and practitioners aiming to improve mental health, especially in challenging times.","Klussman, Nichols, Langer","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01538-5","20210317","Anxiety; Depression; Meaning in life; Meaning salience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12104,""
"How much could a low COVID-19 pandemic change the injury trends? A single-institute, retrospective cohort study","COVID-19 has changed the epidemiology of trauma. However, Taiwan is a country with a low COVID-19 threat, and people's daily lives have remained mostly unchanged during this period. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the trend of trauma incidence and the service of trauma care is affected by the relatively minor COVID-19 pandemic in Taiwan. A single-institute, retrograde cohort study. An observational study based on the trauma registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH). Trauma patients presented to the emergency department of CGMH in the period of 1 January to 30 June 2020 (week 1 to week 26) were designated as the COVID-19 group, with 1980 patients in total. Patients of the same period in 2015-2019 were designated as the pre-COVID-19 group, with 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°334 patients overall. The primary outcome is the incidence of trauma admission. Differences in trauma mechanism, severity, location and outcome were also compared in both groups. A decrease in trauma incidence during March and April 2020 was noticed. Significant change (p&lt;0.001) in trauma mechanisms was discovered, with decreased burn (5.8% vs 3.6%) and assault (4.8% vs 1.2%), and increased transport accidents (43.2% vs 47.2%) and suicide (0.2% vs 1.0%) in the COVID-19 cohort. A shift in injury locations was also found with a 5% decrement of workplace injuries (19.8% vs 14.8%, p&lt;0.001). The limited COVID-19 outbreak in Taiwan has led to a decreased incidence of trauma patients, and the reduction is mostly attributed to the decline in workplace injuries.","Kuo, Fu, Liao, Liao, Wu, Huang, Hsieh, Cheng","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-046405","20210317","COVID-19; epidemiology; trauma management","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12105,""

A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey. APNs in any UK setting. The survey was sent to an existing UK-wide cohort of APNs. 124 APNs responded (51%). UK-based APNs in this study reported shortages of staff (51%) and personal protective equipment (PPE) (68%) during the first 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months of the coronavirus outbreak. Almost half (47%) had considered leaving their job over the same 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°months. Despite difficulties, there were reports of positive changes to working practice that have enhanced care. UK APNs report COVID-19-related shortages in staff and equipment across primary and secondary care and all regions of the UK. Shortages of PPE during a pandemic are known to be a factor in the development of mental health sequelae as well as a risk factor for increased turnover and retention issues. Half of APNs surveyed were considering a change in job. The UK risks a further crisis in staff morale and retention if this is not acknowledged and addressed. APNs also expressed concern about patients not receiving routine care as many specialties closed or reduced working during the crisis.

"The prevalence and risk factors for depressive symptoms in frontline nurses under COVID-19 pandemic based on a large cross-sectional study using the propensity score-matched method","To explore the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the associated risk factors in frontline nurses under COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was conducted from February 20, 2020 to March 20, 2020 and involved 562 frontline nurses. The effective response rate was 87.68%. After propensity score matched, there were 498 participants left. Extensive characteristics, including demographics, dietary habits, life-related factors, work-related factors, and psychological factors were collected based on a self-reported questionnaire. Specific scales measured the levels of sleep quality, physical activity, depressive symptoms, perceived organization support and psychological capital. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined by binary paired logistic regression. Of the nurses enrolled in the study, 50.90% had depressive symptoms. Three independent risk factors were identified: poor sleep quality (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.608, 95% CI: 1.384-1.896), lower optimism of psychological capital (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.879, 95% CI: 0.805-0.960) and no visiting friend constantly (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.513, 95% CI: 0.286-0.920). This study revealed a considerable high prevalence of depressive symptoms in frontline nurses during the COVID-19 outbreak, and identified three risk factors, which were poor sleep quality, lower optimism of psychological capital, and no visiting friend constantly.

"Physical and Mental Functions of Cardiovascular Disease Patients Decrease during the State of Emergency Initiated by the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan","We aimed to examine the differences in life-space mobility and quality of life (QoL) of patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) between the pre- and post-nationwide state of emergency initiated by the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in Japan and to show the factors associated with the decrease in life-space mobility and QoL in these patients. We undertook a longitudinal study of 20 of 51 consecutive CVD patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who met the study criteria. We used the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) tool to evaluate Life-space mobility and assessed QoL with the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) in Japanese. The LSA scores and EQ-5D-5L QoL score decreased significantly from the pre- to post-nationwide state of emergency in Japan (p &lt; 0.01). ÃŽâ€LSA was significantly positively associated with body mass index and significantly negatively associated with knee extensor muscle strength and pre-LSA score (p &lt; 0.05).

"Short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with a chronic pain disorder","The current Covid-19 pandemic has already had a definite impact on the daily life of many people worldwide. It has been proposed that people with preexisting medical conditions will be harder hit by the pandemic and the subsequent measures to contain the spread of the disease. In this questionnaire-based, observational study, we aimed to assess the impact of the pandemic on patients with a chronic pain disorder, who are treated at a tertiary multidisciplinary pain center.Participants rated the impact of the pandemic on their chronic pain disorder using a self-designed questionnaire. Also, participants filled out the regular follow-up questionnaire to assess a chronic pain disorder measuring among other parameters pain intensity, symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress, and pain-related quality of life.Of 136 eligible patients who presented to our pain center between May 5th and July 17th, 112 agreed to participate in the study (82.4%). Eighty two participants (73.2%) reported a deterioration of the pain disorder using the self-designed questionnaire. The more robust parameters of the regular follow-up questionnaire showed no relevant changes compared to data collected before the pandemic. We were not able to detect any demographic and medical parameters that were clinically relevantly associated with a higher impact of the pandemic.We conclude that a chronic pain disorder is a relatively stable disease that does not change significantly due to external factors, like the Covid-19 pandemic, even if the subjective impact is perceived to be high.","Lassen, Siam, Degenhart, Klier, Bundscherer, Lindenberg","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000025153","20210317","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12110,""

Six focal cutting-edge technologies are identified: artificial intelligence, augmented reality, virtual reality, wearable technology, robotics and big data analytics. Our analysis shows research on consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies is at a nascent stage, and there are several gaps requiring attention. To further advance knowledge, our article offers avenues for future interdisciplinary research addressing implications of consumer interaction with cutting-edge technologies. More specifically, we propose six main areas for future research namely: rethinking consumer behaviour models, identifying behavioural differences among different generations of consumers, understanding how consumers interact with automated services, ethics, privacy and the blackbox, consumer security concerns and consumer interaction with new-age technologies during and after a major global crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2021.106761","20210701","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12111,""
"Emotions and mood swings of pharmacy students in the context of the coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic","Introduction The coronavirus disease of 2019 pandemic has changed university routines affecting student mental health. The aims of this study were to survey aspects related to mental health of pharmaceutical course students considering previous and current contexts. Methods The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brunel Mood Scale were used. DASS-21 was completed pre- and post-pandemic. The validity and reliability of the data were verified. The prevalence (95% CI) of mental health symptoms was estimated. The relationship between the time spent watching/reading the news and mean scales scores was evaluated (Pearson's correlation coefficient). Results The prevalence of depression symptoms in students pre-pandemic was 66.7% (95% CIÂ =Â 65.3â€“68.1) and during the pandemic was 81% (95% CIÂ =Â 79.8â€“82.2). More than 70% (95% CIÂ =Â 69.8â€“72.6) of participants had some psychological impact as a result of the pandemic (mild: 16.7% [95% CIÂ =Â 15.6â€“17.8]; moderate: 9.1% [95% CIÂ =Â 8.2â€“10]; severe: 45.4% [95% CIÂ =Â 43.9â€“46.9]). High values of tension, depressed mood, mental confusion, and anger were observed. There was a significant correlation between the time spent following the news of the pandemic and symptoms of anxiety (rÂ =Â 0.356; PÂ <Â .001), stress (rÂ =Â 0.248; PÂ =Â .014), hyperarousal (rÂ =Â 0.322; PÂ =Â 0.001), and intrusion (rÂ =Â 0.21; PÂ =Â .039). Conclusions Students are highly vulnerable to depressive symptoms and mood swings due to the pandemic. These findings deserve consideration mainly from mental health professionals, but also from managers and educators.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cptl.2021.01.034","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-03-18","",12112,""
