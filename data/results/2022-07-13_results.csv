"Effect of Stay-at-Home Orders and Other COVID-Related Policies on Trauma Hospitalization Rates and Disparities in the United States: A Statewide Time-Series Analysis","Background: To combat the coronavirus pandemic, states implemented several public health policies to reduce infection and transmission. Increasing evidence suggests that these prevention strategies also have had a profound impact on non-COVID healthcare utilization. The goal of this study was to determine the impact of a statewide Stay-at-Home and other COVID-related policies on trauma hospitalizations, stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and sex. Methods: We used the North Carolina Trauma Registry, a statewide registry of trauma hospitalizations to 18 hospitals across North Carolina, including all North Carolina trauma centers, to calculate weekly assault, self-inflicted, unintentional motor vehicle collision (MVC), and other unintentional injury hospitalization rates between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. Interrupted time-series design and segmented linear regression were used to estimate changes in hospitalizations rates after several COVID-related executive orders, overall and stratified by race/ethnicity, age, and gender. Hospitalization rates were compared after 1) U.S. declaration of a public health emergency; 2) North Carolina statewide Stay-at-Home order; 3) Stay-at-Home order lifted with restrictions (Phase 2: Safer-at-Home); and 4) further lifting of restrictions (Phase 2.5: Safer-at-Home). Results. There were 70,478 trauma hospitalizations in North Carolina from 2019-2020. In 2020, median age was 53 years old and 59% were male. Assault hospitalization rates (per 1,000,000 NC residents) increased after the Stay-at-Home order, but only among Black/African American residents (incidence rate difference [IRD]=7.9; other racial/ethnic groups IRDs ranged 0.9 to 1.7) and 18-44 year-old males (IRD=11.9; other sex/age groups IRDs ranged -0.5 to 3.6). After major restrictions were lifted, assault rates returned to pre-COVID levels. Unintentional injury hospitalizations decreased after the public health emergency, especially among older adults, but returned to 2019 levels within several months. Conclusions: Statewide Stay-at-Home orders put Black/African American residents at higher risk for assault hospitalizations, exacerbating pre-existing disparities. Fear of COVID-19 may have also led to decreases in unintentional non-MVC hospitalization rates, particularly among older adults. Policy makers must anticipate possible negative effects and develop approaches for mitigating harms that may disproportionately affect already disadvantaged communities.","Paula D Strassle; Alan C Kinlaw; Jamie S Ko; Stephanie Quintero; Jackie Bonilla; Madison Ponder; Anna MarÃ­a NÃ¡poles; Sharon E Schiro","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.11.22277511","20220712","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34147,""
"Structural epitope profiling identifies antibodies associated with critical COVID-19 and long COVID","Antibodies can have beneficial, neutral, or harmful effects so resolving an antibody repertoire to its target epitopes may explain heterogeneity in susceptibility to infectious disease. However, the three-dimensional nature of antibody-epitope interactions limits discovery of important targets. We describe and experimentally validated a computational method and synthetic biology pipeline for identifying structurally stable and functionally important epitopes from the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. We identify patterns of antibodies associated with immunopathology, including a non-isotype switching IgM response to a membrane protein epitope strongly associated with severe COVID-19 (adjusted OR 72.14, 95% CI: 9.71 - 1300.15). We suggest the mechanism is T independent B cell activation and identify persistence (> 1 year) of this response in individuals with long COVID particularly affected by fatigue and depression. These findings may have implications for the ongoing medical and public health response to the pandemic.","Patrick K.A.

"Effects of COVID-19 on coffee market participation of smallholder coffee producers' in Godere District, Southwestern Ethiopia","In sub-Saharan countries like Ethiopia, COVID-19 affected not only the health sector, but also the agricultural productivity and marketing, especially affecting coffee producers' probability of market participation. The study was conducted on the effects of COVID-19 on smallholder coffee producers' coffee market participation in Godere district, southwestern Ethiopia. This study aimed to identify the effects of COVID-19 on coffee producers, its effect on the decisions of market participation mechanisms, and the prevention mechanisms employed during the pandemic. For this study, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from primary and secondary sources by using a semi-structured interview schedule with well-trained data collectors. The data was analyzed, and a simple random sampling technique was used to select 384 coffee producers at 95% confidence level. The study result shows that the level of coffee producers' market participation was reduced from 100% to 81.25% because of COVID-19's effect on smallholder farmers, with 18.75% failing to participate in the coffee market. COVID-19 prevention mechanism provided by the government for social movement was strongly affecting farmer levels of market participation. Most of the coffee producers agreed that COVID-19 affected their probability of coffee market participation because concerned stakeholders in the sector were not well subsidized to recover from the depression. Most of the farmers were not effectively getting financial services from aid organizations and government to mitigate the impact on their livelihood. Generally, COVID-19 strongly affected the levels of coffee producers' market participation, and it is advisable for concerned bodies to support producers by providing subsidies and creating market linkages.","Temesgen, Kabeta, Mabiratu, Dangia","https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6993380","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication type: article; Publication details: Advances in Agriculture; 6993380(26), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34149,""
"Federated Learning Driven Secure Internet of Medical Things","With the outbreak of COVID-19, people are experiencing increasing physical and mental health issues. Therefore, personal daily healthcare and monitoring become vital for our physical and mental well being. As a combination of the Internet of Things (IoT) and healthcare services, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has emerged to provide intelligent medical services. However, privacy and security concerns have deterred its wide adoption. In this article, we propose a Federated Learning Driven IoMT (FLDIoMT) framework, which aims to support flexible deployment of IoMT services and address the privacy and security issues at the same time. Also, a systematic workflow of IoMT services is proposed to show an efficient data processing and analysis scheme for specific medical applications. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed FLDIoMT framework by implementing a novel sleep monitoring system called iSmile.","Fan, Junqiao, Wang, Xuehe, Guo, Yanxiang, Hu, Xiping, Hu, Bin","https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.008.00475","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: IEEE Wireless Communications; 29(2):68-75, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34150,""
"Social Robots: The Friend of the Future or Mechanical Mistake?","Isolation can manifest anywhere a person chooses to age. It is detrimental to mental health and is compared to smoking cigarettes and obesity [1] . While interaction with another human being is preferable, sometimes, individuals are not able to do this. Older adults who live far from their families, individuals inside assisted living facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, and individuals who have a limited social circle due to retirement or loss of friends may all feel isolated [2] .

"CONTINUUM OF GERIATRIC CARE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH DUAL SENSORY LOSS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN CANADA: LESSONS LEARNED","Introduction Around 1.1 million older Canadians live with combined hearing and vision impairment (dual sensory loss/DSL). Evidence highlights that they are at a high risk of cognitive impairment, functional decline, social isolation, falls, depression, and mortality. Compared to their non-DSL peers, older adults with DSL experience various challenges in accessing healthcare, which were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the continuum of geriatric care for older adults with DSL by integrating their perspectives, those of caregivers who accompany them on healthcare visits, and their healthcare providers in Canada during the pandemic. Method We conducted a qualitative study with 32 older Canadians with DSL and their caregivers, and an online survey with 228 healthcare providers across the country. Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded using Zoom and transcribed verbatim, while the survey data were collected using Lime Survey. Thematic analysis was used to analyse qualitative data, whereas descriptive statistics were used for quantitative survey data. Results The findings highlighted the gaps in the continuum of care for this population. The reported gaps were lack of training on DSL among healthcare providers, lack of time and comfort to go beyond oneâ€™s specialty, lack or limited support to overcome communication challenges while providing care to older adults with DSL, difficulty in using technologies for virtual/telehealth, presence of comorbidities such as cognitive impairment, and restrictions in caregiver accompaniment during the pandemic. Conclusion Our findings indicate that the continuum of care for this group is negatively affected due to the pandemic, in a disproportionate manner, and structural barriers are experienced by older adults with DSL and their caregivers for access to care. To ensure effective care, healthcare professionals need training on DSL-specific accessibility and communication. A collaborative, cross-disciplinary geriatric care approach with the active involvement of essential care partners is an utmost need.","Jaiswal, A.; Holzhey, P.; Budhiraja, S.; Paramasivam, A.; Santhakumaran, S.; CÃ¶tÃ©, S.; Boie, N.

"Hispanic students in higher education: A case for trauma informed approaches","This secondary study focused on Hispanic college studentsâ€™ experiences with the COVID19 pandemic and their academic success with instructors who implemented trauma-informed approaches and sought to add to the knowledge base of the literature to support the necessity of establishing trauma-informed policies and pedagogical practices in Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). Data from an exploratory study conducted in the summer 2020 semester at a small, private, HSI was utilized (N = 309). Most participants were Hispanic Nonwhite (65%). Results indicate that among all racial/ethnic group participants, Hispanic participants were more likely to have experienced a family member or close friend who died from the COVID-19 virus, X 2 (3, N = 297)Â = 10.1, p= .017. Additionally, Hispanic participants reported an increase in stress (44%), anxiety (38%), and depression (29%). Finally, there was a statistically significant difference in Hispanic participant expected grade outcomes compared to all other races when instructors implemented trauma-informed practices X2  (1, N = 234)Â = 5.964, p = .01. The ultimate goal of higher education institutions is to ensure academic success for students. Utilizing trauma-informed approaches in higher education will help generate safe, supportive, and respectful environments that have been shown to positively effect academic success.

"Dating anxiety during the global COVID-19 pandemic: Implications for college students","Dating anxiety (i.e., anxiety experienced when initiating and/or maintaining a romantic connection) is prevalent in the college student population. Dating anxiety may contribute to psychological distress and diminished life satisfaction and has been found to be associated with depressive symptoms. The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated preventative strategies that may negatively impact college students' ability to socialize and thus potentially worsen their mental health. The current study examined whether the relationship between dating anxiety and depressive symptoms was moderated by perceived impact of COVID-19. Participants included college students (N = 225) enrolled at a large Midwestern university and were 18-23 years of age (Mage = 18.95). Participants completed self-report measures of demographics, dating anxiety, perceived impact of COVID-19, and depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with dating anxiety, beta = .40, 95% CI [.292, .513], and COVID-19 impact, beta = .33, 95% CI [.220, .436]. The interaction term (Dating Anxiety x COVID-19 Impact) was significant, beta = .15, 95% CI [.062, .240], such that the relationship between higher dating anxiety and greater depressive symptoms strengthened as COVID-19 impact increased. Our findings demonstrate that increased dating anxiety is related to increased depressive symptoms, which are worsened by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. College students more strongly impacted by COVID-19 may have increased dating anxiety because of decreased exposure to social situations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement The current results have particular implications for mental health services provided to college students.

"Strengthening intersecting identities of diverse AAPIs through and post COVID-19: Guidelines for psychological practitioners","This article offers guidelines for psychological practitioners on ways to best support the well-being of Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPIs) through the COVID-19 global pandemic. The article argues that strengthening the connection with their intersecting identities is essential to the well-being of diverse AAPIs, especially given three interconnected and added strains: anti-Asian rhetoric and ensuing violence, invisible and intensified structural inequalities, and exacerbated mental health disparity. To facilitate AAPIs ongoing development and connection with their intersecting identities, three complementary theoretical approaches are introduced as the foundation of practice guidelines offered. The approaches include a culturally affirming developmental approach that fosters growth and resilience consistent with AAPIs identities;a multicultural feminist approach that promotes, empowers, and advocates for AAPIs by acknowledging structural power differentials within multiple interlocking systems of oppression;and a social justice-oriented psychoanalytic approach that recognizes structural impacts and offers attentive listening to the voices of AAPIs whose experiences are otherwise unheard. To support AAPIs through and beyond the pandemic, psychological practitioners must familiarize themselves with identity development theories relevant to AAPIs, participate in social advocacy by acknowledging and affirming differences within and external to AAPI communities, and expand on one's ability to listen for the diverse experiences that are unspoken, unheard, or uncomfortable to digest embedded in the oppressive structure. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Strengthening Asian American/Pacific Islanders (AAPIs') connection with intersecting identities is key to AAPIs collective well-being given the three added and interconnected strains (i.e., intensified anti-Asian rhetoric, structural inequality, and mental health disparity) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Practitioners should incorporate advocacy, recognize power differentials, and engage in depthful listening when helping AAPIs develop toward an increasingly mature and nuanced connection with their intersecting identities, which contribute to resilience and healing.

"Experience and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus in France","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and its successive lockdowns are considered as anxious periods, especially for immunocompromised patients such as those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In addition to the personal and professional difficulties linked to the pandemic, care supply or access to treatment (such as hydroxychloroquine, HCQ) may have affected these patients. The aim of this work was to assess the experience and the impact of these difficulties endured by patients with SLE during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anonymous survey conducted in France and DOM-TOM departments via paper or online forms (SurveyLegendÂ® platform). Patients with SLE were recruited with the support of the French Association of Lupus (AFL +) as well as through their treating specialist. Socio-demographic data were collected, and the impact of lockdowns was assessed by validated questionnaires aimed at assessing perceived stress (Perceived Stress scale 10), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS) and the occurrence post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD Checklist for DSM-5, PCL-5). Participants consented to the use of their data and the survey methodology was validated by an independent ethics committee (CE-2020-151). Five hundred thirty-six questionnaires were collected from SLE patients between November 2020 and April 2021. The median age was 50 years [IQR: 39â€“60] and 91.9% of patients were female. Their disease had progressed for a median of 17 [9â€“25] years, 77% were treated with HCQ, 50% with corticosteroids and 33% with immunosuppressive treatments. During the pandemic, 85 patients ceased their professional activity (technical unemployment n = 55, dismissal n = 30). Financial difficulties were reported by 76 patients (15.9%), with a significant predominance among those who interrupted their professional activity36.9% vs. 9.3%, p &lt; 0.0001). Of the patients treated with HCQ, 23.9% (92/385) had difficulty accessing the HCQ responsible for its interruption in 58 patients (median duration 7 [3â€“17] days). Perceived stress was significant (PSS-10 = 27/40) for 11.8% of patients. An anxiety or depressive syndrome was detected in 47.6% and 41.5% of patients, respectively. Scores compatible with post-traumatic stress disorder were found in 39% of patients. Female sex (OR = 4.50 [95% CI: 1.28â€“15.8]), the presence of financial difficulties (OR = 2.71 [1.30â€“5.6]) and access to HCQ (OR = 2.07 [1.16â€“3.69]) during the pandemic were significantly associated with the presence of post-traumatic stress disorder. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many difficulties for patients with LS, with a high prevalence of mental disorders. These were in particular anxiety or depressive syndromes and states of post-traumatic stress associated with difficulties in accessing treatment or changes in professional activity.

"What we have learned from two decades of epidemics and pandemics: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the psychological burden of frontline healthcare workers","Objective Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future disease threats, a profound comprehension of the impact of epidemics and pandemics on healthcare providers' mental health is needed to address these current and future global health challenges, Thus, aim of this study was to quantify psychological and psychosomatic symptoms among healthcare staff working on the frontlines of SARS-CoV-1, H1N1, Ebola, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2. Methods We systematically searched four databases and additional literature, including daily search alerts. Two reviewers independently performed all methodological steps, involving a third reviewer in case of dissent We pooled the overall symptom prevalence rates applying random effects modeling and calculated the 12 to account for statistical heterogeneity. Results Of 1995 retrieved records, we assessed 417 full texts for eligibility, and included 86 studies. Frontline providers suffered from various symptoms, like concern about transmitting the virus to family (60.39%, 95% CI 42.53-76.96) and concern about own health (45.97%, 95% CI 31.08-61.23), sleep disturbances (39.88%, 95% CI 27.70-52.72), burnout (31.81%, 95% CI 13.32-53.89), depression (25.72%. 95% CI 18.34-33.86), anxiety (25.36%, 95% CI 17.90-33.64), posttraumatic stress disorder (24.51%, 95% CI 18.16-31.46), and somatization (14.68%, 95% CI 10.67-19.18). Conclusion Our findings, based on information from 75,991 participants, highlight the severe psychological effects of epidemics and pandemics on frontline staff. As another COVID-19 wave, driven by Delta and, Omicron, puts even more strain on an already exhausted ' medical system and healthcare providers face aggression and threats from anti-vaccine activists, providing tailored psychological support for the healthcare workforce becomes all the more important.","Busch, I.; Moretti, F.; Mazzi, M.; Wu, A.; Rimondini, M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2022.110833","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research; 157:1, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34158,""

Objetivo Describir los efectos de un programa de ejercicio terapÃ©utico en personas con enfermedad cardiovascular que realizan telerrehabilitaciÃ³n, en el periodo de aislamiento preventivo obligatorio por COVID-19. Materiales y mÃ©todos Estudio cuasiexperimental, de 6 meses, en personas con enfermedad cardiovascular que ingresaron a un programa de ejercicio terapÃ©utico asistido por tecnologÃ­a virtual en una clÃ­nica de Cali (Colombia). Resultados De 31 personas, 21 eran hombres. La edad promedio fue de 60,48Â±11,21 aÃ±os. Se encontraron diferencias significativas al inicio y al final del estudio en las variables de fracciÃ³n de eyecciÃ³n del ventrÃ­culo izquierdo, frecuencia cardiaca, presiÃ³n arterial, frecuencia respiratoria, Ã­ndice de masa corporal, perÃ­metro de abdomen, porcentaje de grasa, porcentaje de masa muscular, colesterol, estado de depresiÃ³n, distancia recorrida, consumo de oxÃ­geno e Ã­ndice metabÃ³lico (MET), con p <0,05. ConclusiÃ³n Un programa de ejercicio terapÃ©utico en personas con enfermedad cardiovascular que realizan telerrehabilitaciÃ³n resulta eficaz, al alcanzar las metas de tratamiento. Introduction Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of morbidity and death globally. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many rehabilitation programs have shifted to remote delivery models. Telerehabilitation is a way to perform cardiac rehabilitation while reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Objective This study aimed to describe the effects of a physical exercise program in persons with cardiovascular disease who performed telerehabilitation in the period of mandatory preventive isolation due to the COVID-19 emergency. Materials and methods This was a quasiexperimental 6-month study of persons with cardiovascular disease who entered a virtual technology-assisted physical exercise program in a clinic in Cali, Colombia. Results Significant differences were found at the beginning and end of the study in the variables of left ventricular ejection fraction, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, body mass index, abdominal perimeter, percentage of fat, percentage of muscle mass, cholesterol, state of depression, distance traveled, oxygen consumption and metabolic equivalent (METs), showing p-value <0.05. Conclusions A physical exercise program in persons with cardiovascular disease performing telerrehabilitation proves effective in achieving treatment goals.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ft.2022.05.003","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34163,""
"Couples challenged during the lockdown caused due to COVID-19 pandemic","Objectifs Les mesures sanitaires prises pour faire face Ã  la pandÃ©mie de COVID-19Â ont donnÃ© lieu Ã  un confinement strict de la population dont les effets dÃ©lÃ©tÃ¨res ont Ã©tÃ© Ã©tudiÃ©s notamment sur le plan de la santÃ© mentale. Notre Ã©tude a pour objectif dâ€™explorer les facteurs associÃ©s Ã  lâ€™intimitÃ© et au vÃ©cu des couples au cours de cette pÃ©riode. MÃ©thodologie Au cours du mois dâ€™avril 2020, soit lors du premier confinement, nous avons diffusÃ© un questionnaire en ligne. Au total, 1985Â adultes (80,3Â % de femmesÂ ; M=34,27, ET=14,96) ont participÃ© Ã  lâ€™Ã©tude. Plusieurs Ã©chelles validÃ©es ont permis dâ€™Ã©valuer le contexte de vie, la santÃ© mentale, la consommation de substances (alcool et cannabis), lâ€™intolÃ©rance Ã  lâ€™incertitude et lâ€™intimitÃ© dans le couple. Des questions ouvertes invitaient les participant.e.s Ã  dÃ©crire leur vÃ©cu au sein de leur couple. RÃ©sultats Au niveau statistique, nos rÃ©sultats indiquent que les couples qui vivaient dans des foyers sÃ©parÃ©s pendant le confinement (n =453Â ou 22,8Â % de notre Ã©chantillon) Ã©taient plus dÃ©primÃ©s, plus anxieux et plus intolÃ©rants Ã  lâ€™incertitude. Ã€ travers une analyse thÃ©matique, nous avons constatÃ© que les couples confinÃ©s ensemble Ã©taient plus susceptibles de signaler une amÃ©lioration de la qualitÃ© de leur vie Ã©motionnelle et sexuelle que les couples sÃ©parÃ©s par le confinement. Toutefois, la restriction de lâ€™espace disponible, la rÃ©organisation du travail et des loisirs et les relations avec les enfants sont apparus comme des facteurs de stress potentiels. Conclusion Le ou la partenaire intime peut constituer une forme de soutien face au stress durant le confinement et un support de rÃ©silience en situation de crise pandÃ©mique. Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in strict containment. The isolation and anxietyinducing nature of the situation had an impact on the mental health of individuals. Our study examines the intimacy of individuals confined with or without their partners during this period and explores the risk factors and resources available to them. Methodology We distributed an online questionnaire during the first lockdown (April 2020). In total, 1985 adults (80.3% female; M=34.27, SD=14.96) participated in the study. Several validated scales assessed life context, mental health, substance use (alcohol and cannabis), intolerance of uncertainty and intimacy in the couple. Participants described their experiences through open-ended questions. Results Our results indicate that couples who lived in separate households during confinement (n =453 or 22.8% of our sample) were more depressed, more anxious and more intolerant of uncertainty. Through a thematic analysis, we found that couples who were confined together were more likely to report an improvement in the quality of their emotional and sexual life than couples separated by confinement. However, restriction of available space, reorganisation of work and leisure activities and relationships with children emerged as potential stressors. Conclusion The intimate partner can be a form of support for stress during containment and supports resilience in a pandemic crisis.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psfr.2022.06.002","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34164,""
"The Very Temporary Effect of Covid-19 on English Fertility","This note reports estimates of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on English fertility. It uses monthly data on the General Fertility Rate (GFR) over the period 2011-2021 to estimate dynamic models of the GFR, some of which include measures of menâ€™s and women's unemployment rates. The models are used to generate monthly counterfactual fertility during 2020-21 from which the impact of the pandemic is inferred. The Covid pandemic had a very short-term depressing impact on fertility. It reduced conceptions sharply during the first wave of the pandemic (April 2020), affecting fertility in January 2021, but this was fully compensated for by a higher fertility during the last 10 months of 2021. It also appears that changes in unemployment rates played little role in these pandemic-related fertility movements.","John Ermisch","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E00F0-082-64A","20220713","SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; SocArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics; covid -19; fertility; forecasting; time series","SocArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-13","",34165,""
