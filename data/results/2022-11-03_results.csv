"Older Adults' Attitudes Regarding COVID-19 and Associated Infection Control Measures in Shanghai, and Impact on Well-Being","This cross-sectional study investigated health management, well-being, and pandemic-related perspectives in Shanghainese adults [&ge;]50 years during early and strict COVID-19 control measures. A self-report survey was administered via Wenjuanxing between March-April/2020. Items from the Somatic Symptom Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 were administered, as well as pandemic-specific questions. 1181 primarily married, retired females participated; Many had hypertension (n=521, 44.1%), coronary artery disease (CAD; n=201, 17.8%) and diabetes (n=171, 14.5%). While most respondents (n=868; 73.5%) were strictly following control measures (including limiting visits with children; n=390, 33.0%) and perceived they could tolerate that beyond 6 months (n=555;47.0%), they were optimistic about the future if control measures were continued (n=969;82.0%), and perceived impact would be temporary (n=646;64.7%). 52 of those with any condition (8.2%) and 19 of those without a condition (3.5%) reported the pandemic was impacting their health. Somatic symptoms were high (29.4{+/-}7.1/36), with Sleep & Cognitive symptoms highest. 24.4% and 18.9% of respondents had elevated depressive and anxious symptoms, respectively; greater distress was associated with lower income (p=0.018), having hypertension (p=0.001) and CAD (p<0.001), more negative perceptions of global COVID-19 control (p=0.004), COVID-19 spread (p[&le;]0.001), impact on life and health (p<0.001), compliance with control measures (p<0.001), and shorter time control measures could be tolerated (p<0.001) in adjusted analyses. In the initial COVID-19 outbreak, most older adults were optimistic and resilient with regard to the epidemic and control measures. However, the distress of older adults is not trivial, particularly in those with health issues.","Lixian Cui; Zhiming Xu; Gabriela L M Ghisi; Xia Liu; Sherry L Grace","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.10.26.22281511","20221031","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40127,""
"Nurse well-being: A concept analysis","Background: An understanding of nurse well-being remains elusive, particularly in the current toxic health care environment. Therefore, a conceptual definition of nurse well-being is needed. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to report results of a concept analysis of nurse well-being.Methods: Rodgers' Evolutionary Method of concept analysis was used to examine the attributes, antecedents, consequences, and related concepts of nurse well-being.Findings: Findings revealed varying levels of nurse well-being: individual, organiza-tional and community. Individual attributes included happiness, satisfaction, optimism, compassion, gratitude, forgiveness, and sound body/spirit. Organiza-tional/community attributes included teamwork, sense of mission, pride in work, and social integration. Antecedents reflected commonalities with Maslow's hier-archy of needs, ranging from basic human needs to self-actualization. Conse-quences included resilience, collegial relationships, continued growth and development, empowerment, purposeful work, and physical/mental health.Discussion: Standardized definitions of individual and organizational/community nurse well-being should guide future research and policy development. Organi-zations must build capacity for nurses' well-being and explore its connection to patient safety and quality outcomes.Cite this article: Patrician, P.A., Bakerjian, D., Billings, R., Chenot, T., Hooper, V., Johnson, C.S., & Sables-Baus, S.

"Collective response to the health crisis among German twitter users: A structural","We used structural topic modeling to analyze over 800,000 German tweets about COVID-19 to answer the questions: What patterns emerge in tweets as a response to a health crisis? And how do topics discussed change over time? The study leans on the goals associated with the health information seeking (GAINS) model, discerning whether a post aims at tackling and eliminating the problem (i.e., problem-focused) or managing the emotions (i.e., emotion-focused);whether it strives to maximize positive outcomes (promotion focus) or to minimize negative outcomes (prevention focus). The findings indicate four clusters salient in public reactions: 1) â€œUnderstandingâ€ (problem-promotion);2) â€œAction planningâ€ (problem-prevention);3) â€œHopeâ€ (emotion-promotion) and 4) â€œReassuranceâ€ (emotion-prevention). Public communication is volatile over time, and a shift is evidenced from self-centered to community-centered topics within 4.5 weeks. Our study illustrates social media text mining's potential to quickly and efficiently extract public opinions and reactions. Monitoring fears and trending topics enable policymakers to rapidly respond to deviant behavior, like resistive attitudes toward containment measures or deteriorating physical health. Healthcare workers can use the insights to provide mental health services for battling anxiety or extensive loneliness from staying home.","Abramova, Olga, Batzel, Katharina, Modesti, Daniela","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jjimei.2022.100126","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Information Management Data Insights; 2(2):100126, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40129,""
"Examining the effects of COVID-19 on pharmacy dispensing of naloxone and syringes sales across Massachusetts and New Hampshire","Background COVID-19 lockdowns disrupted access to harm reduction supplies and services known to be effective in overdose prevention and contributed to a worsening of the opioid crisis. However, because pharmacies can provide naloxone and sell over-the-counter (OTC) sterile syringes, their continued operation throughout the pandemic potentially reinforced a public health role as a distribution hub for safer use supplies. Objectives The objective of this analysis was to examine patterns of naloxone and OTC syringe sale volume at 463 community pharmacies in two states with high overdose rates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We analyzed weekly pharmacy-level dispensing data from January 5, 2020, to December 31, 2020, from one corporate community pharmacy chain in Massachusetts (n=415 pharmacies) and New Hampshire (n=48 pharmacies). Descriptive statistics and visualizations over the analytic period were generated as initial explorations of the outcome. Zero-inflated Poisson and negative binomial models were used to analyze distribution data along with county-level COVID-19 case rates and store-level COVID-19 testing location status during the same time. Interactions tested the effect of COVID-19 case rates on naloxone and OTC syringe sales. Results Pharmacies that reported selling non-prescription syringes and dispensing naloxone during the study period averaged 210.13 OTC syringes sold and 0.53 naloxone prescriptions per week. Pharmacies in communities that experienced greater COVID-19 case burden also exhibited higher naloxone dispensing and OTC syringe sales during this period. The odds of selling OTC syringes increased over time but naloxone dispensing remained constant over the pandemic year. Pharmacies hosting COVID-19 testing tended to have lower OTC syringe sales and naloxone provision than non-testing sites. Conclusions During the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacies provided harm reduction services and dispensed lifesaving medications by quickly adapting to fulfill community needs without disrupting co-located services for COVID-19 response.","Bolivar, Derek, Hartung, Daniel, Silcox, Joseph, Bratberg, Jeffrey, Boggis, Jesse, Rabin, Megan, Green, Traci C.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.japh.2022.10.012","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the American Pharmacists Association;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40130,""
"A stakeholder-driven framework for measuring potential change in the health risks of people who inject drugs (PWID) during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background People who inject drugs (PWID) have likely borne disproportionate health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. PWID experienced both interruptions and changes to drug supply and delivery modes of harm reduction, treatment, and other medical services, leading to potentially increased risks for HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and overdose. Given surveillance and research disruptions, proximal, indirect indicators of infectious diseases and overdose should be developed for timely measurement of health effects of the pandemic on PWID. Methods We used group concept mapping and a systems thinking approach to produce an expert stakeholder-generated, multi-level framework for monitoring changes in PWID health outcomes potentially attributable to COVID-19 in the U.S. This socio-ecological measurement framework elucidates proximal and distal contributors to infectious disease and overdose outcomes, many of which can be measured using existing data sources. Results The framework includes multi-level components including policy considerations, drug supply/distribution systems, the service delivery landscape, network factors, and individual characteristics such as mental and general health status and service utilization. These components are generally mediated by substance use and sexual behavioral factors to cause changes in incidence of HIV, HCV, sexually transmitted infections, wound/skin infections, and overdose. Conclusion This measurement framework is intended to increase the quality and timeliness of research on the impacts of COVID-19 in the context of the current pandemic and future crises. Next steps include a ranking process to narrow the drivers of change in health risks to a concise set of indicators that adequately represent framework components, can be written as measurable indicators, and are quantifiable using existing data sources, as well as a publicly available web-based platform for summary data contributions.","Bradley, Heather, Austin, Chelsea, Allen, Sean T.; Asher, Alice, Bartholomew, Tyler S.; Board, Amy, Borquez, Annick, Buchacz, Kate, Carter, Anastasia, Cooper, Hannah L.

"The Venezuelan diaspora: Migration-related experiences and mental health","Since 2015, the Venezuelan diaspora has poured forth from the Venezuelan sending context into an array of (mostly) middle-income receiving countries and into the United States (US) as well. For many Venezuelan migrants, post-migration reception has been mixed, and multiple studies suggest that mental health is an important challenge with discrimination and negative context reception contributing to mental health burden in terms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. Cross-national research points to important sociodemographic differences between Venezuelan migrants resettled in South American contexts and in the US, and suggests that-on average-migration-related cultural stress is lower and mental health outcomes are better among those resettling in South Florida and elsewhere in the US.","Salas-Wright, C.

"Prevalence and factors associated with mild depressive and anxiety symptoms in older adults living with HIV from the Kenyan coast","Introduction Empirical research on the burden and determinants of common mental disorders (CMDs), especially depression and anxiety, among older adults living with HIV (OALWH) in sub-Saharan Africa is inadequate. To bridge the gap in Kenya we: (1) determined the prevalence of CMDs among OALWH on routine HIV care compared to HIV-negative peers;(2) investigated HIV status as an independent predictor of CMDs in older adults;and (3) investigated CMD determinants. Methods In a cross-sectional study conducted between 2020 and 2021, the prevalence of CMDs and associated determinants were investigated at the Kenyan coast among 440 adults aged &gt;= 50 years (257 OALWH). The Patient Health Questionnaire and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale were administered alongside measures capturing biopsychosocial information. Logistic regression was used to examine the correlates of CMDs. Results No significant differences were found in the prevalence of mild depressive symptoms, 23.8% versus 18.2% (p = 0.16) and mild anxiety symptoms, 11.7% versus 7.2% (p = 0.12) among OALWH compared to HIV-negative peers, respectively. HIV status was not independently predictive of CMDs. Among OALWH, higher perceived HIV-related stigma, ageism, increasing household HIV burden, loneliness, increasing functional disability, sleeping difficulties, chronic fatigue and advanced age (&gt;70 years) were associated with elevated CMDs. Among HIV-negative older adults, loneliness, increased medication burden and sleeping difficulties were associated with elevated depressive symptoms. Easier access to HIV care was the only factor associated with lower CMDs among OALWH. Conclusions On the Kenyan coast, the burden of moderate and severe CMDs among older adults is low;however, both OALWH and their HIV-negative peers have a similar relatively high burden of mild depressive and anxiety symptoms. Our results also suggest that determinants of CMDs among OALWH in this setting are predominantly psychosocial factors. These results highlight the need for psychosocial interventions (at the family, community and clinical levels) to mitigate the risks of mild CMDs as they are known to be potentially debilitating.","Mwangala, P.

"Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant infection: A report of three cases in a single family","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that has resulted in global pandemic and crisis in health care system. Several studies have focused only on hospitalized patients with 30 to 90 days after one cycle of illness but post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 existing even after a year remains unclear. Moreover, long-term sequelae in outpatients have not been documented and henceforth myriad clinical sequelae in long haulers continue to evolve. In this study, we report three cases represents a single family presenting several post-acute sequelae one after the other extending beyond one year of recovery. To our knowledge such a case series has not been reported in earlier studies. Herein, we present the sequelae in various organs namely neuropsychiatric (tinnitus, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and posttraumatic stress disorder, cognitive decline), cardiovascular (tachycardia, bradycardia), gastrointestinal (appendicitis) and Dermatologic (erythematous rash and acne) besides ophthalmic manifestations (conjunctivitis and dry eyes) in Long-COVID-19 and recommend management strategies.","Pandian, C.

"Communicating Compassion in Pedagogy: Lessons From COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented uncertainty and unpleasant feelings among a variety of individuals and populations. Mental health challenges rooted in feelings of social isolation, and for some grief and loss, have sparked dialogue about the importance of communicating compassion during times of crisis. This chapter focuses on instructor-student interactions in the throes of COVID-19 and the critical significance of compassionate pedagogy. While instructors often engage in caring for their students, the authors of this chapter propose that putting forth care and concern or verbalizing empathy or sympathy is drastically different than engaging in compassionate pedagogy. Simply, instructors who show compassion toward their students in times of struggle are actively motivated to alleviate student anxieties or stress through practical accommodation(s). In this chapter, strategies are outlined to give educators the means to implement compassionate pedagogy toward students during and beyond a global crisis.","Meluch, A. L.; Hannah, M.

A total of 865 first-year university students who studied at Prince of Songkla University were assessed by PHQ-9 online questionnaires during their first trimester of higher education and the second outbreak of COVID-19 in Thailand. Descriptive analysis, Chi-square and logistic regression analysis were conducted using R software package. The majority of the students who studied at Pattani campus, located in armed conflicted areas of southern Thailand, were female and Muslim, whereas most of those who studied at Hat Yai Campus, located in a nearby province, were Buddhist. About half of the students studying at Pattani and Hat Yai Campuses showed mild-to-severe depressive symptoms, without statistically significant difference between two campuses. However, 20% of those who studied at Pattani campus showed moderate-tosevere depression. Frequency of exercise was significantly associated with depressive symptoms among students who studied at both campuses, whereas physical comorbidities, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with depression among those who studied in armed conflict areas.","Lamaisaard, Y.; Sangsuwan, T.; Chanyeam, K.; Jatchavala, C.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Depression+among+First-Year+University+Students+in+Restive+Areas+of+Southern+Thailand+during+Covid-19+Pandemic","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Suranaree Journal of Science and Technology; 29(5), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40137,""

"COVID-19 in Young Adults and Vaccination","Background: COVID-19 is the evolving pandemic that is still ongoing. There is not much decrease in the extent and impact of COVID-19 even after more than a year has been passed. The younger adults and children are believed to be in danger from possible third wave of COVID-19 in many countries. Summary: Young adults and children have shown great medical resilience in initial phase of the wave. Not much lethal outcome has been reported from podiatric age group. But as novel coronavirus is mutating and changing its working, one must be cautious about the approach. Clinical manifestation is of milder nature among podiatric age group but MIS-C is stinging the containment efforts which are believed to be caused due to COVID-19. Mental health, one of the least discussed medical topics has been highlighted by the impact of the pandemic and should be tackling with professional help. Vaccination divide can be felt and rapid vaccination needs to be done among paediatric age group. Conclusion: There is the need of more study among young adults about clinical manifestation of COVID-19, especially among comorbid patients so that we are well prepared for any eventualities.

"Mental Health Consequences of COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Care Workers","Background: The recent pandemic situation that resulted from the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has had a significant impact on nearly every element of the society. The pandemic has put a lot of danger on the mental and physical wellness of frontline healthcare workers and supporting hospital staffs since they are the sole in charges of the diagnosis and treatment of the COVID-19 infection. According to studies from China, Italy, Turkey, Spain, and Iran, healthcare workers have a higher frequency of having psychological impacts than the overall population. Being a HCW, being a woman, having a lower socioeconomic level, having a greater chance of contracting COVID-19, and social isolation were all common risk factors. On the contrary, having enough medical resources, having up-to-date and accurate knowledge, and having enough medical resources were all protective factors. Objective: This review was primarily centred to look into the prevalence of psychological problems in different types of healthcare workers (doctors, medical residents, nurses, technicians, and public health workers) during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the factors that are linked to the onset of psychological problems in this population during a public health crisis. Methods: Original papers, reviews, preprints, and letters to editors relating to our topic were reviewed using keyword searches in PubMed, Web of Science electronic databases, Asian Journal of Psychiatry. Ten amongst them were finally chosen. This article presents a systemized review of them after extensive and rigorous research. Conclusion: Actions are required to reduce the effects of COVID-19 on mental health by protecting and improving the psychological well-being of healthcare professionals during and after the epidemic. Analysing rates of mood, sleep, and other mental health difficulties is thus a primary priority in order to find moderating factors and tailor therapies.","Bhatt, M.; Wagh, V.; Dhonde, A.; Chakole, S.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Mental+Health+Consequences+of+COVID-19+Pandemic+on+Health+Care+Workers","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Research in Medical and Dental Science; 10(8):77-80, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40142,""

"Impact of infectious disease epidemics on xenophobia: a systematic review","Background: Globally, xenophobia towards out-groups is frequently increased in times of economic and political instability, such as in infectious disease outbreaks. This systematic review aims to: (1) assess the xenophobic attitudes and behaviours towards migrants during disease outbreaks;and (2) identify adverse health outcomes linked to xenophobia. Methods: We searched nine scientific databases to identify studies measuring xenophobic tendencies towards international migrants during disease outbreaks and evaluated the resulting adverse health effects. Results: Eighteen articles were included in the review. The findings were grouped into: 1) xenophobia-related outcomes, including social exclusion, out-group avoidance, support for exclusionary health policies, othering, and germ aversion;and 2) mental health problems, such as anxiety and fear. Depending on the disease outbreak, different migrant populations were negatively affected, particularly Asians, Africans, and Latino people. Factors as perceived vulnerability to disease, disgust sensitivity, medical mistrust individualism, collectivism, disease salience, social representation of disease and beliefs in different origins of disease were associated with xenophobia. Conclusions: Overall, migrants can be a vulnerable population frequently blamed for spreading the disease, promoting irrational fear, worry and stigma in various forms, and leading to health inequities worldwide. It is urgent that societies adopt effective support strategies to combat xenophobia and structural forms of discrimination against migrants.","Silva, TÃ¢nia M.; Alves, Maria, Figueiras, Adolfo, Roque, FÃ¡tima, Herdeiro, Maria T.; Devakumar, Delan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmh.2022.100085","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Migration and Health;: 100085, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40148,""
"Civil engineering studentsâ€™ perceptions of emergency remote teaching: a case study in New Zealand","University of Canterbury, as an institution, had developed strong educational resilience during and after the 2010â€“11 earthquakes. Due to the Coronavirus pandemic, New Zealand shut down all university educational facilities in March 2020, with education migrated online. Within this unique context, this research aims to (1) investigate civil engineering studentsâ€™ perceptions about the benefits and challenges of online learning during the lockdown period, (2) identify significant factors that contribute to effective online teaching and learning, and (3) provide the implications of this research for future emergency remote teaching (ERT). A survey was designed and administered to measure studentsâ€™ perceptions of online learning during the lockdown. A total of 192 completed responses were collected from both undergraduate and Master civil engineering students. In addition to typical online learning challenges, students also experienced unique challenges, such as social and emotional isolation, anxiety, depression, and uncertainty. This paper suggests that teaching presence be brought to the forefront of ERT. Future research directions were recommended to better understand ERT by linking it to the Community of Inquiry framework and enhance tertiary education institutionsâ€™ resilience to handle a future crisis.","Guo, Brian H.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with tension-type headache: A multicenter survey","Background & Objective: Tension-type headache (TTH) is the most common primary headache. TTH worsens quality of life and is related to various psychosocial factors. We aimed to examine the severity of headache (intensity, frequency, and duration), analgesic use, quality of life (QoL), and the impact of COVID pandemic-induced stress in TTH patients. Method(s): TTH cases seen at neurology outpatient clinics in 15 centers in Turkey were included in the study. A questionnaire incorporating sociodemographic and medical information, headache features, sleep quality, general quality of life, and impact of the pandemic event was administered to the subjects. Result(s): A total of 975 TTH patients were evaluated. Headache severity was higher in women as well as in patients with a history of COVID-19 contact. Women, those with chronic diseases, and cases with a COVID-19 contact history had worse perceptions of quality of life and were affected to a greater extent by the pandemic. The factors affecting the impact of the pandemic were female gender and difficulty in access to health services for headache. Co-existing chronic diseases and lost productive time due to headaches were negative determinants for both QoL and the impact of the pandemic. Conclusion(s): Our results show that the COVID pandemic severely worsened the headache burden, quality of life and mental health of TTH patients. These findings can guide us in the clinical approach to TTH cases. Copyright Â© 2022, ASEAN Neurological Association. All rights reserved.","Firat, Y. E.; Karsidag, S.; Neyal, A. M.; Cengiz, E.

"Differences in Physical and Mental Health of Older Adults over the Covid-19 Pandemic from Face-to-Face versus Hybrid Methods","Background/Purpose: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changes in data collection methods have been introduced in research to ensure continuity despite physical distancing and lockdown restrictions. Our objective was to compare differences in physical and mental health of older adults participating in falls research using data collection methods pre-covid-19 pandemic (face-to-face) and during the pandemic (hybrid). Method(s): Individuals aged 60 years and over with at least one fall in the past 12 months, and controls with no history of falls in the past 12 months were recruited. Pre-pandemic, individuals were interviewed face-to-face exclusively, those interviews after the start of the pandemic were conducted virtually with physical assessments conducted face-to-face to minimize physical contact. Cognitive status, physical performance, psychological status, quality of life, physical activity, and social participation were measured. Result(s): Of the 145 participants of similar socio-demographic backgrounds, 69 were interviewed face-to-face, while 76 were assessed using a hybrid method. Differences were observed in presence of fall characteristics, with fewer fallers seeing a doctor and more fallers attending the emergency department after the start of the pandemic. After adjustment for baseline differences, participants interviewed using hybrid status had lower depression scores (OR (95%CI)=0.29(0.14-0.61)) and stress scores (OR(95%CI)=0.33(0.15-0.72)), but greater fear of falling (OR(95%CI)=2.16(1.04-4.48)) and reduced social participation (OR(95%CI)=2.64(1.20-5.79)). Conclusion(s): Alterations in data collection methods to overcome pandemic restrictions should take into consideration potential differences in individuals who agree to participate as well as the influence of major life events on the psychological status of participants.

"Effect of selected factors related to emotions and general health on the health behaviours of paramedics","Introduction and Objective. Lifestyle and its related health behaviour are significant factors affecting health. The aim of this study was to define a selection of factors influencing the health behaviour of paramedics from the Masovian Province, the biggest in Poland. Materials and method. The study group consisted of paramedics employed in Emergency Response Teams (ERT) on the territory of Masovian Province. The study involved 238 participants: 223 men and 15 women. The mean age of the participants was 39.03Â±9.27 years for males, and 31.93Â±7.76 years for females. The research was carried out between May 2019 â€“ September 2019 using the diagnostic survey method, including Jurczynskiâ€™s Health Behaviour Inventory (HBI), Courtauldâ€™s Emotional Control Scale (CECS) and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28). Results. The health behaviours of the participants were defined as average. The probability of exhibiting proper health behaviours increases with age (OR=2.178, 95% Cl: 1.030â€“4.604;p 0,042), the ability to control emotions, especially on the depressive mood scale, (OR=0.901, 95% Cl: 0.827â€“0.981;p 0.017) and the general health condition, i.e., the less anxiety or insomnia the participating paramedics experience, the higher the chance of them exhibiting proper health behaviours (OR =0.809, 95% Cl: 0.725â€“0.903;p 0.000) or not experiencing social dysfunction (OR=0.760, 95% Cl: 0.628â€“0.920;p 0.005). Conclusions. As an occupational group, paramedics require help from their employers and other specialists in the fostering of proper health behaviour in order to experience a good quality of life in the workplace and beyond. Educative measures have to be undertaken in the paramedic population, especially with regard to ameliorating eating habits, handling stress, burnout prophylaxis, and counteracting musculo-skeletal disorders.","Gonczaryk, A.; Chmielewski, J.

"Mental Health and COVID-19: Symptom Prevalence, Sociodemographic Associations, and Implications for Practice","The COV1D-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on mental health. The current study examined symptoms of depression and anxiety and sociodemographic factors associated with increased symptoms among 1,242 adults under the same state-issued stay-at-home mandate. Mean anxiety and depression scores were 58.07 Â± 9.6 and 55.18 Â± 10.49, with the majority of participants indicating clinically significant symptoms of anxiety (n = 831, 66.90%) and depression (n = 652, 52.49%). African American and Latino/a American participants, individuals under the age of 45, and unemployed individuals or persons working in professional jobs presented with the most significant risk for adverse outcomes.

"Not Your Fetish: Broaching Racialized Sexual Harassment Against Asian Women","Asian women's paradoxical position of hypervisbility and invisibility is a result of society caricaturing and fetishizing their sexuality and bodies while simultaneously denying their humanity and personhood. Despite the long history of objectification and fetishization of Asian women in the United States, extant mental health counseling training programs and literature offer limited guidance to counselors on this concern, perpetuating an epistemic lapse in mental health counselors' competency. With rising anti-Asian hate, the racialized COVID-19 pandemic, and anti-Chinese sentiment in the United States, there exist increased threats to Asian women's mental health. Responding to a paucity of counseling literature, this article offers strategies grounded in the multidimensional model of broaching behavior to broach racialized sexual harassment experienced by Asian women. Implications for counselor training and future research are also offered.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on childhood obesity â€“ the need to implement an obesity prevention programme","Obesity is a chronic disease that can lead to medical and psychological complications, including cardiovascular diseases, impaired glucose tolerance, chronic inflammations and visceral fatness. Obesity and sedentary lifestyle affect the morphology of osteochondral structures and the growth plate, leading to serious orthopaedic consequences. The stigma of obese children also increases the rates of anxiety disorders, depression and learning disabilities in the paediatric population. The COVID-19 pandemic has enforced the introduction of isolation rules, changing the living conditions of society. Working and studying remotely and keeping social contacts to a minimum resulted in a lower intensity of physical activity and altered eating habits, which significantly contributed to further weight gain in overweight and obese children. In the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus infection, organic changes associated with obesity may increase the risk of thromboembolism, reduce the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys and increase the inflammatory response of the body, which may consequently lead to invasive mechanical ventilation. Previous studies on obesity in children have shown that a high inflammatory index increases the risk of long-term complications in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and reduces the chances of a quick recovery. It is necessary to make the society aware of the extent of health complications of childhood obesity, introduce social education on the principles of nutrition, and facilitate access to holistic treatment for obesity. All tasks in the field of obesity prevention and treatment have been developed as part of the prevention programme.","Kocieba-Laciak, Anita","https://doi.org/10.15557/PiMR.2022.0017","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Paediatrics and Family Medicine; 18(2):125-125â€“129, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40162,""
"HERBAL EXTRACTS USED AS COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINES (CAM) FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY-RELATED DISORDERS","Stress disorders are the most frequent type of mental disease. They are less noticeable than depression and schizophrenia, yet they are just incapacitating. This article presents a descriptive analysis of anxiety disorders, their types, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, control, and it also unfolds the mode of action of drugs, herbal agents, therapies and, physical activity for the management of these disorders. Even though there are effective pharmacological and psychological treatments for stress disorders, many individuals who are affected do not seek treatment, and of those who do, the vast majority are misdiagnosed or do not receive cutting-edge treatment. The prevalence rates do not appear to have altered in recent years. These disorders have a lot of comorbidities.Due to the side effects and unbearable cost of medication/therapy, there is a growing trend of the use of herbal drugs and physical exercises for the treatment of anxiety mainly after covid-19. Psychopharmacological and cognitive behavioral therapies can be used for better treatment;For example, the ABC model is a dynamic model of anxiety that can help us understand the interactions between the processes that cause symptoms to emerge and persist throughout time, as well as the biological and psychological elements that influence them. Rational combinations of these tactics should be investigated further to boost future outcomes.","Wal, P.; Gupta, K.; Singh, Y.; Wal, A.; Kumar, S.; Saxena, B.","https://doi.org/10.14704/nq.2022.20.10.NQ55837","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: NeuroQuantology; 20(10):8522-8533, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40163,""
"An analysis COVID-19's Examining Effects on Mental Health from a Psychological Perspective","In socially challenging circumstances, a person's personality pathologies that have roots in the distant past are typically intensified, and the covert collective mentality of society as a whole emerges. The COVID-19 epidemic, which has caused a severe level of crisis throughout the world, gives us a chance to more clearly see social pathologies in addition to personal diseases, which aids in our understanding of the meanings of the pathologies. The COVID-19 outbreak's effects on Japanese people's views and behaviors as a whole were discussed in this study. For discussing various behavioral phenomena, such as addiction behaviors and crude criticism and/or discrimination towards a certain type of people, psychoanalytic, social psychology, and self-determination theories were utilized.

"A STUDY TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON MENTAL HEALTH IN PSYCHIATRIC PATIENTS OF VARIOUS RACES","People suffering from severe mental illness (SMI) have a significant negative impact on their communities as compared to the normal population. There are a variety of factors that contribute to the majority of this excess mortality. It is reported in this paper on a study that was conducted to explore the impact on mental health among psychiatric patients all over the world. We were able to determine the prevalence rates as well as the factors that contributed to the elevated morbidity and mortality rates. There is evidence that increased risk for the majority of physical diseases is caused by a combination of lifestyle variables as well as treatment-specific risk factors. There is also adequate data to imply that people with SMI are less likely than the general population to obtain normal levels of care for the majority of illnesses than the general population. The current period of Covid 19 demonstrates the enormous amount of mental stress experienced by health practitioners all across the world. A range of mental health disorders are caused by the pandemic, which is particularly widespread among psychiatric patients due to the unusual nature of the outbreak. Psychiatric patients are frequently affected by anxiety, depression, burnout, insomnia, and other stress-related diseases, according to the American Academy of Family Physicians (Freudenberger, H). It is the purpose of this study, as well as other low-resource countries, to draw attention to the mental health aspects of the pandemic among psychiatric patients.","Chouhan, D. S.; Joseph, P.

"Influence of Covid 19 on cognition impairment with Type II diabetes","Background: Due to the increase in life expectancy and population growth over 65 years, cognitive impairment (CI) is gradually increasing. Because of many changes in the human brain that occur with aging, cognitive decline usually worsens with age. The number of neurons, dendrites, synapses, receptors, glial components, and critical neurotransmitters (norepinephrine, dopamine, acetylcholine) diminishes every year after age 50 (by 0.1â€“0.2 percent). As a result, the brain's volume, metabolism, and perfusion decrease, and an average age-related cognitive decline emerge. Objective: This review will elucidate the underlying factors mediating the interaction of COVID-19, diabetes, and mental health, which may provide essential clues for tailored intervention for this vulnerable population. Result: As per the World Alzheimer Report, 46.8 million individuals worldwide suffered from dementia in 2015, a figure that's still expected to quadruple every 20 years. During the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers and practitioners are becoming increasingly concerned about the emergence of neurological symptoms, particularly the development of cognitive impairment. Learning, memory, flexible thinking, concentration, and executive function are all cognitive functions. Examples of executive functions include understanding a specific problem, solving problems, judging, halting, or modifying old behaviors, and initiating new ones. When patients are required to complete complex tasks, such as changing their insulin dose, predicting the effects of physical exercise on blood glucose, or even diagnosing and treating appropriate hypoglycemia, all these behavioral reactions are critical. Conclusion: Cognitive problems impair a patient's capacity to carry out several treatment measures, such as adhering to a medical regimen and recognizing signs of deterioration, all of which compromise the patient's treatment compliance. The current review focuses on the state of cognitive functioning in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus at the time of diagnosis and following COVID-19.","Putta, V.

"COVID-19 loss of taste and smell: potential psychological repercussions","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has become a cause for global concern. Apart from a multitude of symptoms, the virus is known for its ability to cause loss of taste and smell that can be irreversible in a few cases. In fact, even after recovery, post-covid syndrome can still lead to devastating outcomes, specifically with reference to loss of smell and taste. A number of mechanisms that have been postulated include receptor-mediated uptake, increased inflammation, transneuronal migration, and direct damage to the olfactory pathway. Considering how important these two senses are, many psychological, social, and emotional repercussions can be expected. These repercussions include lowering of self-esteem and developmental of mental health issues. Long-term altered taste sensation can also lead to the development of unhealthy eating habits that can result in increasing risk for diabetes and hypertension. A few solutions have been investigated for treating these chemosensory dysfunctions, such as olfactory training, corticosteroids, theophylline and acupuncture. Although the results have been promising but a new modality, virtual reality, requires more in-depth exploration because it targets not only the dysfunction but also the mental health issues being experienced. It is important that affected individuals be provided with strong emotional and family support. Additionally, physicians can help the patients through support groups, cognitive behavioural therapy, olfactory, and virtual reality training.","Javed, N.; Ijaz, Z.; Khair, A. H.; Dar, A.

"Knowledge, Attitude, Practices and Risk of Psychological Distress among Frontline Healthcare Workers Towards COVID-19 in Second Wave","Introduction: Frontline Healthcare Workers (F-HCWs) are at the front position for medical care against Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which has life-threatening potentials. Poor level of knowledge, practices and negative attitudes as well as high-risk of psychological distress among F-HCWs can directly lead to delayed diagnosis, treatment and poor infection control practices. Aim: To assess the level of Knowledge, Attitude and Practices (KAP) as well as risk of psychological distress among F-HCWs for COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and Methods: This descriptive, hospital-based, cross-sectional study was conducted at Government Medical College, Azamgarh, Uttar Pradesh, India, located in tertiary care centre in rural area) from October 2021 to December 2021 among 223 F-HCWs using convenient sampling technique. To assess the level of KAP as well as risk of psychological distress among F-HCWs a prevalidated structured questionnaire was used consisting 15 knowledge questions, six attitude questions, 15 practices questions and six questions on risk of psychological distress. Chi-square test was performed to examine the association between risk of psychological distress and level of KAP as well as with demographic characteristics of F-HCWs. Results: Out of total 223 participants more than half of physicians (52.9%) and one-third of staff nurses (35.9%) were from age group of 25-35 years, respectively. Majority of both physicians (57.1%) and staff nurses (87.6%) were married and had nuclear type of family as of 64.3% and 74.5%, respectively. Most of the physicians (92.9%) had good level of knowledge but they had less positive attitude (84.3%) compare to staff nurses (92.8%). Majority of both physicians (64.3%) and staff nurses (58.2%) had no or low risk of psychological distress while only few of them had its high level.

"Advancing Pulmonary Rehabilitation Approach in Improving Well-being in a Long COVID-19 Syndrome Case","Being a highly contagious disease, Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has shown its impact throughout the world. Clinical manifestations are seen primarily involving the respiratory system. Fever, cough, fatigue, and breathlessness are the commonly seen symptoms. Several cases of COVID-19 manifest as viral pneumonia-induced Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). COVID-19 symptoms appear not only during the course of the illness but also as its after effects. Long COVID-19 is said to be multisystem syndrome, categorised as postacute or chronic depending upon the time frame. It is characterized by the presence of symptoms beyond four weeks of the actual disease. Change in structural components in the lung leads to having a functional consequence on the body, affecting the cognitive, psychosocial, mental and physical well-being of the patients. Studies have shown alveolar damage same as ARDS. The most common pulmonary sequences seen are dyspnoea, cough (dry/with expectoration) and decreased diffusion capacity leading to reduced endurance. The present case report was of a 45-year-old nurse, who presented with the symptoms of postacute long COVID-19. Her previous scan of thorax showed a severity score of 11/25 after being tested COVID-19 positive. In view of the presenting complaints, a tailor-made pulmonary rehabilitation program was administered which showed great improvement in overall health condition. This case had been reported to document the effects of post COVID rehabilitation program on aspects such as functional capacity, quality of life, anxiety and depression using novel measures such as Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (ISWT), World Health Organisation Quality of Life-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 Items (DASS-21). Rehabilitation has been proven to be effective and safe in improving the exercise performance, quality of life affected due to COVID-19 and psychological function of the patients.

"Continued Mentorship Program for MBBS Students during COVID-19 Pandemic in Virtual Mode: A Questionnaire-based Observational Study","Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic situation propelled the regular student mentorship program onto a virtual mode. Various surveys and studies have uncovered the ramifications on mental health and academic upheaval caused by the changing academic regulations and protocols. Aim(s): To evaluate the perception of mentors and mentees regarding the utility of virtual mentorship and to deduce barriers in continuing virtual mode mentorship program for 1st-year medical students. Material(s) and Method(s): The present observational study was conducted at Sri Siddhartha Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Centre, from April-June 2020. A feedback form was administered to all participants after two months of the online mentorship program, via a semistructured questionnaire. The questionnaire had four open and eight close-ended responses for mentees. The contents were related to the frequency of meetings, mode of communication, perceived barriers, and futility of course, along with one open and five close-ended responses for mentors on barriers to effective conduct and perceived level of the mentoring relationship forged with students. A total of 12 mentors and 125 students responded. Result(s): It was observed that 96% of mentees felt that the program helped to fight alienation and stay connected, 89.6% felt inspired to study and 83% felt oriented to the online teaching programs. Both 91.7% of mentors and 82.4% of mentees asked for better applications, connectivity, and network support. In fact, the major barrier to effective communication was quoted as being poor network connectivity and applications support (47%). A comparable trend was noted among both mentees and mentors with respect to the program being rated good and above (91.7% mentors and 85.6% mentees). Hence, in the observational study, via thematic analysis and content analysis of qualitative data, two points were observed-1. The virtual mentorship program helped mentees to get emotionally and academically connected, cleared their doubts, and helped to reduce stress. 2. Poor technical and connectivity support were deduced as major barriers to the successful conduct of virtual mentorship. Conclusion(s): A well-structured virtual mentorship program guides the mentors to effectively chaperone mentees through a stressful uninterrupted academic course period, enhance academic performances and help alleviate the feeling of alienation.

"Psychosomatic rehabilitation in pandemic times: A multi-perspective assessment of COVID-related measures and their associations with key outcome parameters, rehabilitation satisfaction, and rehabilitation success","Background: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is a global crisis with massive effects on all areas of society, such as the labor market, social security systems, and healthcare. It represents a complex stress situation that hardly leaves anyone unscathed. As a result, a significant increase in mental stress and ill- ness has been observed since the beginning of the pandemic. The coronavirus pandemic almost paralyzed rehabilitation in the spring of 2020. When comparing the 1st quarter of 2019 with that of 2021 (cumulative), a decrease of â€“32.8% is recorded for 2021 in the applications for services for medical rehabilitation (total 2020 to 2019: â€“14.2%). For the rehabilitation centers, the central and vital question is under which conditions rehabilitation measures can be carried out safely and successfully even in times of a pandemic. This also includes the confi-dence of potential rehabilitation patients, referring physicians, and employees in the structural and procedural measures taken by the centers. Materials and methods: The study aims to shed light on the effects and coping attempts of the pandemic in medical rehabilitation from different perspectives and to provide indications for routine care in â€œCOVID normal operationâ€. The focus is on a comparative analysis of the results of the routine survey in the period October 2019 to June 2020, interviews with the management level of the center as well as a cat-amnestic follow-up survey of rehabilitation patients who completed a psychosomatic rehabilitation measure in the center in the period January to September 2020. Results: The interviews at the management level and the analysis of the safety concept show that a crisis team was installed at a very early stage in the center and a safety concept was established, which met with a high level of acceptance among all participants and contributed to a feeling of safety. The comparison of the routine survey shows that, with the exception of individual cases, the rehabilitation measures were carried out and completed according to plan. In most areas, the ratings have even improved in the 1st half of 2020 compared to the 4th quarter of 2019. The results of the catamnestic survey confirm the results of the routine survey. The rehabilitation patients who were treat-ed at the Rehazentrum Bad Bocklet during the COVID pandemic showed pronounced psychosomatic and participation-related limitations in the period before or at admis-sion. Regarding concerns and fears about the COVID situation, almost half of all respondents stated strong or very strong fears about the effects of the COVID pandemic on personal or close persons. In the foreground are fears that a close person could become infected or die. The hospitalâ€™s safety measures in terms of hygiene and adapted struc-tures and processes were rated positively by around three quarters of respondents. This is also confirmed by the results of the outcome parameters examined. The personal therapy goals were achieved for about three quarters of the respondents. Positive chang-es were seen in terms of health, health com-plaints, anxiety and depression symptoms, global health and the development of the ability to work, among other things. The RTW rates are 71% (time point method) and 81% (cumulative time course). The benefit of the rehabilitation measure is rated as high by 73% of the respondents is the treatment satisfaction. Substantial influences of rehab motivation, admission periods, and percep-tion and evaluation of COVID measures at the center on key outcome parameters are shown. These results emphasize the role of appropriate safety and hygiene measures adapted to the current hazard situation in the context of rehabilitation measures. The results indicate that the hospital succeeded in implementing suitable measures right at the beginning of the pandemic, and in com-municating and living these measures ac-cordingly. In addition, they allow the conclu-sion that under suitable safety and hygiene conditions, rehabilitation measures can also be carried out safely in times of pandem c and still show stable effects in essential tar-get criteria of medical rehabilitation after one year.","Kaiser, U.; NÃ¼bling, R.; Schmidt, J.; Jorkowski, J.; Geier, A.; ReuÃŸ-Borst, M.","https://doi.org/10.5414/PRX0572","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Pravention und Rehabilitation; 34(3):81-99, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40172,""

Material(s) and Method(s): A questionnaire consisting of 16 questions was conducted to 510 healthcare professionals working in Inegol State Hospital between December 2021-January 2022 and who agreed to participate in the study, to determine their approach to the COVID-19 vaccine. The data were collected with Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U Test. Chi-square test was used in comparison of categorical variables. Result(s): While 54.3% of the respondents said that they don't want to have the COVID-19 vaccine, 69% answered that ""Since there is not any adequate research on the vaccine, the vaccine is not reliable"". Were observed that vaccine rejection was most common in the 20-29 age group (72.7%) and pregnant women (100%). In addition, as the education level increased, the number of people considering vaccination increased. The desire to be vaccinated was seen more in married, and it was noted that non-smokers had more COVID-19 (80.3%). Conclusion(s): Healthcare professionals who participated in study were found to have a negative attitude towards COVID-19 vaccine. Although healthcare professionals have hesitations about vaccine, in fact, noteworthy that they're afraid of the disease (43.8%). Despite of the pandemic, more than half (54.3%) of healthcare professionals working in Inegol State Hospital stated that they didn't think about getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

"Attitudes of Physicians and Nurses in Oman Toward Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccination","To investigate the relationship between attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and disapproval of the policy of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination among unvaccinated physicians and nurses in Oman. The subjects were (N = 346) unvaccinated physicians and nurses in Oman. Their demographic data and attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccines and mandatory vaccination policy were collected through an anonymous web-based survey and statistically analyzed. The participants' negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines were positively related (r = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001) to the extent of their non-support for COVID-19 mandatory vaccination policy. Analysis of variance test showed that after controlling for age, male healthcare providers were more likely to endorse mandating COVID-19 vaccinations. There was no difference between physicians and nurses in support of mandatory vaccination, after controlling for age. Regardless of job type, male, and older physicians, and nurses in Oman were more supportive of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination than their younger and female counterparts. This research provides insights from an Arabian Gulf country about the attitudes of its unvaccinated healthcare providers toward compulsory COVID-19 vaccination.","Badahdah, Abdallah M.; Al Mahyijari, Nawal, Badahdah, Ryan, Al Lawati, Furqan, Khamis, Faryal","https://doi.org/10.5001/omj.2022.87","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Oman medical journal; 37(5):e429, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40174,""

"Ethical and legal issues concerning COVID 19 vaccinations in persons with mental illness in India","Mental healthcare in India faces severe challenges amid the ongoing pandemic. India runs the largest vaccination drive globally, including booster doses to rapidly vaccinate its population of over a billion. As persons with mental illness are at greater risk of adverse outcomes from COVID 19, they need prioritized access and administration of these vaccines. This manuscript examines the current legislation and identifies how the legal and ethical frameworks can prioritize COVID 19 vaccinations for persons with mental illness in India through a review of the various legislations of India concerning persons with mental illness and judicial judgments concerning the pandemic and vaccination. Subsequently, we discuss ethical and legal challenges associated with vaccination in this vulnerable population and possible solutions. Based on the current review, the authors recommend the guidelines for capacity assessment for vaccination decisions and discuss existing legal frameworks relevant to the vaccination of persons with mental illness.","Sharad, Philip, Satish, Suhas, Nirisha, P.; Pandey, Praveen, Narayana, Manjunatha, Kumar, Channaveerachari, Math, Suresh","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_228_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 31(2):183-190, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40176,""
"A cross-sectional survey of sleep patterns and quality and its association with psychological symptoms among doctors working in a COVID-19 care facility","Context: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has led to several psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of which sleep disturbances are common. Stress due to isolation and disease-related factors are known to be associated with sleep disturbances. Aim: The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of poor sleep and its association with psychological symptoms among doctors working in COVID-19 tertiary hospital. Settings and Design: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 150 doctors who were treating COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: The survey contained a semi-structured questionnaire including sociodemographic details, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scale. Analysis was done using the SPSS v20. Results: Of 150 doctors, we found 67 (44.67%) and 83 (55.33%) doctors were poor sleepers and good sleepers, respectively. Those who were married (P = 0.001), had higher working hours per month (P = 0.001), the presence of family history of psychiatric illness (P = 0.008), and history of substance use (P = 0.007) were associated with poor sleep. Furthermore, poor sleep was associated with higher stress (P = 0.001), anxiety (P = 0.001), and depression (P = 0.001). A multiple logistic regression revealed that family history of psychiatric illness (odds ratio [OR]-5.44, P = 0.01) and the presence of substance use (OR-7.77, P = 0.01) predicted poor sleep. Conclusion: Sleep pattern abnormalities were present in 45% of the frontline COVID-19 doctors studied. Family history of psychiatric illness and substance use was associated with higher chances of having poor sleep. It is important to recognize and manage sleep abnormalities as these could be initial signs of a psychiatric disorder or manifestations of underlying stress, especially in the vulnerable population.","Kota, Sushmitha, Kumar, Shankar, Gopal, Archana, Rudra, Prashanth, Anvitha, K.","https://doi.org/10.4103/ipj.ipj_142_21","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Industrial Psychiatry Journal; 31(2):262-266, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40177,""
"Psychological distress among first-year medical students amidst COVID-19-related uncertainty at a medical college in Western India: A cross-sectional study","Background: The sudden and rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created fear, worry and uncertainty in the student community. First-year medical students are likely to be doubly affected, for in addition to the stress of adapting to new learning processes, they are also now faced with uncertainties due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was therefore decided to estimate psychological distress among the 1st-year medical students among the COVID-19 pandemic-related uncertainty. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1st-year medical students studying at a Medical College in western India. Demographic and COVID-19 related data was collected from the students through Google Forms and psychological distress was measured by using the 20 point World Health Organization-Self Reporting Questionnaire (WHO-SRQ 20). The study was approved by the Institutional ethics committee. Informed consent was taken before administering the questionnaire to the study participants. Statistical analysis was conducted using the SPSS statistical software. Results: Prevalence of Psychological distress among the study participants by WHO-SRQ 20 Scale with cut off 7/8 as found to be 25.5%. Worried about themselves contracting COVID-19 Infection (odds ratio [OR]: 3.44;95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25â€“9.42), worried of the adverse financial effect on self and family due to COVID-19 pandemic (OR: 3.01;95% CI: 1.29â€“7.04), worried that online mode of learning was putting them at disadvantage compared to traditional Teaching-Learning method (OR: 3.44;95% CI: 1.25â€“9.42), and worried about adverse effects on social support due to COVID-19 pandemic (OR: 2.63;95% CI: 1.27â€“5.43), were the factors significantly associated with psychological distress among the medical students. Discussion: There is an urgent need to develop a system to render counseling/professional help to all the students in need. This would ensure better mental health and would minimize any adverse academic outcomes among the students due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.","Shyadligeri, Anish, Vaz, Frederick, Lokapure, Sudeep","https://doi.org/10.4103/efh.efh_612_20","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Education for Health; 35(1):20-25, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40178,""
"Changes in Diagnostic and Demographic Characteristics of Patients Seeking Mental Health Care During the Early COVID-19 Pandemic in a Large, Community-Based Health Care System","Objective: The early COVID-19 pandemic resulted in great psychosocial disruption and stress, raising speculation that psychiatric disorders may worsen. This study aimed to identify patients vulnerable to worsening mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method(s): This retrospective observational study used electronic health records from March 9 to May 31 in 2019 (n = 94,720) and 2020 (n = 94,589) in a large, community-based health care system. Percent change analysis compared variables standardized to the average patient population for the respective time periods. Result(s): Compared to 2019, psychiatric visits increased significantly (P &lt; .0001) in 2020, with the majority being telephone/video-based (+264%). Psychiatric care volume increased overall (7%), with the greatest increases in addiction (+42%), behavioral health in primary care (+17%), and adult psychiatry (+5%) clinics. While patients seeking care with preexisting psychiatric diagnoses were mainly stable (-2%), new patients declined (-42%). Visits for substance use (+51%), adjustment (+15%), anxiety (+12%), bipolar (+9%), and psychotic (+6%) disorder diagnoses, and for patients aged 18-25 years (+4%) and 26-39 years (+4%), increased. Child/adolescent and older adult patient visits decreased (-22.7% and -5.5%, respectively), and fewer patients identifying as White (-3.8%) or male (-5.0) or with depression (-3%) or disorders of childhood (-2%) sought care. Conclusion(s): The early COVID-19 pandemic was associated with dramatic changes in psychiatric care facilitated by a rapid telehealth care transition. Patient volume, demographic, and diagnostic changes may reflect comfort with telehealth or navigating the psychiatric care system. These data can inform health system resource management and guide future work examining how care delivery changes impact psychiatric care quality and access.

"Prevalence Anxiety Family Members of Patients Admitted to Inpatient Hospital Room during Pandemic COVID-19","BACKGROUND: Anxiety is confusion or worry about something that is not certain with unclear causes, causing feelings of uncertainty and powerlessness over the assessment of an object. Based on data at Izza Hospital, the number of patients who were hospitalized in July was 427 patients. The increasing number of patients in inpatient rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic caused psychological shocks to family members which caused anxiety. AIM: The purpose of this study was to find out the description of family anxiety in the inpatient room during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The design of this research is descriptive analytic with a cross-sectional approach. The population of this study was the entire family of patients who were treated in inpatient rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a total sample of 96 respondents using a consecutive sampling technique. This study used a visual analog scale for anxiety (VAS-A) questionnaire to measure the respondentsâ€™ level of anxiety. RESULTS: The results of this study showed that the patientâ€™s family in the hospital inpatient room experienced mild anxiety 42 respondents (43.8%), with an average age of 40-44 years (n = 18;0.19%), female gender (n = 51;0.53), respondentsâ€™ education (n = 53;0.55), work (n = 57;0.6), nuclear family (n = 83;0.09).

"The Indonesian Governmentâ€™s Regulation on the Management of COVID-19 Hazardous Medical Waste from Health Service Facilities and Self-Isolation Activities","BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 entered Indonesia in January 2020, though the government first announced its entrance on March 2, 2020. This pandemic has affected this country for more than 2 years, and it has caused many casualties and material losses. The Indonesia government still undergoes efforts to prevent the spread of this disease. One of its medium of infection is COVID-19 medical waste. It is estimated that Indonesia produces 138 tons of COVID-19 medical waste daily, with limited management capabilities. AIM: This research aims to describe the Indonesian governmentâ€™s policies or regulations on the acceleration in handling the COVID-19 pandemic, by cutting the chain of infection through the management of hazardous and toxic waste, namely, the medical waste from health service facilities and self-isolation activities of COVID-19 sufferers. METHOD: This research uses the doctrinal approach. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: It is shown that the Indonesian governmentâ€™s regulations are well-prepared. However, due to the quick spread of the virus, the government needed to issue different regulations several times to adapt to the situation in the field. After sometime, the vaccination program has reached the target and the quantity of the spread has decreased. Thus, the government issued new policies on the status of the COVID-19 medical waste from the category of hazardous and toxic waste into common domestic waste.","Subadi, S.","https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2022.9425","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences; 10:1637-1641, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40181,""
"Evolution of BIM to DTs: A Paradigm Shift for the Post-Pandemic AECO Industry","The architecture, engineering, construction, and operation (AECO) industry is evolving rapidly. In particular, technological advancements and lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic are shaping the industry's future. Various artificial intelligence (AI), building information modeling (BIM), and Internet of Things (IoT) techniques have contributed to the industry's modernization by enabling more self-reliable, self-automated, self-learning, time-saving, and cost-effective processes throughout the various life cycle phases of a smart building or city. As a result, the concept of digital twins (DTs) has recently emerged as a potential solution to optimize the AECO sector to achieve the required cyber-physical integration, particularly following the pandemic. Based on a systematic review, the study develops and proposes theoretical models that examine the evolution of DTs in the context of BIM, cutting-edge technologies, platforms, and applications throughout the project's life cycle phases. This study demonstrates DTs' high potential as a comprehensive approach to planning, managing, predicting, and optimizing AECO projects that will achieve more Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, while DTs offer many new opportunities, they also pose technical, societal, and operational challenges that must be addressed.","Megahed, Naglaa A.; Hassan, Asmaa M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6040067","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Urban Science; 6(4):67, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40182,""
"COVID-19 Lockdown Stress and the Mental Health of College Students: A Cross-Sectional Survey in China","To prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world adopted varying degrees of lockdown. The lockdowns restricted the freedom of college students, which led to stress and mental health issues. This study constructed a mediating model to explore the relationship between COVID-19 lockdown stress and Chinese college studentsâ€™ mental health;the mediating role of fear of missing out (FoMO) was also investigated. A 7-item COVID-19 student stress questionnaire (CSSQ), a 6-item mental health scale, and a 10-item FoMO scale were distributed among 695 college students who experienced lockdown in China. The results showed that COVID-19 lockdown stress was significantly and negatively correlated with mental health, significantly and positively correlated with FoMO, and FoMO was significantly and negatively correlated with mental health. COVID-19 lockdown stress significantly and negatively influenced Chinese college studentsâ€™ mental health directly and indirectly via the complementary partial mediating effect of FoMO. The results intensify our comprehension of the influence of COVID-19 lockdown stress and mental health problems in Chinese college students and also provide practical suggestions for college educators to address such scenarios.","Hu, Ziao, Li, Jun, Pan, Ling, Zhang, Xiaoying","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912923","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(19):12923, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40183,""
"Efficacy of Online-Based Intervention for Anxiety during COVID-19: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","COVID-19 has caused widespread psychological suffering. Anxiety is one of the several psychological disorders that are escalating globally, yet social distance constraints restrict in-person mental health therapy. Anxiety and other psychological disorders whose treatments are limited due to social distancing continue to grow, so there is an increasing need to use mental healthcare that can be offered remotely, especially in the pandemic era. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the efficacy of online-based interventions for anxiety during COVID-19. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA). We collected data from three databases, namely PubMed, CINAHL, and Oxford Library Press, published in 2020â€“2022. Additionally, we collected data using the snowball technique. This meta-analysis analyzed the pooled mean difference (MD) and its p-value using random-effects models. Critical appraisal and risk of bias were assessed using Cochrane Risk of Bias (Rob) 2. We retrieved 34 RCTs for systematic review and 14 RCTs for meta-analysis, yielding 9159 participants for general anxiety disorder (GAD-7) measurement and 1303 participants for depression anxiety stress scale (DASS-21) measurement. This study shows that online-based interventions significantly reduce GAD-7 score (a pooled MD of 1.30;95% CI: 2.83â€“4.65;p = 0.00001) and insignificantly reduce DASS-21 (0.05;95% CI: -2.63â€“2.72;p = 0.97) according to pre- and post-test in intervention group. Additionally, there is a significant difference between the intervention and control groups, where the intervention group performed statistically progressively better than the controls (-7.26;95% CI: -11.58â€“-2.95;p = 0.001) (-2.08;95% CI: -6.71â€“2.55;p = 0.001). Online-based interventions have proved effective for reducing general anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Commercial Real Estate Market at a Crossroads: The Impact of COVID-19 and the Implications to Future Cities","This paper aims to examine the responses of commercial real estate markets to COVID-19 and the implications for post-pandemic cities. Using data of Floridaâ€™s metropolitan areas in a fixed effect regression model, we find that sales volumes of retail properties decline instantly under the shock of COVID-19 but are followed by a strong recovery after one quarter. Meanwhile, COVID-19 depresses the growth rate of rent for office property, but the impact is short-term, and the office rental market bounces back to about 70 percent one quarter later. In comparison, industrial properties witness a rise in the growth rate of sales and rent price.

"Analyst Earnings Forecast Optimism during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Evidence from China","Analysts are important participants in the capital market, but there are relatively few studies on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on analysts' behaviors. This article examines the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the analysts' earnings forecast optimism by using a sample of visits to Chinese listed firms during 2019&ndash;2020. We find that the analysts' earnings forecasts become less optimistic and show pessimism after the outbreak of COVID-19. This result is consistent with past research findings that major natural disasters lead to analysts' forecasts pessimism. However, we also find that the earnings forecasts issued by analysts with on-site visits are more optimistic after the COVID-19 outbreak. The increase in optimism is associated with accounting information transparency, the proportion of tangible assets, and the revenue geographical concentration of the visited companies. Further analysis shows that higher optimism in visiting analysts' earnings forecasts after the COVID-19 outbreak leads to a positive market response, suggesting that optimism in visiting analysts' forecasts misleads the market's resource allocation. We also find that the higher level of optimism in visiting analysts' earnings forecasts disappeared after the COVID-19 outbreak was well controlled. Overall, our study enriches the study of the impact of COVID-19 on capital markets from the perspective of analysts' forecast optimism. Investors in other countries should also be aware of the impact of similar phenomena.","Yu, Yan","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912758","","Database: MDPI; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(19):12758, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40186,""
"Well-Being during the Pandemicâ€“Insights from a Rapid Review on the Mental Health of Disadvantaged Youth and Young Adults","The spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had a wide range of impacts on living conditions, opportunities and mental health. As discussed by society and supported by some studies, young people were particularly affected. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of research that explicitly addressed the mental health outcomes of adolescentsâ€™ and young adultsâ€™ transition. A systematic literature search in PubMed, PsycInfo, PSYNDEX, Embase and LIVIVO was conducted in February 2022. 42 of 2562 screened publications from industrialized/high-income countries were included and analyzed. All included publications show that the mental health of young people worsened during the pandemic. Several studies suggest(ed) that youths with less education and low socioeconomic status were affected most. Regarding different stages of adolescence, study results are heterogeneous. Evidence indicates that schools as institutions are important settings for everyday lives, personal development and education of young people. The review shows that there is a need for research and scientifically validated recommendations for practice. Further consideration should focus on the implementation of sustainable structures on the local level to strengthen resilience, minimize risk factors for young peopleâ€™s mental health and create opportunities for valuable transitions.","Kuchler, Maja, Beckmann, Saskia, Habig, Celine, Heid, Karen, Rademaker, Anna Lena, Quilling, Eike","https://doi.org/10.3390/su141912730","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Sustainability; 14(19):12730, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40187,""
"Adaptation and Validation of a Monkeypox Concern Instrument in Peruvian Adults","Monkeypox is causing great concern in society because of its great infective power and the possibility that it could become a new pandemic. This study aimed to adapt and validate the monkeypox concern scale in the Peruvian adult population (EP-VIR-MONK). An instrumental cross-sectional study was carried out under a non-probabilistic convenience sampling with 779 adults from the three regions of Peru (coast, highlands, and jungle). The instrument was adapted based on an instrument previously validated related to the concern caused by COVID-19 in Peru. Content-based validity was calculated with Aiken's V coefficient, internal structure with confirmatory factor analysis, and reliability with the omega coefficient. The first evidence of validity of EP-VIR-MONK based on its content, internal structure, and reliability in a sample of Peruvian adults is presented here.

"Hospital resilience to extreme events: A staff capability of attendance perspective","The increasing frequency of natural hazards continues to stretch the operation of hospital services. Hospitals are expected to remain fully operational during and in the immediate aftermath of hazards to serve those who need healthcare. Despite the substantial research work on preparedness, hospitals still vulnerable and, in many cases, incapable of responding adequately due to issues such as damage to infrastructure and shortage of staff. Substantial research work was conducted on staff willingness to attend workplace;however, little work was able to ascertain the actual capability of staff to attend. This study aims to evaluate the capability of hospital staff to attend their workplace regardless of their backgrounds, jobs, and levels, making it a more accurate representation of the natural operation of hospitals. It contributes to the healthcare resilience body of knowledge, specifically related to hospital staff attendance during and post-disaster events. Data was collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 1841 hospital staff members from different departments. Results show that the decision to attend the duty during or post-disaster event involves many complex personal and professional factors that can change, depending on the type of disaster, working environment preparedness and the personal responsibilities of the staff. Dependency, travel, training, and mental health in addition to age and work experience influence the capability to staff attend hospital post disasters. Findings established each of hospital's departments, services and professions play a key role in the provision of healthcare service no matter their backgrounds, role, and hierarchical levels.","Achour, Nebil, Elhaj, Hamza, Ali, Afsar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102851","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction;: 102851, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40190,""
"The comedia unbound","While the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was disastrous for theater companies everywhere, the comedia was arguably energized by its constraints. The En compaÃ±Ã­a de los clÃ¡sicos initiative in Spain, the theatrical presentations at the Association for Hispanic Classical Theater (AHCT) virtual conference in July 2020, and the reimagined virtual LA Escena Festival of Hispanic Classical Theater suggest that 2020 may have been a banner year for comedia. The engagement with the classics by cutting-edge companies producing durational, site-specific, participatory, and immersive theater revealed novel artistic possibilities and engaged new audiences, radically transforming the sense of what is possible when staging the corpus. At the same time, and even as individual companies grappled with the impact of the pandemic, the larger institutional landscape of theater in Spain continued to promote a transatlantic narrative of comedia that argues for its relevance beyond Spain itself. The comedia thus appears doubly unbound: newly freed from formal constraints, and promoted in and to a broader geography.","Fuchs, Barbara","https://doi.org/10.1080/08831157.2022.2028271","","Database: Taylor & Francis; Publication type: article; Publication details: Romance Quarterly;: 1-9, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40191,""
"Risk factors for workplace bullying, severe psychological distress and suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic among the general working population in Japan: a large-scale cross-sectional study","To investigate the risk factors for workplace bullying and mental health outcomes among workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study. A nationwide online survey was conducted from August to September 2020 in Japan. 16Ã¢â‚¬â€°384 workers (men: n=9565; women: n=6789). Workplace bullying was measured by one item from the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire; severe psychological distress according to the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (Ã¢â€°Â¥13) and suicidal ideation by one item. Prevalence ratios were calculated by modified Poisson regression analyses adjusting for potential confounders such as gender, age, occupational characteristics and a prior history of depression. Overall, 15% of workers experienced workplace bullying, 9% had severe psychological distress and 12% had suicidal ideation during the second and third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. The results of this study showed men, executives, managers and permanent employees had a higher risk of bullying than women or part-time workers. Increased physical and psychological demands were common risk factors for bullying, severe psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Starting to work from home was a significant predictor for adverse mental health outcomes but a preventive factor against workplace bullying. The results of this study showed different high-risk groups for bullying or mental health during the pandemic. Any intervention to decrease workplace bullying or mental health problems should focus not only on previously reported vulnerable workers but also workers who have experienced a change in work style or job demands.","Tsuno, Tabuchi","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059860","20221102","COVID-19; Epidemiology; MENTAL HEALTH; OCCUPATIONAL &amp; INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40192,""
"Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam COVID-19 exposure index: a cross-sectional analysis of the impact of the pandemic on daily functioning of older adults","The aim of this study was to develop an index to measure older adults' exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic and to study its association with various domains of functioning. Cross-sectional study. The Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), a cohort study in the Netherlands. Community-dwelling older adults aged 62-102 years (n=1089) who participated in the LASA COVID-19 study (June-September 2020), just after the first wave of the pandemic. A 35-item COVID-19 exposure index with a score ranging between 0 and 1 was developed, including items that assess the extent to which the COVID-19 situation affected daily lives of older adults. Descriptive characteristics of the index were studied, stratified by several sociodemographic factors. Logistic regression analyses were performed to study associations between the exposure index and several indicators of functioning (functional limitations, anxiety, depression and loneliness). The mean COVID-19 exposure index score was 0.20 (SD 0.10). Scores were relatively high among women and in the southern region of the Netherlands. In models adjusted for sociodemographic factors and prepandemic functioning (2018-2019), those with scores in the highest tertile of the exposure index were more likely to report functional limitations (OR: 2.24; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.48 to 3.38), anxiety symptoms (OR: 3.14; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.82 to 5.44), depressive symptoms (OR: 2.49; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 1.55 to 4.00) and loneliness (OR: 2.97; 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI: 2.08 to 4.26) than those in the lowest tertile. Among older adults in the Netherlands, higher exposure to the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with worse functioning in the physical, mental and social domain. The newly developed exposure index may be used to identify persons for whom targeted interventions are needed to maintain or improve functioning during the pandemic or postpandemic.","Hoogendijk, Schuster, van Tilburg, Schaap, Suanet, De Breij, Kok, Van Schoor, Timmermans, de Jongh, Visser, Huisman","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061745","20221102","COVID-19; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PUBLIC HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40193,""
"Life after COVID-19: the road from intensive care back to living - a prospective cohort study","The aim of the study was to evaluate recovery of participation in post-COVID-19 patients during the first year after intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. The secondary aim was to identify the early determinants associated with recovery of participation. Prospective cohort study. COVID-19 post-ICU inpatient rehabilitation in the Netherlands, during the first epidemic wave between April and July 2020, with 1-year follow-up. COVID-19 ICU survivors Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years of age needing inpatient rehabilitation. Participation in society was assessed by the 'Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation-Participation' (USER-P) restrictions scale. Secondary measures of body function impairments (muscle force, pulmonary function, fatigue (Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory), breathlessness (Medical Research Council (MRC) breathlessness scale), pain (Numerical Rating Scale)), activity limitations (6-minute walking test, Patient reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) 8b), personal factors (coping (Utrecht Proactive Coping Scale), anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), post-traumatic stress (Global Psychotrauma Screen-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), cognitive functioning (Checklist for Cognitive Consequences after an ICU-admission)) and social factors were used. linear mixed-effects model, with recovery of participation levels as dependent variable. Patient characteristics in domains of body function, activity limitations, personal and social factors were added as independent variables. This study included 67 COVID-19 ICU survivors (mean age 62 years, 78% male). Mean USER-P restrictions scores increased over time; mean participation levels increasing from 62.0, 76.5 to 86.1 at 1, 3 and 12 months, respectively. After 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year, 50% had not fully resumed work and restrictions were reported in physical exercise (51%), household duties (46%) and leisure activities (29%). Self-reported complaints of breathlessness and fatigue, more perceived limitations in daily life, as well as personal factors (less proactive coping style and anxiety/depression complaints) were associated with delayed recovery of participation (all p value &lt;0.05). This study supports the view that an integral vision of health is important when looking at the long-term consequence of post-ICU COVID-19. Personal factors such as having a less proactive coping style or mental impairments early on contribute to delayed recovery.","Wiertz, Hemmen, Sep, van Santen, van Horn, van Kuijk, Verbunt","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2022-062332","20221102","Adult intensive &amp; critical care; COVID-19; REHABILITATION MEDICINE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40194,""
"Prevalence, risk factors and treatments for post-COVID-19 breathlessness: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Persistent breathlessness &gt;28 days after acute COVID-19 infection has been identified as a highly debilitating post-COVID symptom. However, the prevalence, risk factors, mechanisms and treatments for post-COVID breathlessness remain poorly understood. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase for relevant studies published from 1 January 2020 to 1 November 2021 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021285733) and included 119 eligible papers. Random-effects meta-analysis of 42Ã¢â‚¬â€¦872 patients with COVID-19 reported in 102 papers found an overall prevalence of post-COVID breathlessness of 26% (95% CI 23-29) when measuring the presence/absence of the symptom, and 41% (95% CI 34-48) when using Medical Research Council (MRC)/modified MRC dyspnoea scale. The pooled prevalence decreased significantly from 1-6Ã¢â‚¬â€¦months to 7-12 months post-infection. Post-COVID breathlessness was more common in those with severe/critical acute infection, those who were hospitalised and females, and was less likely to be reported by patients in Asia than those in Europe or North America. Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed (including deconditioning, restrictive/obstructive airflow limitation, systemic inflammation, impaired mental health), but the body of evidence remains inconclusive. Seven cohort studies and one randomised controlled trial suggested rehabilitation exercises may reduce post-COVID breathlessness. There is an urgent need for mechanistic research and development of interventions for the prevention and treatment of post-COVID breathlessness.","Zheng, Daines, Han, Hurst, Pfeffer, Shankar-Hari, Elneima, Walker, Brown, Siddiqui, Quint, Brightling, Evans, Wain, Heaney, Sheikh","https://doi.org/10.1183/16000617.0071-2022","20221102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40195,""
"Age and sex differences in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health and coping mechanisms in Latin American youth","The COVID-19 pandemic has had negative effects on mental health. Understanding sex and age differences in the perception of stressors, the use of coping strategies, and the prevalence of depression and anxiety can lead to detecting at-risk groups. A cross-sectional online study surveyed perceived stressors, coping strategies, and the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 rating scales for symptoms of depression and anxiety. The study was open from Spring 2020 to Spring 2021 and was aimed at children, adolescents and young adults of Latin America. The survey was completed by 3965 participants (63.8% females). The sample was divided into children (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 621, 15.7%), adolescents (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 1123, 28.3%) and young adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2021, 56%). Moderate to severe symptoms of depression and anxiety were found in 43.53% and 27%, respectively, being more frequent in females. Children of both sexes showed the lowest scores in rating scales. Adult females reported a higher level of stress in regards to pandemic news, having someone close diagnosed with COVID-19,the possibility of getting sick, academic delays, economic impact, and depression, while female adolescents reported a higher level of stress regarding the lockdown, losing contact with peers and anxiety. In juxtaposition, females also reported a higher frequency of positive coping strategies. A multivariate analysis confirmed the association of several variables with the presence of depression and anxiety. A high prevalence of depression and anxiety was found among young people. Specific intervention programs must be created taking into account age and sex differences.","Ulloa, Apiquian, de la PeÃƒÂ±a, DÃƒÂ­az, Mayer, Palacio, Palacios-Cruz, HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, GarcÃƒÂ­a, Rosetti","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.10.005","20221102","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Latin America; Pediatric","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40196,""
"Provider Perspectives on Telemental Health Usage After COVID-19: A Retrospective Analysis","Mental health care pivoted to telemedicine during COVID-19, and there is uncertainty around the sustainability of this rapid shift. This study examined how intentions to continue using telemedicine post-COVID are influenced by provider perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, professional social influence, facilitating organizational conditions. We conducted a web-based, cross-sectional survey of 369 telemental health providers between February and March 2021. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to predict intentions to continue using telemedicine post-COVID. Most providers began using telemedicine March 2020 or later (257/369, 69.6%) and saw Ã¢â€°Â¥50% of their clients via telemedicine (299/369, 81.0%). Analyses revealed that intention to continue using telemedicine post-COVID was predicted by telemedicine caseload (Ã¯ÂÂ¢ = .10; P = .005), perceived usefulness in general (Ã¯ÂÂ¢ = .10; P = .008), ease-of-use (Ã¯ÂÂ¢ = .08; P = .04), social influence (Ã¯ÂÂ¢ = .68; P &lt; .001) and facilitating conditions (Ã¯ÂÂ¢ = .08; P = .047). Exploration into predictors of telemedicine usage beyond COVID-19 aids in surveillance of telemedicine usage, integration with future clinic workflows, and the shaping of public policy. It is important to consider telemedicine services not only as a response to a crisis, but as an effective and useful solution for everyday life.

Nevertheless, the presence of green and blue spaces has been shown to be able to encourage physical activities and alleviate the mental distress caused by COVID-19. However, just as the impact of COVID-19 varies by geographical region and area, the distribution of green and blue spaces is also different across different neighborhoods and areas. By using Hong Kong as the study area, we determine the local neighborhoods that suffer from both high COVID-19 infection risk as well as low green and blue space accessibility.

"Brief App-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Anxiety Symptoms in Psychiatric Inpatients: Feasibility Randomized Controlled Trial","Psychiatric inpatients often have limited access to psychotherapeutic education or skills for managing anxiety, a common transdiagnostic concern in severe and acute mental illness. COVID-19-related restrictions further limited access to therapy groups on inpatient psychiatric units. App-based interventions may improve access, but evidence supporting the feasibility of their use, acceptability, and effectiveness in psychiatric inpatient settings is limited. MindShift CBT is a free app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles with evidence for alleviating anxiety symptoms in the outpatient setting. We aimed to recruit 24 participants from an acute general psychiatric inpatient ward to a 1-month randomized control study assessing the feasibility and acceptability of providing patients with severe and acute mental illness access to the MindShift CBT app for help with managing anxiety symptoms. Recruitment, data collection, analysis, and interpretation were completed collaboratively by clinician and peer researchers. Inpatients were randomized to two conditions: treatment as usual (TAU) versus TAU plus use of the MindShift CBT app over 6 days. We collected demographic and quantitative data on acceptability and usability of the intervention. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress were measured in pre- and poststudy surveys for preliminary signals of efficacy. We conducted individual semistructured interviews with participants in the MindShift CBT app group at the end of their trial period, which were interpreted using a standardized protocol for thematic analysis. Over 4 weeks, 33 inpatients were referred to the study, 24 consented to participate, 20 were randomized, and 11 completed the study. Of the 9 randomized participants who did not complete the study, 7 were withdrawn because they were discharged or transferred prior to study completion, with a similar distribution among both conditions. Among the enrolled patients, 65% (13/20) were admitted for a psychotic disorder and no patient was admitted primarily for an anxiety disorder. The average length of stay was 20 days (SD 4.4; range 3-21) and 35% (7/20) of patients were involuntarily admitted to hospital. Small sample sizes limited accurate interpretation of the efficacy data. Themes emerging from qualitative interviews included acceptability and usability of the app, and patient agency associated with voluntary participation in research while admitted to hospital. Our study benefitted from collaboration between peer and clinician researchers. Due to rapid patient turnover in the acute inpatient setting, additional flexibility in recruitment and enrollment is needed to determine the efficacy of using app-based psychotherapy on an acute psychiatric ward. Despite the limited sample size, our study suggests that similar interventions may be feasible and acceptable for acutely unwell inpatients. Further study is needed to compare the efficacy of psychotherapeutic apps with existing standards of care in this setting.

"Association of Promoting Housing Affordability and Stability With Improved Health Outcomes: A Systematic Review","Housing insecurity-that is, difficulty with housing affordability and stability-is prevalent and results in increased risk for both homelessness and poor health. However, whether interventions that prevent housing insecurity upstream of homelessness improve health remains uncertain. To review evidence characterizing associations of primary prevention strategies for housing insecurity with adult physical health, mental health, health-related behaviors, health care use, and health care access. Pairs of independent reviewers systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, EconLit, and the Social Interventions Research and Evaluation Network for quantitative studies published from 2005 to 2021 that evaluated interventions intended to directly improve housing affordability and/or stability either by supporting at-risk households (targeted primary prevention) or by enhancing community-level housing supply and affordability in partnership with the health sector (structural primary prevention). Risk of bias was appraised using validated tools, and the evidence was synthesized using modified Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria. A total of 26 articles describing 3 randomized trials and 20 observational studies (16 longitudinal designs and 4 cross-sectional quasi-waiting list control designs) were included. Existing interventions have focused primarily on mitigating housing insecurity for the most vulnerable individuals rather than preventing housing insecurity outright. Moderate-certainty evidence was found that eviction moratoriums were associated with reduced COVID-19 cases and deaths. Certainty of evidence was low or very low for health associations of other targeted primary prevention interventions, including emergency rent assistance, legal assistance with waiting list priority for public housing, long-term rent subsidies, and homeownership assistance. No studies evaluated health system-partnered structural primary prevention strategies. This systematic review found mixed and mostly low-certainty evidence that interventions that promote housing affordability and stability were associated with improved adult health outcomes. Existing interventions may need to be paired with other efforts to address the structural determinants of health. As health care systems and insurers respond to increasing opportunities to invest in housing as a determinant of health, further research is needed to clarify where along the housing insecurity pathway interventions should focus for the most effective and equitable health impact.","Chen, Miake-Lye, Begashaw, Zimmerman, Larkin, McGrath, Shekelle","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.39860","20221102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40202,""
"[State of mind in adolescents in Barcelona province (Spain): Evolution, associated factors and impact of the pandemic]","To analyse the evolution of state of mind in adolescents in the province of Barcelona for the last six years and the specific impact of the pandemic and its experience.

Since 2015/2016 a Questionnaire on health related habits was carried out among 4<sup>th</sup> year high school students to which a COVID-19 chapter was added in the 2020/2021 academic year. There was a representative provincial pre-pandemic sample (N=15,118) and a sample during the pandemic (N=4,966). The dichotomous aggregate variable of positive/negative state of mind was constructed with six specific items to which the bivariate analyses and a multivariate generalized mixed linear model were carried out for both periods. Analysis performed with SAS. The pandemic significantly intensified the trend of worsening the state of mind adolescents, and widened the gender gap. Boys went from 17.9% (pre-pandemic) to 25.7% (during pandemic) with a negative mood, while girls from 31.9% to 52.9%. In modelling during pandemic, socioeconomic and family factors appeared relevant and significant. Sex, perceived poor health, being victim of harassment, self-perception of weight, excessive use of the internet and a poor perception of the residential environment remained significant as in the pre-pandemic model. The specific negative impact of the pandemic on adolescents' mental well-being is perceived, but it is too early to tell whether it is reversible or not and to assess the effectiveness of interventions to tackle it.

"An Intelligent Algorithm to Predict GDP Rate and Find a Relationship Between COVID-19 Outbreak and Economic Downturn","With the spread of COVID-19, economic damages are challenging for governments and people's livelihood besides its dangerous and negative impact on humanity's health, which can be led to death. Various health guidelines have been proposed to tackle the virus outbreak including quarantine, restriction rules to imports, exports, migrations, and tourist arrival that were affected by economic depression. Providing an approach to predict the economic situation has a highlighted role in managing crisis when a country faces a problem such as a disease epidemic. We propose an intelligent algorithm to predict the economic situation that utilizes neural networks (NNs) to satisfy the aim. Our work estimates correlation coefficient based on the spearman method between gross domestic product rate (GDPR) and other economic statistics to find effective parameters on growing up and falling GDPR and also determined the NNs' inputs. We study the reported economic and disease statistics in Germany, India, Australia, and Thailand countries to evaluate the algorithm's efficiency in predicting economic situation. The experimental results demonstrate the prediction accuracy of approximately 96% and 89% for one and more months ahead, respectively. Our method can help governments to present efficient policies for preventing economic damages.","Rahmani, Hosseini Mirmahaleh","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10614-022-10332-9","20221102","COVID-19; Economic damage; Intelligent algorithm; Neural network; Prediction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40205,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on the Behaviors and Attitudes of Children and Adolescents: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background and objective Over the past few decades, new infectious diseases have emerged,Ã‚Â and these have played a key role in changing behavior and lifestyle in all age groups. More recently, with the emergence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, governments around the world have made unprecedented efforts to contain the epidemic by implementing quarantine measures, social distancing, and isolating infected individuals. Social behavioral adaptations (e.g., social distancing, isolation, etc.) impact children's and adolescents' lifestyle activities and lead to increased incidence of psychosocial problems, worsening of preexisting mental illness, and fears of infection, uncertainty, isolation, and stress. In light of this, this study aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the behaviors and lifestyles of the children and adolescent population of Pakistan. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 323 children and adolescents byÃ‚Â targeting parents of children and adolescents in the age group of 4-18 yearsÃ‚Â living in Pakistan.Ã‚Â The study was conducted from April 2021 to September 2021. A well-designed structured questionnaire was used to collect data about the sociodemographic profile, attitudes, and behavioral factors impacted by COVID-19 in children and adolescents. SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM, Armonk, NY)Ã‚Â was used to enter and analyze data. Results Parents or caregivers of a total of 189 male and 134 female childrenÃ‚Â aged between four and 18 years took part in this study.Ã‚Â During COVID-19, the consumption of fast food and fried foods by children and adolescentsÃ‚Â increased significantly.Ã‚Â In this study, out of 323 participants, almost all (289, 89.5%) had increased their screen time significantly.Ã‚Â Nearly half of the total individuals experienced the feeling of depression and loneliness during the pandemic. Additionally, some children and adolescents felt fearful when leaving home. COVID-19 lockdowns have led to many changes in children's and adolescents' lifestyle habits. They reduced physical contact with others due to the fear of transmission of COVID-19. Based on our findings, the pandemic and its containment strategies have adversely affected the behaviors, lifestyles, and attitudes of children and adolescents. Conclusion Governments around the world have imposed social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to adverse short-term and long-term negative mental health issues such as unhappiness, fear, worry, irritability, depressive symptoms, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Interventions are needed to focus on building resilience in children and adolescents, addressing their fears and concerns through better communication, encouraging routine and physical activity, and taking measures to alleviate loneliness.","Annam, Fleming, Gulraiz, Zafar, Khan, Oghomitse-Omene, Saleemuddin, Patel, Ahsan, Qavi","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29719","20221102","adolescent; child and adolescent psychiatry; child attitudes; child behaviour; covid-19; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40206,""
"Long-Term Neurological Sequelae Among Severe COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Few studies have thoroughly evaluated the neuro-invasive effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)Ã‚Â infection, which may contribute to a wide range of sequelae from mild long-term effects like headaches and fatigue to severe events like stroke and arrhythmias. Our study aimed to evaluate the long-term neurological effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) amongÃ‚Â patients discharged from the hospital. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the long-term neurocognitive effects of COVID-19. Post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae were defined as persistent symptoms of headache, fatigue, myalgia, anosmia, dysgeusia, sleep disturbance, issues with concentration, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), suicidality, and depression long after the acute phase of COVID-19. Data from observational studies describing post-COVID-19 neurocognitive sequelae and severity of COVID-19 from September 1, 2019, to the present were extracted following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol with a consensus of three independent reviewers. A systematic review was performed for qualitative evaluation and a meta-analysis was performed for quantitative analysis by calculating log odds of COVID-19 neurocognitive sequelae. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were obtained and forest plots were created using random effects models.Ã‚ We found seven studies, out of which three were used for quantitative synthesis of evidence. Of the 3,304 post-COVID-19 patients identified, 50.27% were male with a mean age of 56 years; 20.20%Ã‚Â had post-COVID-19 symptoms more than two weeks after the acute phase of infection. AmongÃ‚Â persistence symptoms, neurocognitive symptoms like headache (27.8%), fatigue (26.7%), myalgia (23.14%), anosmia (22.8%), dysgeusia (12.1%), sleep disturbance (63.1%), confusion (32.6%), difficulty to concentrate (22%), and psychiatric symptoms like PTSD (31%), feeling depressed (20%), and suicidality (2%) had a higher prevalence. In meta-analysis, COVID-19 patients with severe symptoms had higher odds of headache (pooled OR: 4.53; 95% CI: 2.37-8.65;Ã‚Â p&lt;0.00001; I<sup>2</sup>: 0%) and myalgia (pooled OR: 3.36; 95% CI: 2.71-4.17;Ã‚Â p&lt;0.00001; I<sup>2</sup>: 0%). Anosmia, fatigue, and dysgeusia had higher but non-significant odds following COVID-19. Although we had sufficient data for headache and fatigue to identify higher rates and associations following COVID-19, we could not establish relationships with other post-COVID-19 neurocognitive sÃƒÂ©queles. Long-term follow-up may mitigate the neurocognitive effects amongÃ‚Â COVID-19 patients as these symptoms are also associated with a poor quality of life.","Patel, Mehta, Patel, Patel, Ortiz, Khurana, Urhoghide, Parulekar, Bhriguvanshi, Patel, Mistry, Patel, Arumaithurai, Shah","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29694","20221102","covid-19; covid-19 neuropsychiatric manifestations; post acute sequelae of sars cov-2 infection (pasc); post covid-19 persistent headache and fatigue; sars-cov-2 and covid-19","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40207,""
"Alcohol Use Disorder Admissions During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From a Tertiary Community Hospital","The first case of Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) in the United States was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in January 2020. The presence of COVID-19 and the subsequent spread of this disease led to stress, anxiety, grief, and worry. We aimed to study the rate of hospital admission for alcohol use disorder (AUD) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in a tertiary community hospital in Michigan. Two subsets of hospital data were collected for comparison between hospitalized patients before and during the pandemic in a tertiary community hospital. Logistic regression was used to identify the odds ratio of AUD admission rates among all patients in 2020 compared with 2019 while controlling for covariates. Our data showed a statistically significant increase in AUD patients in 2020 compared to 2019 (3.26% versus 2.50%, adjusted OR=1.44 with P=0.002). In addition, females had significantly lower chances of admission for AUD compared with males (OR=0.22 with P&lt;0.001) and African Americans had significantly lower chances of admission for AUD compared to Whites (OR=0.44 with P &lt;0.001). Divorced patients had a higher probability of admission for AUD compared to married patients (OR=2.62 with P&lt;0.001). Our study found a significantly higher rate of AUD admissions in 2020 during the COVID-19 Pandemic compared to 2019. Gender, race, age, and marital status are significant risk factors related to AUD admissions.","Tikaria, Khan, Wang, Olomu, Rayamajhi, Basnet","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29711","20221102","alcohol use disorder; covid 19 pandemic; covid-19 retro; hospital admissions; mental health; substance abuse","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40208,""
"Lessons Learned During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Central India: Overlooked Psychological and Social Determinants of Health","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which started in 2019, has created unprecedented public health problems, mental health crises, and economic and social problems. These effects have been studied by numerous researchers on the general population but none on hospitalized and discharged COVID-19 patients. To assess psychological and social problems among hospitalized and discharged COVID-19 patients. During lockdown and post-lockdown in India, we interviewed 500 COVID-19 patients admitted at our tertiary care center during their hospitalization and post-discharge period for psychological and social problems. The common psychological issues in hospitalized patients during lockdown were anxiety and misconceptions about COVID-19, while insomnia, anxiety, and frustration were common during the post-lockdown period. The typical social problems in hospitalized patients during the lockdown were containment-related issues, discrimination, longer wait for repeat COVID-19 tests, and boredom; whereas issues related to employment and financial matters were common during post-lockdown. Psychological problems comparatively decreased whereas social problems increased after discharge. Unrehearsed mitigation strategies at the beginning of the pandemic unknowingly led to various psychological and social problems. It was further aggravated by a lack of information and miscommunication.","Kaithwas, Pawar, Yadav, Ingle, Sethia, Sethia","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29686","20221102","covid 19 impact of lockdown; covid-19 retro; pandemic prevention and control; psychological issues; public heath; social issues","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40209,""
"Eclampsia and Postpartum Depression in the Setting of Recurrent Prenatal COVID-19","Current research suggests COVID-19 in pregnancy is associated with poor maternal and fetal outcomes, although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, and the approach to the management of affected patients presents a distinct challenge to clinicians. We present a case of gestational hypertension, eclampsia, and postpartum depression in a 39-year-old gravida 4, para 0030 (G4P0) pregnant patient following multiple prenatal severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. After a case of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) during her first trimester, the patient received a two-dose mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Despite vaccination, she again contracted COVID-19 during her third trimester of pregnancy. She subsequently developed gestational hypertension at 38 weeks necessitating a cesarean section at 38+4 weeks. The patient delivered a healthy neonate, however, her postpartum course was complicated by eclampsia and postpartum depression. This case bolsters current literature and emphasizes the necessity of continued research into the effects of COVID-19 in pregnant and postpartum women.","Cook, Zargar, Torres","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.29654","20221102","covid-19; eclampsia; gestational hypertension; postpartum depression; pre-eclampsia; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40210,""
"COVID-19 in rural America: Time, space, and change","In recent decades, a culture of hopelessness has emerged among rural Americans, visible in epidemic levels of suicide, overdose, and other addiction-related illnesses. While the arrival of a novel coronavirus aggravated existing strains in rural economies, it also enabled positive transformations in some rural cities and towns. This research explores how businesses in rural America experienced and adapted to economic shocks caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and, in the process, changed the economic and social landscape. Applying a qualitative research methodology, the present research offers Pennsylvania's Central Susquehanna Valley as a case study, using data from 60 semi-structured interviews. The analyses demonstrate rural businesses' resiliency and adaptive responses, bolstered by embedded rural capitals and the unique characteristics of rural businesses themselves. Furthermore, the pandemic forced drastic changes for businesses in the rural landscape. On the one hand, Covid-19's losses and miseries take much material, human, and social resources from the rural community. On the other hand, changing relationships between businessowners and workers, and among partners in the supply chain could be long-lasting, creating extra rural capitals and better working relationships at the factory and beyond. Finally, adoption of new technologies and automation; new business directions, such as e-commerce and higher value-added production; and increases in mergers and acquisitions across industries were prevalent during 2020-2021. In many ways, the Covid-19 impacts could make rural America more dynamic and competitive. This research offers conceptual and empirical pathways to supporting economic and social development in rural America.","Ngo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2022.10.022","20221102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40211,""
"The Effect of Wearing a Mask on Facial Attractiveness","The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated masking in public spaces. Masks may impact the perceived attractiveness of individuals and hence, interpersonal relations. To determine if facial coverings affect attractiveness. An online survey was conducted using 114 headshot images, 2 each-unmasked and masked-of 57 individuals. Two hundred and seven participants rated them on an ordinal scale from 1 (least attractive) to 10 (most attractive). Parametric and nonparametric tests were performed, as appropriate, for comparison. For the first quartile, the average rating increased significantly when wearing a mask (5.89 Ã‚Â± 0.29 and 6.54 Ã‚Â± 0.67; <i>P</i> = 0.01). For control images ranked within the fourth quartile, the average rating decreased significantly when wearing a mask (7.60 Ã‚Â± 0.26 and 6.62 Ã‚Â± 0.55; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). In the female subgroup (n = 34), there was a small increase in average rating when masked, whereas in the male subgroup (n = 23), there was a small decrease in average rating when masked, but the change was not statistically significant (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05). For unmasked female images ranked within the first quartile, the average rating increased significantly when wearing a mask (5.77 Ã‚Â± 0.27 and 6.76 Ã‚Â± 0.36; <i>P</i> = 0.001). For the female subgroup with mean ratings within the fourth quartile, the average decreased significantly when wearing a medical mask (7.53 Ã‚Â± 0.30 and 6.77 Ã‚Â± 0.53; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). For unmasked male images ranked within the first quartile, the average rating increased when wearing a medical mask but the change was not statistically significant (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.05), whereas for the control male images within the fourth quartile, the average rating decreased significantly when masked (7.72 Ã‚Â± 0.18 and 6.50 Ã‚Â± 0.54; <i>P</i> &lt; 0.05). While wearing a facial covering significantly increased attractiveness for images less attractive at baseline, and decreased attractiveness for those that are more attractive at baseline; it did not cause a significant overall change in attractiveness in the study population.","Bassiri-Tehrani, Nguyen, Choudhary, Guart, Di Chiaro, Purnell","https://doi.org/10.1093/asjof/ojac070","20221102","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40212,""

Studies reporting on individuals receiving prophylactic or curative drugs for COVID-19 with at least one CNS adverse event were included. Articles reporting on CNS adverse events associated with medication for other health conditions were excluded. The search retrieved 1 547 articles, eight of which met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies had an observational design. A total of 3 035 individuals were assessed, of whom 1 701 were health care professionals and 1 978 were women. Curative treatment with hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and azithromycin was the most frequent (n = 5). The most common adverse events were headache, dizziness, mood disturbances, and drowsiness. Suicide was the most frequent severe event. Six adverse events were unexpected for hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, and doxycycline. Potential CNS adverse events were unspecific and in general potentially associated with the use of hydroxychloroquine (monotherapy or associated with antibiotics).

"Individuals with hearing impairment/deafness during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid review on communication challenges and strategies","This study aimed (a) to identify the communication issues and problems faced by individuals with hearing impairment (HI)/deafness during the COVID-19 pandemic and (b) to describe strategies to overcome the issues/problems and/or prevent their negative impact. Individuals with mild or severe HI face everyday communication problems, which have been worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, no studies have summarised the available evidence to better understand the communication challenges faced by them and strategies allowing better interactions. The long duration of the outbreak-more than 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, with policies that have just been lifted in some countries-and the possible return of restrictions in the next Winter suggest the need to summarise evidence in the field. A rapid review is reported here in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Medline, CINAHL and Scopus databases were searched, including (a) primary or secondary studies published from January 2020 to 12 January 2022, (b) involving individuals with HI/deafness, (c) during the COVID-19 pandemic and (d) written in English. Data were extracted and summarised by using a content analysis approach. No Patient or Public Contribution. Fourteen studies were included as follows: three non-systematic reviews, seven cross-sectional, three quasi- experimental and one qualitative study, performed mainly in the US and the UK. Face mask covering use; physical and social distancing; and information, education, rehabilitation, and healthcare accessibility have emerged as the main challenges triggering consequences such as social isolation, loneliness, poor knowledge regarding the prevention and mental health issues. Strategies mitigating these challenges are as follows: (a) adopting transparent face masks, (b) using basic skills while interacting (e.g. maintaining eye contact), (c) improving the availability of sign language interpreters, (d) allowing the presence of family members and (e) teaching basics of sign language to healthcare professionals. Individuals with HI/deafness live with several challenges, suggesting that their vulnerability has increased tremendously during the COVID-19 pandemic. The effectiveness of strategies to overcome these difficulties should be scrutinised by conducting more research. Moreover, there should be increased awareness among all citizens by equipping them with simple strategies to communicate effectively with individuals with HI, an approach that may increase inclusiveness and prevent further negative consequences and burden.","Mansutti, Achil, Rosa Gastaldo, TomÃƒÂ© Pires, Palese","https://doi.org/10.1111/jocn.16572","20221102","COVID-19; barriers; communication difficulties; deafness; hearing impairment; limitations; sign language; strategies","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40214,""

A significant number of COVID-19 specific conspiracy theories emerged in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic outbreak. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 during the first year of the pandemic (2020), to identify their prevalence, their determinants and their public health consequences. A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed and PsycINFO to detect all studies examining any conspiracy theory related to COVID-19 between January 1st 2020, and January 10th 2021. Forty-three studies were included with a total of 61,809 participants. Between 0.4 and 82.7% of participants agreed with at least one conspiracy belief. Certain sociodemographic factors (young age, female gender, being non-white, lower socioeconomic status), psychological aspects (pessimism, blaming others, anger) and other qualities (political conservatism, religiosity, mistrust in science and using social media as source of information) were associated with increased acceptance of conspiracy theories.

"The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression among physical therapists in Saudi Arabia: a cross-sectional study","A physical therapist may become infected while treating a patient since they are in direct contact with them or within a two-meter radius. In addition, physical therapists may feel that they are more susceptible to COVID-19 infection when applying rehabilitation practices, which often involve direct contact with patients. The physical therapist were surveyed on their level of anxiety and depression due to the Coronavirus disease pandemic (COVID-19). The physical therapists were asked to complete two reliable and validated scales, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), to identify the presence of anxiety and depression in the participants. In addition, logistic regression models were used to determine the general characteristics of anxiety or depression. Among the 117 physical therapists who completed and participated in the study, 74 (63%) and 65 (55.5%) physical therapists reported having symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. The prevalence of overall anxiety levels was higher; mild (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.09;Ã‚Â PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.08), moderate (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.26;Ã‚Â PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.15), and severe levels six times as high (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.28;Ã‚Â PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.1) in females compared to male physical therapists. Females, younger age, unmarried individuals, not having children, and not living with family showed a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression. Binary logistic regression analysis also revealed that the female gender, a single individual, and having no children were associated with anxiety and depression. A significant percentage of physical therapists reported symptoms of anxiety and depression, especially among females, younger age, single individuals, not having children, and not living with family. Thus, the mental health of physical therapists is suggested to be constantly and cautiously monitored, especially for those at high risk of developing psychological symptoms.","Abdulghani, Ahmad, Abdulghani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-022-03785-x","20221103","Anxiety; COVID19; Depression; Mental health; Physical therapists; Humans; Male; Female; COVID-19; Pandemics; Physical Therapists; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; SARS-CoV-2; Saudi Arabia; Anxiety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40216,""
"The Impact of COVID-19 on Clubhouse Employment Programs","The Clubhouse model of psychosocial rehabilitation provides several employment opportunities to individuals who experience mental health concerns, including transitional, supported, and independent employment. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in Clubhouses having to adapt existing programs to online formats. Employment programs were further impacted, as many workplaces in the community closed or reduced capacity. The present study aimed to examine the rates of involvement in transitional, supported, and independent employment across six Clubhouses in Canada throughout the pandemic. 462 members completed surveys at five time points pertaining to participation in Clubhouse employment programs. The data was analyzed using Cochran's Q tests to determine differences in employment rates across time points. The results demonstrated an overall decrease in transitional and supported employment rates throughout the pandemic. Conversely, rates of independent employment were unchanged. It is evident that Clubhouse employment programs assist members in obtaining employment.Ã‚Â The results suggest Clubhouses may benefit from exploring novel employment opportunities to support their members, such as remote work.","Junaid, Mutschler, McShane","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10597-022-01036-3","20221102","COVID-19; Clubhouse model; Employment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40217,""
"Excess suicide attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and social disparities in South Korea","The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on suicide remains unclear and might differ according to individuals' socioeconomic characteristics. We aimed to investigate excess suicide attributable to COVID-19 in South Korea, stratified by the outbreak period and individual characteristics. We obtained daily time-series suicide mortality data for January 2017-December 2020 from the Korea National Statistics Office and performed a two-stage interrupted time-series analysis. We estimated excess suicide in 16 regions of Korea using a quasi-Poisson time-series regression model and pooled the region-specific estimates using a mixed-effects multivariate meta-analysis model in the first and second stages, respectively. From February 18 to December 31, 2020, suicide decreased by 9.5% [95% empirical confidence interval (eCI): 3.8%, 15.6%] compared to the number expected from the pre-pandemic period. The decrease in excess suicide risk from the initial pandemic was pronounced during the pandemic's first and third waves. Further, we found that the decrease in suicide was more evident in individuals who were male [11.7% (95% eCI: 5.5%, 18.0%)], middle-aged [13.7% (95% eCI: 7.8%, 19.6%)], highly educated [12.6% (95% eCI: 6.4%, 19.4%)], and married [13.6% (95% eCI: 8.0%, 20.3%)] than in the general population, based on the point estimates. Our results provide timely evidence to establish public health policies for suicide prevention and suggest the prioritization of resource allocation for mental health of individuals based on individual characteristics.","Min, Oh, Kim, Kang, Ha, Kim, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22751-7","20221103","Middle Aged; Humans; Male; Female; COVID-19; Pandemics; Suicide; Republic of Korea; Time Factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40218,""
"Problematic Internet Use, Anxiety, Depression, and Stress Symptoms in Adults with COVID-19 Pandemic and Earthquake Experience: Insights from Croatian Online Survey","In 2020, Croatia was hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and two earthquakes. As previous research showed that Internet use (IU) increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, we carried out an online survey to determine the levels of problematic Internet use (PIU) and problematic specific Internet activities before and during the prolonged stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as earthquakes. We also determined the correlation between the PIU and specific Internet activities and anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. According to the responses of 1,118 participants from all Croatian regions, PIU increased by 14.1 percent (odds ratio [OR] 6.2), problematic social media use by 12.6 percent (OR 4.8), and uncontrolled online shopping by 5.3 percent (OR 5.8) in comparison with presurvey period. The PIU increase was significantly higher in participants reporting only pandemic-related stress than in those reporting both pandemic- and earthquake-related stress. Problematic social media use increased in those reporting only pandemic-related stress and both pandemic- and earthquake-related stress. The strongest correlation between PIU and problematic social media use and anxiety, depression, intrusion, and avoidance symptoms was found among those reporting both pandemic- and earthquake-related stress. The correlation between psychiatric measures and PIU and problematic specific Internet activities varied depending on the source of experienced or perceived stress. Our findings show the relationship between the problematic stress-related Internet behaviors, different types of stressors, and their impact on the overall PIU and problematic specific Internet activities in situations of prolonged stress.","KovaÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡ PetroviÃ„â€¡, Peraica, BlaÃ…Â¾ev, TomaÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡, KozariÃ„â€¡-KovaÃ„ÂiÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2022.0039","20221101","COVID-19; Internet use; anxiety; depression; earthquakes; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40219,""
"An Analysis of the Social Context of Video Games, Pathological Gaming, and Depressive Symptoms","This study addresses the relationship between the social context in which individuals play video games, pathological gaming, and depressive symptoms. A sample of 265 participants recruited through local gaming communities completed an online survey asking questions pertaining to demographics, the most common social context of their gaming, depressive symptoms, and pathological gaming. Participants also responded to the open-ended question ""How do you feel gaming has impacted you socially? Why?"" Many participants felt gaming helped to expand their social circle, maintain existing relationships, develop social skills, and connect with others during Covid-19 lockdowns. A small minority of participants reported that gaming displaced time they could have spent with friends and family, and sometimes damaged their social skills. Using an Ordinary Least Squares regression framework, quantitative results indicate that those who gamed primarily in-person with friends displayed lower levels of pathological gaming than all other contexts. Those who gamed in-person with friends also displayed lower levels of depressive symptoms, although this was found to be somewhat a function of time spent gaming. These results indicate that perhaps in-person gaming with friends is a protective context for gaming compared with online gaming, or solitary gaming.","Shawcroft, Coyne, Bradshaw","https://doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2022.0057","20221101","depression; mental health; pathological gaming; social gaming; video games","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40220,""
"Adolescent mental health during covid-19 pandemics: a systematic review","The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had wide-ranging outcomes on adolescents' well-being. However, less attention has been paid to the adolescent's mental health during the pandemic. The pandemic may impair adolescents' mental health through stress spillover from other family members, contextual and policy changes, and the disruption of everyday life routines. Therefore, our research is motivated by a need to address the relative scarcity of research examining adolescent mental health during the pandemic. This systematic review was conducted through the medical database, Web of Science, Scopus, Medline, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases for peer-reviewed, cross-sectional, cohort studies assessing the mental health status of adolescents during the Covid-19 virus pandemic from May 2020 till Dec 2022 without language restriction. Keywords were selected based on the Mesh terms and Emtree. Studies on coronavirus have revealed many significant psychological effects on teens of all ages. The most commom problems were on the stress and anxiety, sleep disorders, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder. Risk factors were concidered as prior mental health problem, female sexuality, fear of covid-19, nutrition, physical activity and listening the covid 19 news. Considering the critical age of teenagers, the role of parents is vital. Health policy maker should support parents as a key factors to approprate care for adolescent.

"Developing a mHealth intervention to reduce COVID-19 associated psychological distress among healthcare workers in Nigeria: Protocol for a Design and Feasibility Study","Globally, COVID-19 related psychological distress (CRPD) is seriously eroding healthcare workers' (HCWs) mental health and wellbeing especially in developing countries like Nigeria. Mobile health interventions (mHealth) are now increasingly recognized as an innovative approach that may improve mental health and wellbeing. This project aims to develop a mHealth psychological intervention (mPsyl) to reduce CRPD among HCWs in Nigeria. To present a study protocol to - determine the level of CRPD among HCW in Nigeria; explore HCWs experience of CRPD; develop and pilot-test a mPsyI to reduce CRPD and assess its feasibility (such as usability, engagement, and satisfaction). A mixed (quantitative and qualitative) methods in which HCWs will be recruited from two tertiary healthcare facilities in southwestern Nigeria. The study is divided into four phases based on the study objectives. Phase 1 involves a quantitative survey to assess the type and levels of psychosocial distress. Phase 2 collect qualitative data on psychosocial distress among HCWs. Phase 3 involves development of the mHealth-based psychological intervention while phase 4 is a mixed-methods study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. This study was funded in November 2020 by the Global Effort on COVID-19 (GECO) Health Research and collection of preliminary baseline data started in July 2021. This is the first study to report the development of a mHealth-based CRPD-reducing intervention among HCWs in Nigeria. Using a mixed methods design in this study can potentially facilitate the adaptation of an evidence-based treatment method that is culturally sensitive and cost-effective for management CRPD among HCWS in Nigeria. <AbstractText Label=""INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPORT"" NlmCategory=""UNASSIGNED"">DERR1-10.2196/36174.","Akinsulore, Aloba, Oginni, Oloniniyi, Ibigbami, Seun-Fadipe, Opakunle, Owojuyigbe, Olibamoyo, Mapayi, Okorie, Adewuya","https://doi.org/10.2196/36174","20221101","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40222,""
"Rare Case of Persistently Depressed T Lymphocyte Subsets After SARS-CoV-2 Infection","BACKGROUND On rare occasions, viral infections are known to also depress immune cell lines, further worsening clinical outcomes. We describe a patient who presented 3 weeks after recovery from mild COVID-19 disease with clinical features of an atypical pneumonia and was found to have a low CD4+ T-cell count. CASE REPORT An 82-year-old man with a past medical history of coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation presented with a 1-week history of progressively worsening shortness of breath and cough. He was noted to have recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 3 weeks prior to his current presentation and had been at his baseline level of health following infection. A T cell subset panel was obtained, which revealed an absolute CD3 count of 92 (reference range 840-3060), absolute CD4 count of 52 (reference range 500-1400), absolute CD8 count of 37 (reference range 180-1170), and a normal CD4: CD8 ratio. He was subsequently started on atovaquone for pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights the need for a high index of suspicion for lymphocyte depletion in older patients with multiple comorbidities who present during or after SARS-CoV-2 infection with atypical symptoms that are suggestive of immunosuppression. In such instances, there should be a low threshold to start prophylactic therapy for possible opportunistic infections.","Alebna, Bellamy, Tabur, Mangia","https://doi.org/10.12659/AJCR.937760","20221103","Male; Humans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Pneumonia, Pneumocystis; Cough","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40223,""
"Examining the factor structure of the DSM-5 Level 1 cross-cutting symptom measure","The DSM-5 Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure (DSM-XC) was developed by the American Psychiatric Association as a transdiagnostic mental health symptom survey. Despite its promise as a screening tool, few studies have assessed its latent dimensionality or provided guidance on interpreting responses. We examined the factor structure of the DSM-XC in a convenience sample of participants with varying degrees of psychopathology. Participants (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3533) were enrolled in an online study on the mental health impact of COVID-19 (NCT04339790). We used a factor analytic framework with exploratory and confirmatory analyses to evaluate candidate factor solutions. Convergent validity analysis with concurrent study measures was also performed. Six-factor and bifactor candidate solutions both had good fit and full measurement invariance across age, sex, and enrollment date. The six-factor solution resulted in constructs labeled as: mood, worry, activation, somatic, thought, and substance use. A general psychopathology factor and two residual factors (mood and anxiety constructs) explained the variance of the bifactor solution. Our analysis supports that the DSM-XC is a multidimensional instrument spanning many mental health symptoms. We provide scoring solutions for two factor structures that capture broader constructs of psychopathology. Use of a convenience sample may limit generalizability of findings.","Gibbons, Farmer, Shaw, Chung","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1953","20221103","COVID-19; clinical research; factor analysis; mental health; transdiagnostic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40224,""

"One-session treatment compared with multisession CBT in children aged 7-16 years with specific phobias: the ASPECT non-inferiority RCT","Up to 10% of children and young people have a specific phobia that can significantly affect their mental health, development and daily functioning. Cognitive-behavioural therapy-based interventions remain the dominant treatment, but limitations to their provision warrant investigation into low-intensity alternatives. One-session treatment is one such alternative that shares cognitive-behavioural therapy principles but has a shorter treatment period. This research investigated the non-inferiority of one-session treatment to cognitive-behavioural therapy for treating specific phobias in children and young people. The acceptability and cost-effectiveness of one-session treatment were examined. A pragmatic, multicentre, non-inferiority randomised controlled trial, with embedded economic and qualitative evaluations. There were 26 sites, including 12 NHS trusts. Participants were aged 7-16 years and had a specific phobia defined in accordance with established international clinical criteria. Participants were randomised 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°:Ã¢â‚¬â€°1 to receive one-session treatment or usual-care cognitive-behavioural therapy, and were stratified according to age and phobia severity. Outcome assessors remained blind to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was the Behavioural Avoidance Task at 6 months' follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the Anxiety Disorder Interview Schedule, Child Anxiety Impact Scale, Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale, a goal-based outcome measure, Child Health Utility 9D, EuroQol-5 Dimensions Youth version and resource usage. Treatment fidelity was assessed using the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Scale for Children and Young People and the One-Session Treatment Rating Scale. A total of 274 participants were recruited, with 268 participants randomised to one-session treatment (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°134) or cognitive-behavioural therapy (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°134). A total of 197 participants contributed some data, with 149 participants in the intention-to-treat analysis and 113 in the per-protocol analysis. Mean Behavioural Avoidance Task scores at 6 months were similar across treatment groups when both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were applied [cognitive-behavioural therapy: 7.1 (intention to treat), 7.4 (per protocol); one-session treatment: 7.4 (intention to treat), 7.6 (per protocol); on the standardised scale adjusted mean difference for cognitive-behavioural therapy compared with one-session treatment -0.123, 95% confidence interval -0.449 to 0.202 (intention to treat), mean difference -0.204, 95% confidence interval -0.579 to 0.171 (per protocol)]. These findings were wholly below the standardised non-inferiority limit of 0.4, which suggests that one-session treatment is non-inferior to cognitive-behavioural therapy. No between-group differences in secondary outcome measures were found. The health economics evaluation suggested that, compared with cognitive-behavioural therapy, one-session treatment marginally decreased the mean service use costs and maintained similar mean quality-adjusted life-year improvement. Nested qualitative evaluation found one-session treatment to be considered acceptable by those who received it, their parents/guardians and clinicians. No adverse events occurred as a result of phobia treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic meant that 48 children and young people could not complete the primary outcome measure. Service waiting times resulted in some participants not starting therapy before follow-up. One-session treatment for specific phobia in UK-based child mental health treatment centres is as clinically effective as multisession cognitive-behavioural therapy and highly likely to be cost-saving. Future work could involve improving the implementation of one-session treatment through training and commissioning of improved care pathways. This trial is registered as ISRCTN19883421. This project was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme and will be published in full in <i>Health Technology Assessment</i>; Vol. 26, No. 42. See the NIHR Journals Library website for further project information. A phobia is an intense, ongoing fear of an everyday object or situation. The phobia causes distress and the person with the phobia avoids that object or situation. Many children and young people have phobias that affect their daily lives. CognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy helps by changing what people do or think when they have a phobia and is the most common treatment approach. However, cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy is expensive, takes time and is not always easy to get. Different treatments are needed to help children and young people with specific phobias. One such therapy is one-session treatment, which works in similar ways to cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy but takes place over one main 3-hour session. Our study, called ASPECT (Alleviating Specific Phobias Experienced by Children Trial), compared these two treatments to examine whether or not one-session treatment is as effective as cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy. Overall, 274 children and young people aged 7Ã¢â‚¬â€œ16 years from 26 sites nationally helped with our research, of whom 268 received either cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy or one-session treatment. The results at 6 months found that one-session treatment and cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy worked as well as each other for treating phobias in children and young people. We also found evidence that one-session treatment is cheaper than cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy. We spoke with children and young people, their parents/guardians and the therapists of the single-session treatment, and we found one-session treatment to be acceptable for their needs. Future research could explore how to make one-session treatment more easily available for children and young people with specific phobias because it can save time and money, and works just as well as cognitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€œbehavioural therapy.","Wright, Tindall, Scott, Lee, Biggs, Cooper, Bee, Wang, Gega, Hayward, Solaiman, Teare, Davis, Lovell, Wilson, McMillan, Barr, Edwards, Lomas, Turtle, Parrott, Teige, Chater, Hargate, Ali, Parkinson, Gilbody, Marshall","https://doi.org/10.3310/IBCT0609","20221103","ADOLESCENT; ANXIETY; CHILD; COGNITIVEÃ¢â‚¬â€œBEHAVIOURAL THERAPY; COSTÃ¢â‚¬â€œBENEFIT ANALYSIS; MENTAL HEALTH; MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES; PHOBIC DISORDERS; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; Adolescent; Child; Humans; Pandemics; COVID-19; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Phobic Disorders; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Quality of Life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40226,""
"Exposure to nature during the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated effect on mental health: a systematic review with meta-analysis","The COVID-19 pandemic and measures such as lockdowns to control its transmission generated unique effects on psychological health and well-being. In these circumstances, access to nature and outdoor spaces became a potentially important coping strategy, but the evidence exploring the mental health benefits of nature exposure during different stages of the pandemic is mixed and poorly understood. We systematically synthesised the evidence to examine larger trends in associations between nature exposure and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We did a comprehensive keyword search in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycInfo for articles published between Jan 1, 2020 and April 30, 2022. We followed the PRISMA guidelines to synthesise and report results. Using the Navigation Guide systematic review methodology, we established the risk of bias in studies at the individual level and throughout the body of evidence for each outcome of interest. A total of 2004 relevant articles were initially identified and after screening for relevancy, 72 were included in the review. Studies found associations between green space visit frequency, green space accessibility, and type of green space (eg, indoor vs outdoor) with mental health outcomes (eg, depression and anxiety) during the pandemic. However, evidence for links between satellite image-driven measures of greenness (eg, normalised difference vegetation index) and mental health was scarce. Meta-analysis shows that access to gardens was associated with lower odds of depression (odds ratio 0Ã‚Â·71, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·61-0Ã‚Â·82, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and anxiety (0Ã‚Â·73, 0Ã‚Â·63-0Ã‚Â·84, I<sup>2</sup>=0%). Similarly, higher frequency of visits to green space was associated with improved mental wellbeing (0Ã‚Â·10, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·07-0Ã‚Â·14, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) and general mental health (0Ã‚Â·11, 95% CI 0Ã‚Â·03-0Ã‚Â·38, I<sup>2</sup>=82%). Interventions that prioritise nature-based infrastructure and emphasise exposure to nearby nature (eg, indoor plants or gardens), and visits to green spaces such as parks, could create more psychologically resilient communities in the face of future public health crises.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and earthquake on mental health of persons with severe mental illness: A survey study among people receiving community mental health care versus treatment as usual in Croatia","The COVID-19 pandemic led to the disruption of mental health services in most countries. Croatia has been developing and strengthening its mental health system, including the introduction of community mental health teams (CMHT) for persons with severe mental illness (SMI), whose implementation was ongoing during the pandemic through the RECOVER-E project. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in mental health outcomes, perceived social support and healthcare utilization in the group of participants receiving treatment as usual (TAU group) compared to the group receiving TAU and additional care by the CMHT (CMHT group) during the COVID-19 pandemic and two earthquakes. This is a cross-sectional survey administered among 90 participants with SMI at two time points: in May/June 2020 (first COVID-19 wave, earthquake) and in December 2020/January 2021 (second COVID-19 wave, earthquake). A significantly larger proportion of participants from the CMHT group visited the general practitioners in both waves of COVID-19 (first wave: CMHT 72.1%, TAU 44.2%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.009; second wave: CMHT 91.1%, TAU 64.1%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.003), as well as psychiatric services in the second wave (CMHT 95.3%, TAU 79.5%, <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.028). The use of long-acting injectables was also more frequent in the CMHT group (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.039). Furthermore, analysis of the first wave showed higher perceived support of significant others (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004) in the CMHT group. We did not identify any differences in mental health outcomes between groups in either wave. While mental health outcomes did not differ between TAU and CMHT group, people in CMHT used services and treatments more frequently than those in TAU during the pandemic, which may indicate that CMHT services enable the continuity and accessibility of care for people with SMI under the circumstances where standard care is interruped (for example pandemic, disaster conditions).","Levaj, Medved, GrubiÃ…Â¡in, TomaÃ…Â¡iÃ„â€¡, BroziÃ„â€¡, Shields-Zeeman, Bolinski, Rojnic Kuzman","https://doi.org/10.1177/00207640221130966","20221101","COVID-19; community mental health team; crisis; earthquake; severe mental illness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40228,""
"Exploring loss and grief during the COVID-19 pandemic: A scoping review of qualitative studies","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about multiple losses to various groups, namely patients, families and healthcare professionals. Grief, which is the reaction to these losses, could cause strain on these individuals' physical and mental health if not identified and managed early. This scoping review analysed loss, grief and how they were managed among these groups during the pandemic. This scoping review utilised the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) and the Joanna Briggs Institute framework for scoping reviews. Only qualitative studies relating to loss and grief and their management were included. Of 166 studies screened, 69 were included in the study. Qualitative analysis and data coding of each record were conducted through qualitative data analysis software. Losses included the death of family members, patients, colleagues and others. They also included the loss of usual routines, lifestyles and physical health. The grief experienced was multidimensional, affecting mainly the emotional, physical, social and existential realms. Anger, guilt and fear resulted from unsatisfactory farewells, issues with funerals, social isolation, financial strain and stigmatisation. Management strategies could be categorised into 5 themes: communication, finance, counselling, education and spiritual care. Loss and grief identification and management among patients, family members and healthcare professionals are critically important during this COVID-19 pandemic. Current operating guidelines have proven insufficient in managing loss and grief. Innovative strategies are essential to tackle the many dimensions of loss and grief. Nevertheless, further research is necessary to better understand the effectiveness of implemented policies.","Tao, Yu, Low","https://www.google.com/search?q=Exploring+loss+and+grief+during+the+COVID-19+pandemic:+A+scoping+review+of+qualitative+studies.","20221102","Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Grief; Qualitative Research; Health Personnel","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40229,""
"The Experience of Frontline Nurses during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Phenomenological Study","The purpose of this phenomenological study was to describe the experience of frontline nurses working during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first author conducted two individual audiotaped interviews with 23 qualified staff nurses. All the authors analyzed the professionally transcribed data according to hermeneutic principles. The researchers identified five major themes: (a) we are family; (b) heroes work here; (c) fear of contagion; (d) mental health and well-being; and (e) new reality. Given the uncertainties of working during the COVID-19 pandemic, findings revealed the value of supportive collegial relationships and the need to support the mental health and well-being needs of frontline nurses during the pandemic. Nurses need supportive environments to help ease the challenges associated with serving on the frontline during times of crisis. Findings have implications for future public health preparedness and response efforts.","Phillips, Alipio, Hoskins, Cohen","https://doi.org/10.1177/01939459221129944","20221101","COVID-19 pandemic; burnout; nursing staff; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40230,""
"Perception of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID 19 pandemic is far from over, and vaccines remain important tool for fighting the disease. As the preventive effects of the COVID-19 vaccine emerges, it is likely that the perception of importance and safety of vaccines have a positive effect on the acceptance of other vaccines. However, it is still unclear how COVID-19 pandemic has affected the general vaccination perception and acceptance. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the perception of HPV vaccination. This study involved an offline survey of 161 women aged between 20 and 49 years who visited the gynecologic clinic at Chung-nam National University Sejong Hospital from January 2021 to June 2021. The questionnaire consists of items related to experience and knowledge of COVID-19 and HPV viruses, as well as attitudes toward HPV vaccination. Knowledge about COVID-19 virus and HPV correlated positively with their experiences (PÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.011 and PÃ¢â‚¬â€¦=Ã¢â‚¬â€¦.045, respectively). Positive attitude was increased, and negative attitude was reduced toward HPV vaccination in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Participants stated that accurate information and cost reduction about HPV vaccine was needed to increase the HPV vaccination rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic era, positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination have tended to increase. To increase the HPV vaccination rate, public efforts are needed for further information and cost reduction.","Jung, Song, Shin, Chung, Park, Yoo","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000031389","20221102","Female; Humans; Young Adult; Adult; Middle Aged; COVID-19; Papillomavirus Infections; COVID-19 Vaccines; Pandemics; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Vaccination; Papillomaviridae; Surveys and Questionnaires; Perception; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40231,""
"Mental and physical health and well-being of canadian employees who were working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed various aspects of our lives, including how we work. Since the start of the pandemic, numerous organizations in Canada have mandated their employees to work from home (WFH) on a full-time basis. The rapid rise in the number of remote workers and the possibility for WFH continuing in the future signifies the importance of understanding the health and well-being of employees working from home over the course of the pandemic in Canada. We present the findings of two surveys (initial and 6-month follow-up) to examine the health and well-being of WFH employees during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. We analyzed the changes in mental and physical health and well-being of employees who were working from home between two time points during the pandemic. Initial survey was completed between October 2020 and December 2020 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1617); follow-up survey was completed between May 2021 and June 2021 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°382). We calculated the frequencies for survey questions involving demographics, WFH preferences, workstation setup training, employment situation, provision of hardware technologies, provision and usage of software technologies, and organization's return to work plan. We conducted Wilcoxon signed-rank tests to analyze the within-individual changes in mental and physical health and well-being of the 382 respondents who completed both the initial and follow-up surveys. Our analyses showed significant changes in various aspects of employee mental and physical health and well-being. Burnout, stress, general mental health, and job insecurity levels significantly decreased between the two time periods. Work-related sedentary behaviour reduced over time; however, the average proportion of time spent sitting during work hours was more than 80% in both surveys. Employees received more help and feedback from their colleagues and experienced a better sense of community with their co-workers over time. The findings can inform workers and organizations on the changes in mental and physical health and well-being of employees working from home during the pandemic. By understanding the changes in worker health and well-being, employers can develop effective strategies and implement policies that help protect employees' health and well-being.","Somasundram, Hackney, Yung, Du, Oakman, Nowrouzi-Kia, Yazdani","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14349-5","20221102","COPSOQ; National surveys; Remote work; Telework; Within-individual analysis; Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Canada; Mental Health; Employment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40232,""
"The COVID-19 pandemic's intersectional impact on work life, home life and wellbeing: an exploratory mixed-methods analysis of Georgia women's experiences during the pandemic","Women have been especially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. This exploratory study aimed to characterize women's adverse experiences related to their work, home lives, and wellbeing during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and to describe demographic differences of those lived experiences. Using the validated Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory, we collected data from reproductive-aged women in the state of Georgia about their exposure to adverse events during the pandemic. A latent class analysis (LCA) was performed to identify subgroups of women reporting similar adverse experiences and describe their sociodemographic characteristics. An optional open-ended question yielded qualitative data that were analyzed thematically and merged with subgroup findings. Data were collected from September 2020 to January 2021. 423 individuals aged 18-49 completed the survey with 314 (74.2%) providing qualitative responses. The LCA yielded 4 subgroups: (1) a ""low exposure"" subgroup (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°123, 29.1%) with relatively low probability of adverse experiences across domains (e.g. financial insecurity, health challenges, barriers to access to healthcare, intimate partner violence (IPV)); (2) a ""high exposure"" subgroup (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°46, 10.9%) with high probability of experiencing multiple adversities across domains including the loss of loved ones to COVID-19; (3) a ""caregiving stress"" subgroup (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°104, 24.6%) with high probability of experiencing challenges with home and work life including increased partner conflict; and (4) a ""mental health changes"" subgroup (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°150, 35.5%) characterized by relatively low probability of adverse experiences but high probability of negative changes in mental health and lifestyle. Individuals in subgroups 1 and 4, which had low probabilities of adverse experiences, were significantly more likely to be non-Hispanic white. Individuals in subgroup 2 were more likely to identify with a sexual or racial/ethnic minority population. Inductive coding of qualitative data yielded themes such as stress, mental health, financial impact, and adaptation/resilience, providing context for pandemic-related adversity. Though many individuals in our sample experienced hardship, minority populations were unequally impacted by pandemic-related adversity in work life, home life, and wellbeing. Recovery and future emergency preparedness efforts in Georgia must incorporate support mechanisms for mental health and IPV, focusing especially on the intersectional needs of racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities.","McCool-Myers, Grasso, Kozlowski, Cordes, Jean, Gold, Goedken","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14285-4","20221102","Adverse experience; COVID-19; Exposure; Female; Intimate partner violence; Latent class analysis; Mental health; Mixed methods; Stress; Female; Humans; Adult; Pandemics; COVID-19; Ethnicity; Georgia; Minority Groups; Intimate Partner Violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-11-03","",40233,""
