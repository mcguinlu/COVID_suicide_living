"Does pre-infection stress increase the risk of long COVID? Longitudinal associations between adversity worries and experiences in the month prior to COVID-19 infection and the development of long COVID and specific long COVID symptoms","BackgroundLong COVID is increasingly recognised as public health burden. Demographic and infection-related characteristics have been identified as risk factors, but less research has focused on psychosocial predictors such as stress immediately preceding the index infection. Research on whether stressors predict the development of specific long COVID symptoms is also lacking.

MethodsData from 1,966 UK adults who had previously been infected with COVID-19 and who took part in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study were analysed. The number of adversity experiences (e.g., job loss) and the number of worries about adversity experiences within the month prior to COVID-19 infection were used to predict the development of self-reported long COVID and the presence of three specific long COVID symptoms (difficulty with mobility, cognition, and self-care). The interaction between a three-level index of socio-economic position (SEP; with higher values indicating lower SEP) and the exposure variables in relation to long COVID status was also examined. Analyses controlled for a range of COVID-19 infection characteristics, socio-demographics, and health-related factors.

FindingsOdds of self-reported long COVID increased by 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04 to 1.51) for each additional worry about adversity in the month prior to COVID-19 infection. Although there was no evidence for an interaction between SEP and either exposure variable, individuals in the lowest SEP group were nearly twice as likely to have developed long COVID as those in the highest SEP group (OR: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.19 to 3.19) and worries about adversity experiences remained a predictor of long COVID (OR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.98). The number of worries about adversity experiences also corresponded with increased odds of certain long COVID symptoms such as difficulty with cognition (e.g., difficulty remembering or concentrating) by 1.46 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.09) but not with mobility (e.g., walking or climbing steps) or self-care (e.g., washing all over or dressing).

InterpretationResults suggest a key role of stress in the time preceding the acute COVID-19 infection for the development of long COVID and for difficulty with cognition specifically. These findings point to the importance of mitigating worries and experiences of adversities during pandemics both to reduce their psychological impact but also help reduce the societal burden of longer-term illness.

"Loneliness and Depression among Community Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Social isolation has been recommended for reducing older adults' mortality and severe cases of COVID illness. That has resulted in unavoidable consequences of mental ill-health. This study aimed to examine the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on the development of loneliness and depression and to analyse the factors associated with these conditions among community-dwelling older adults in Jordan. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a random sample of 456 community older adults contacted by telephone three weeks after the first pandemic lockdown in April 2020. The study instrument included the screening three-item UCLA Loneliness Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and relevant medical and functional history. The mean age was 72.48Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.84Ã¢â‚¬â€°years, and 50.2% were women. 41.4% were lonely, and of those 62% had a positive screen for depression. The mean UCLA score was significantly higher during the lockdown than before. Loneliness was significantly associated with being unmarried, having never worked previously, and being functionally dependent. Lonely participants were 1.65 times more likely to have depression. Likewise, a previous history of depression and cognitive impairment, multimorbidity, poor self-perceived health, and concern about contracting COVID infection were significant predictors of depression. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a heavy toll on older adults' mental health, particularly those with multimorbidity, baseline functional dependence, and those with a previous history of depression and cognitive impairment. Targeting these high-risk groups is important in order to minimize loneliness, depression, and subsequent increased morbidity. Using all-inclusive language might minimize ageism and the fear of catching an infection.","Alhalaseh, Kasasbeh, Al-Bayati, Haikal, Obeidat, Abuleil, Wilkinson","https://doi.org/10.1111/psyg.12833","20220409","COVID-19; depression; loneliness; older/elderly; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","",29863,""
"Research on the influencing factors of fatigue and professional identity among CDC workers in China: an online cross-sectional study","This study aimed to investigate the status quo and the influencing factors of fatigue and professional identity among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) workers in China during the pandemic. A cross-sectional design. CDC workers employed by the Liaoning CDC system were enrolled (administrative staffs were excluded). 1020 CDC workers. Fatigue scores and professional identity scores. Postcompetency scores, respect scores, occupational stress scores, resilience scores and self-efficacy scores. The average scores of fatigue and professional identity were 8.23, 38.88, respectively. Factors including perceived public respect (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.129, p&lt;0.01), resilience (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.104, p&lt;0.05) and self-efficacy (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.22, p&lt;0.01) were negatively associated with fatigue. Educational background (bachelor vs junior college or below) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.105, p&lt;0.01), (master or above vs junior college or below) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.092, p&lt;0.05), workplace (county vs district) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.067, p&lt;0.05), (city vs district) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.085, p&lt;0.05), fighting the COVID-19 on the front line (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.059, p&lt;0.05) and occupational stress (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.166, p&lt;0.01) were positively correlated with fatigue. Educational background (bachelor vs junior college or below) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.097, p&lt;0.01), (master or above vs junior college or below) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.114, p&lt;0.01), workplace (city vs district) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.114, p&lt;0.01), fighting the COVID-19 on the front line (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.047, p&lt;0.05) and occupational stress (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=-0.105, p&lt;0.01) were negatively associated with professional identity. Factors including postcompetency (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.362, p&lt;0.01), perceived public respect (general vs low) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.219, p&lt;0.01), (high vs low) (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.288, p&lt;0.01), resilience (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.097, p&lt;0.05) and self-efficacy (<i>ÃŽÂ²</i>=0.113, p&lt;0.01) were positively connected with professional identity. The fatigue among the CDC workers was at a higher level. The level of professional identity was high, and administrators should take measures to alleviate fatigue and maintain professional identity. In addition, methods aiming to attenuate occupational stress, and improve resilience and self-efficacy should be immediately put into action.","Cui, Liu, Hao, Li, Liu, Chenxin, Zhang, Wu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058762","20220409","depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","",29864,""
"Mental health and health-related quality of life among healthcare workers in Indonesia during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are more exposed to COVID-19 than other professions. Studies from other countries have shown that the mental health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of HCWs were affected during this pandemic. However, studies on mental health in Indonesia remain scarce and no study has evaluated the HRQoL among HCWs. Thus, this study was designed to explore the mental health status and HRQoL among HCWs in Indonesia. This was a cross-sectional study. This was an open online survey in Indonesia conducted from December 2020 to February 2021. This study involved HCWs who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 502 respondents who accessed the online questionnaire, 392 were included in the analysis. Mental health status was measured using the 21-item Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and HRQoL was measured using the second version of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF12v2). The prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress among HCWs was 29.4%, 44.9% and 31.8%, respectively. Using the SF12v2 questionnaire, 354 (90.3%) HCWs were found to have impaired physical component and 156 (39.8%) HCWs have impaired mental component. The prevalence of mental health problems among HCWs was high in Indonesia. HRQoL, particularly the physical component, was affected in most HCWs. Thus, policymakers should give more attention to the mental health and HRQoL of HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Syamlan, Salamah, Alkaff, Prayudi, Kamil, Irzaldy, Karimah, Postma, Purba, Arifin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057963","20220409","COVID-19; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MENTAL HEALTH; PUBLIC HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","",29865,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on diagnoses of common mental health disorders in adults in Catalonia, Spain: a population-based cohort study","To investigate how trends in incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Population-based cohort study. Retrospective cohort study from 2018 to 2021 using the Information System for Research in Primary Care (SIDIAP) database in Catalonia, Spain. 3Ã¢â‚¬â€°640Ã¢â‚¬â€°204 individuals aged 18 or older in SIDIAP on 1 March 2018 with no history of anxiety and depressive disorders. The incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders during the prelockdown period (March 2018-February 2020), lockdown period (March-June 2020) and postlockdown period (July 2020-March 2021) was calculated. Forecasted rates over the COVID-19 periods were estimated using negative binomial regression models based on prelockdown data. The percentage of reduction was estimated by comparing forecasted versus observed events, overall and by sex, age and socioeconomic status. The incidence rates per 100Ã¢â‚¬â€°000 person-months of anxiety and depressive disorders were 151.1 (95% CI 150.3 to 152.0) and 32.3 (31.9 to 32.6), respectively, during the prelockdown period. We observed an increase of 37.1% (95% prediction interval 25.5 to 50.2) in incident anxiety diagnoses compared with the expected in March 2020, followed by a reduction of 15.8% (7.3 to 23.5) during the postlockdown period. A reduction in incident depressive disorders occurred during the lockdown and postlockdown periods (45.6% (39.2 to 51.0) and 22.0% (12.6 to 30.1), respectively). Reductions were higher among women during the lockdown period, adults aged 18-34 years and individuals living in the most deprived areas. The COVID-19 pandemic in Catalonia was associated with an initial increase in anxiety disorders diagnosed in primary care but a reduction in cases as the pandemic continued. Diagnoses of depressive disorders were lower than expected throughout the pandemic.","RaventÃƒÂ³s, Pistillo, Reyes, FernÃƒÂ¡ndez-BertolÃƒÂ­n, AragÃƒÂ³n, Berenguera, Jacques-AviÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³, Medina-Perucha, Burn, Duarte-Salles","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057866","20220409","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; epidemiology; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","",29866,""
"Family bereavement care interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to daily social routines and to the lived experience of bereaved families. This article outlines the protocol for a scoping review of published studies to evaluate psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions intended to help family carers adjust to grief, loss and bereavement due to COVID-19. This review addresses one broad research question: 'What do we know about bereavement support interventions for family carers of COVID-19 victims?' The seminal framework by Arksey and O'Malley will guide the review process, which will cover both the qualitative and quantitative scientific literature on grief support during COVID-19. We will search for relevant studies in several databases, namely PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, Scopus and Directory of Open Access Journals. Moreover, we will search the reference lists of included studies and grey literature sources. The database search will be limited to studies from February 2020 (first death by COVID-19) to 1 January 2022. Only literature written in English, Portuguese and Spanish shall be included. Two independent reviewers will screen the literature, select articles and extract data, in an iterative process. Any disagreements will be solved through consensus-based discussion. Results will be reported with descriptive statistics, accompanied by a thematic analysis. The study will use information acquired from previously published papers and hence does not require ethical approval. This protocol is registered with the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/bw7fn/). Scoping results will be disseminated via posters and oral presentations to both academic and clinical audiences, as well as through peer-reviewed journals.","Laranjeira, Moura, Marcon, Jaques, Salci, Carreira, Cuman, Querido","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057767","20220409","Adult psychiatry; COVID-19; MENTAL HEALTH","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","",29867,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pediatric developmental services: a cross-sectional study on overall burden and mental health status","The COVID-19 outbreak has taken a heavy toll on the mental well-being of healthcare workers, even those who have not been directly involved in the care of acutely ill patients. The aims of this study were to identify the overall burden and mental health status of healthcare workers in pediatric developmental services under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify the risk and protective factors associated with mental health. This cross-sectional web-based study was part of a large multicenter VOICE study conducted among employees ((neuro-)pediatricians, psychologists, speech therapists, occupational therapists, etc.) from various pediatric developmental services between June and July 2020. A total of 1291 questionnaires regarding overall burden, mental health status (depression, generalized anxiety disorder and emotional exhaustion) and risk and protective factors for mental health (working conditions, potential problems during the COVID-19 pandemic and psychological resources) were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression were used for data analysis. A total of 44.5% (574/1291) participants felt a high or very high overall burden during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of all the participants, 14.6% (171/1173) reported clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms, 17.0% (199/1173) reported generalized anxiety disorder symptoms and 44.6% (532/1192) reported emotional exhaustion. Multiple linear regression analyses identified several common risk and protective factors for mental health status variables. The burden of an increase in the quantity of work, fear of work and fear of becoming infected showed the strongest negative associations, whereas psychological resources and sufficient relaxation in leisure time exhibited the strongest positive associations. Employees who were not directly involved in the care of acutely ill patients were also exposed to considerable stress, some of which was not different from that experienced by professionals who were directly affected. These employees should not be lost sight of and must be offered appropriate support.","Borusiak, Mazheika, Bauer, Haberlandt, Krois, Fricke, Simon, Beschoner, Jerg-Bretzke, Geiser, Hiebel, Weidner, Albus, Morawa, Erim","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13690-022-00876-5","20220409","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Developmental pediatrics; Mental health; Psychological strain","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-04-10","",29868,""
