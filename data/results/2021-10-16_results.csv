"Mobile shoppersâ€™ response to Covid-19 phobia, pessimism and smartphone addiction: Does social influence matter?","Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a variety of changes identified in customersâ€™ shopping behaviours, and development of new practices as a response to the crisis. The purpose of this research is to examine the effects of Covid-19 phobia, and news exposure on individualsâ€™ psychological states, and their resulting mobile shopping behaviour. Relying upon the Activate, Belief and Consequences (ABC) model of the Cognitive-Behaviour Theory, this research applies the partial least square structural modelling (PLS-SEM) methodology for analysing the data from 302 mobile shoppers from India. The results confirm that Covid-19 phobia and Covid-19 news exposure are substantial determinants of consumersâ€™ smartphone addictive use and pessimism, which in turn affect mobile shopping frequency. Additionally, social influence is found to play a vital role in moderating mobile shopping frequency for individuals, who experience smartphone addiction. The current study is a pioneering effort to examine the influence of Covid-19-induced phobia on consumers' psychological states and their subsequent impact on their mobile shopping frequency. The study provides several contributions to theory and practice within the areas of technology use and mobile shopping in particular.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2021.121249","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-16","",18884,""
"Factors associated with nurses emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background Nurses are among the frontline healthcare workers directly impacted by the burden of the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of emotional distress and the associated factors among nurses practicing in South Dakota during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods An online survey was conducted among practicing, licensed nurses in South Dakota during the pandemic (July 2020 â€“ August 2020). Emotional distress was measured using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Logistic regression models were performed to examine the association of emotional distress and the three DASS-21 subscales with: sociodemographic and work environment factors (e.g., work setting, job satisfaction, number of COVID-19 cases seen at the facility, preparedness, concerns with worsening pre-exiting mental health conditions due to the pandemic, and contracting the illness). Results Among 1505 participants, overall emotional distress was reported by 22.2%, while anxiety, depression and stress were 15.8%, 14.5% and 11.9%, respectively. Factors associated with moderate to severe emotional distress, depression, anxiety, and stress were as follows: concerns for worsening of pre-existing mental health conditions, job dissatisfaction, encountering higher number of COVID-19 cases at one's work facility, feeling unprepared for the pandemic, and concern for contracting the illness (all pÂ <Â 0.05). Conclusions Our study suggests a high prevalence of emotional distress among nurses and highlights the factors associated with emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Promoting appropriate support is imperative to reduce nurses' emotional distress and promote psychological well-being during the COVID-19 world health crisis and in future pandemics.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151502","20211201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-16","",18885,""

"From stress to stigma â€“ Mental health considerations of health care workers involved in COVID19 management","Background Healthcare workers (HCWs) involved in administration and patient management during COVID-19 pandemic are at high risk of developing psychological problems related to fear and stress of contacting COVID infection. This is augmented by the stigma faced at home and society, owing to the nature of their job. Aim To assess the mental health issues and stigma amongst health care workers involved in COVID care. Methodology We conducted a hospital based cross sectional study where 150 health care workers involved in the care of COVID-19 patients, directly and indirectly, were selected using systematic random sampling. They were assessed using Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) Hindi Version, The Impact of Event Scale - Revised scale and a Modified Stigma scale. Results Significant psychological stress, anxiety, depression and high risk for developing post-traumatic stress disorder was found in more than half of the healthcare workers, albeit more in those having direct contact with COVID patients (pÂ <Â 0.05). Stigma was significantly reported in most HCWs, especially with concerns regarding public attitude and disclosure of their work profile. Conclusion Healthcare Workers are at a higher risk for developing psychological disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder because of the immensely stressful work-related conditions and stigma related to working with COVID patients. This may lead to long lasting psychosocial consequences which may affect more severely than the infection itself. Early identification of psychological issues of HCWs and timely intervention is the key.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijtb.2021.09.007","20210101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-16","",18889,""
