"A Self-Immolative Fluorescent Probe for Selective Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Main Protease","Existing tools to detect and visualize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) suffer from low selectivity, poor cell permeability, and high cytotoxicity. Here we report a novel self-immolative fluorescent probe (MP590) for the highly selective and sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M<sup>pro</sup>). This fluorescent probe was prepared by connecting a M<sup>pro</sup>-cleavable peptide (<i>N</i>-acetyl-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln) with a fluorophore (<i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., resorufin) via a self-immolative aromatic linker. Fluorescent titration results show that MP590 can detect M<sup>pro</sup> with a limit of detection (LoD) of 35 nM and is selective over interferents such as hemoglobin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), thrombin, amylase, SARS-CoV-2 papain-like protease (PL<sup>pro</sup>), and trypsin. The cell imaging data indicate that this probe can report M<sup>pro</sup> in HEK 293T cells transfected with a M<sup>pro</sup> expression plasmid as well as in TMPRSS2-VeroE6 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our results suggest that MP590 can both measure and monitor M<sup>pro</sup> activity and quantitatively evaluate M<sup>pro</sup> inhibition in infected cells, making it an important tool for diagnostic and therapeutic research on SARS-CoV-2.","Xu, Zhou, Cheng, Jin, Clark, He, Yim, Li, Chang, Wu, FajtovÃƒÂ¡, O'Donoghue, Carlin, Todd, Jokerst","https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c02381","20220816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36158,""
"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people with HIV in Victoria, Australia: 1 year later","In the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, Australia had under 30,000 COVID-19 cases. Formerly stringent public health measures are now relaxed and vaccinations are available. We compared pandemic impacts on Victorians with HIV (PWHIV) over time. Two surveys were developed with HIV stakeholder groups appraising demographics, concern, and pandemic impacts. The latter included vaccination, mental health, and quality of life questions. Recruitment was through social media and Alfred and Monash Health HIV-clinics (first survey 26/8/2020 to 26/11/2020, second survey 30/10/2021 to 31/1/2022). The surveys had 153 and 95 respondents, respectively. Demographics were similar. Most reported negatively impacted mental health (68%). Most (56%) required mental health services, of these, 39% could not access them. Rates of concern increased. Ninety percent had two COVID-19 vaccinations. Both surveys demonstrated HIV and non-HIV-care provision. PWHIV reported concern and negative impacts. Improved mental health services access is needed to optimize PWHIV quality of life.","Weerasuria, Ko, Ehm, O'Bryan, McMahon, Woolley, Hoy, Lau","https://doi.org/10.1089/AID.2022.0048","20220816","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36159,""
"Use of preventive measures, beliefs and information received about COVID-19 and their effects on mental health, in two stages of the pandemic in Colombia","Several studies have highlighted the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on both physical and mental health. The aim of this study is to analyse the effects on mental health in two phases of the COVID-19 pandemic (April 2020 and February 2021) in the population of Colombia. Observational, prospective, cross-sectional study along two periods, April 2020 and February 2021. The sample (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1309) was extracted from the Colombian population, only including individuals over the age of 18 and residing in Colombia during the pandemic. The IMPACTCOVID-19 questionnaire was used, previously validated in Spain and cross-culturally adapted to the Colombian population, which included sociodemographic data, use of preventive measures, information received and the Goldberg General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) for psychological distress (PD). Participants had to sign an informed consent before taking part in the investigation. A higher level of PD was observed among women (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.99, SD = 3.39) (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), in those who lived without a partner (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.83, SD = 3.47) (<i>p</i> = .036), and in those with a worse perception of health (<i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.27, SD = 3.51) (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). PD decreased in the second period from <i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.99 (SD = 3.36) to <i>M</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.98 (SD = 3.30) (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), coinciding with a higher use of preventive measures, less distress caused by COVID-19 and greater confidence in healthcare professionals and clinical structures. In the second period, the time spent in getting informed decreased, but the sources of information were the same, principally social media and official sources. Better information on the effects and preventive measures to prevent the pandemic improves confidence in the health system and its professionals, reducing the level of PD. There is a need for quality information on social networks and an adaptation of telemedicine to address the pandemic effects on mental health.Key messagesPsychological distress (PD) decreased in February 2021, as compared to April 2020, due to a greater use of preventive measures against COVID-19, and the confidence on the recommendations made by health officials and professionals.Higher PD has been found in women and people who lived without a partner, in line with studies performed in other countries.The accessibility to quality information on the pandemic should be promoted by the Official Health Authorities, thus counteracting data that could be classified as ""fake news"".","GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado, Pomares-Herrera, Fagundo-Rivera, Ortega-Moreno, GarcÃƒÂ­a-Iglesias, Ruiz-Frutos","https://doi.org/10.1080/07853890.2022.2109057","20220816","COVID-19; Psychological distress; information; knowledge; mental health; preventive measures; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36160,""
"The positive role of parental attachment and communication in Chinese adolescents' health behavior and mental health during COVID-19","Given that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has largely influenced adolescents' physical and mental health around the globe, it is important to identify protective factors that may promote adolescents' positive adjustment during the pandemic. This study aimed to examine the role of parental attachment and COVID-19 communication in adolescents' health behavior and mental health during COVID-19. A total of 442 Chinese parent-adolescent dyads (mean age of adolescentsÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.35 years; 50% girls) completed two-wave longitudinal surveys over the span of 2 months during the pandemic (Wave 1: July 2020; Wave 2: September 2020). At each wave, adolescents reported on their COVID-19-related health behavior, general health behavior, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms. At Wave 1, parent-adolescent attachment security and COVID-19 communication were also assessed. Adolescents' attachment security to parents was associated with their increased COVID-19-related and general health behavior as well as decreased depression and anxiety over 2 months during COVID-19. Moreover, more frequent parent-adolescent COVID-19 communication was associated with adolescents' increased COVID-19-related and general health behavior over time. Notably, attachment security's and COVID-19 communication's associations with health behavior largely remained the same after taking into account both factors simultaneously. In addition, results from exploratory analyses suggest that more frequent COVID-19 communication mediates the link between attachment security and increased health behavior. These findings highlight the importance of promoting attachment security and COVID-19 communication between parents and adolescents during the pandemic, which may play a positive role in adolescents' health behavior and mental health.","Yang, Chen, Qu, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1002/jad.12085","20220816","COVID-19; adolescents; attachment; health behavior; mental health; parent-child communication","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36161,""
"Profiles of Burnout and Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Among General Surgery Residents at a Large Academic Training Program","COVID-19 has placed demands on General Surgery residents, who are already at high risk of burnout. This study examined the pandemic's impact on burnout and wellness among General Surgery residents at a large training program. General Surgery residents at our institution completed a survey focused on self-reported burnout, mental health, perceptions of wellness resources, and changes in activities during the pandemic. Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). Unsupervised machine learning (<i>k-means</i> clustering) was used to identify profiles of burnout and comparisons between profiles were made. Of 82 eligible residents, 51 completed the survey (62% response rate). During COVID-19, 63% of residents had self-described burnout, 43% had depression, 18% acknowledged binge drinking/drug use, and 8% had anxiety. There were no significant differences from pre-pandemic levels (<i>p</i> all &gt;.05). Few residents perceived available wellness resources as effective (6%). Based on MBI scores, the clustering analysis identified three clusters, characterized as ""overextended"", ""engaged"", and ""ineffective"". Engaged residents had the least concerning MBI scores and were significantly more likely to exercise, retain social contact during the pandemic, and had less self-reported anxiety or depression. Research residents were overrepresented in the ineffective cluster (46%), which had high rates of self-reported burnout (77%) and was characterized by the lowest personal accomplishment scores. Rates of self-reported burnout for overextended and engaged residents were 73% and 48%, respectively. Surgical residents have high rates of self-reported burnout and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clusters of burnout may offer targets for individualized intervention.","Nguyen, Castelo, Greene, Lu, Brar, Reel, Cil","https://doi.org/10.1177/15533506221120145","20220816","COVID-19; burnout; general surgery; internship and residency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36162,""
"Impact of confinement measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic on people living with dementia and their caregivers in Spain","The COVID-19 pandemic has particularly affected people living with dementia (PLWD) and their caregivers, who have seen their access to social support services and opportunities for socialisation limited. The objective of the study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 on PLWD and their caregivers in Spain. An online survey was conducted between November 27, 2020, and January 19, 2021, that explored compliance with prevention guidelines, changes at the family level and in access to social support services. Instruments were included to estimate levels of anxiety and depression. The survey was answered by 229 people (161 current caregivers, 54 former caregivers, 13 formal caregivers and 1 person with dementia). Analysis of the current and former caregivers showed that they felt well informed, although they find it difficult for PLWD to comply with prevention guidelines. The use of social support services was reduced and the difficulty of access to social and health services increased, there was a negative impact on the economic situation and family relationships, with an increase in perceived overload. In addition, caregivers of PLWD scored above the cut-off points in the tests used to assess depression and anxiety, although the results of the multiple regression analysis do not allow us to conclude that the loss of resources influences the anxiety and depression scores. The negative impact of the pandemic on caregivers of PLWD is verified. It is necessary to adapt social support services and design strategies to maintain the provision of support to these vulnerable groups.","GarcÃƒÂ­a Santelesforo, RodrÃƒÂ­guez Del Rey, PÃƒÂ©rez-SÃƒÂ¡ez, PelÃƒÂ¡ez HernÃƒÂ¡ndez","https://doi.org/10.1111/hsc.13960","20220816","Alzheimer's disease; COVID-19; caregivers; confinement; dementia; social care; social support services","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36163,""

"The relationship between leisure activities and mental health: The impact of resilience and COVID-19","Engaging in leisure activities promotes mental health. The effect is likely associated with resilience as the broaden-and-build theory suggests positive emotions elicited from leisure increase mental resources for stress coping. The present research examined whether participating in different leisure activities at a given time increases the level of resilience, which in turn reduces psychological problems. It also investigated the changes in people's leisure activities due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the impact of these changes on their mental health. Japanese participants (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°300) responded to two online surveys conducted before (January 2020) and after the outbreak (February 2021). They selected the leisure activities they had engaged in from 100 choices and reported their levels of resilience and depressive symptoms. An analysis of covariates revealed that the total number of selected activities significantly reduced in the second survey, but the levels of resilience and depressive symptoms remained constant. Regression analysis showed that the reduction in leisure activities did not predict depressive symptoms. However, structural equation modeling established that the relationship between leisure and depression was mediated by resilience, supporting the initial hypothesis. Importantly, this relationship slightly differed by age group, likely because popular activities and their psychological impacts vary depending on age.","Takiguchi, Matsui, Kikutani, Ebina","https://doi.org/10.1111/aphw.12394","20220816","COVID-19; leisure activities; mental health; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36165,""

The subjects of this study were 318 medical students in Daegu who voluntarily participated in an online test using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Impact of Event Scale-Revised Korean version. As a result of the test, risk students received immediate telephone counseling, and the effect of this telephone counseling was analyzed. There were no differences in depression, anxiety, or stress according to gender and grade. As a result of immediate telephone counseling for risk students, significant differences were found in depression, anxiety, and stress, and the counseling was found to be effective. For medical students who are easily exposed to stress, the importance of psychological prevention measures and effectiveness of non-face-to-face counseling should be recognized.

"Home Quarantine: A Double-Edged Sword During COVID-19 Pandemic for Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and the Related Complications","COVID-19 pandemic and worldwide quarantine seriously affected the physical and mental health of the general public. Our study aimed to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). This single-center retrospective cohort study collected complete clinical data of HDP patients with a history of home quarantine in The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University (Chongqing, China) in 2020 as well as the patients without home quarantine in 2018 and 2019. Then, the maternal and neonatal outcomes of two subtypes of HDP, gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia/eclampsia (PE/E), were analyzed over the three years. The incidence of HDP increased from 0.84% in 2018 and 0.51% in 2019 to 2.30% in 2020. The data suggested that home quarantine was associated with higher gestational weight gain, obesity rates, blood pressure, and uric acid among the patients with HDP in 2020. Furthermore, HDP patients with a history of home quarantine may have worse neonatal outcomes, including lower newborn weight, shorter body length, lower Apgar score, and higher risk of fetal growth restriction. Our results suggested that COVID-19 quarantine may be a risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes in HDP patients. Lifestyle guidance and antenatal care may be necessary for HDP patients with home quarantine in an epidemic outbreak.","Cai, Yang, Wang, Cui, Wu, Liao, Luo, Liu","https://doi.org/10.2147/DMSO.S374482","20220816","COVID-19; HDP; home quarantine; obesity; pregnancy outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36167,""

"Coping with stress during the COVID-19 pandemic in the oldest-old population","The aim of the study is to investigate psychosocial factors that are associated with positive and negative coping with stress, as well as with worries about and perceived threat by COVID-19 to enable us to provide adequate support for oldest-old individuals. A paper-pencil-based survey assessed COVID-19 worries and perceived threat, depression, anxiety, somatization, social support, loneliness, resilience, positive and negative coping in a sample of <i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°197 oldest-old individuals (78-100Ã‚Â years). Linear multivariate and binary logistic regression analyses were conducted. Individuals with high levels of resilience were more likely to feel self-efficient when coping with stress. High levels of depression, anxiety and loneliness were associated with feeling more helpless when coping with stress. However, oldest-old individuals who felt lonely also experienced situations where they felt competent in stress coping. Being male and experiencing high levels of social support was more likely associated with high levels of worries due to COVID-19. Increased age and higher levels of depression were associated with lower levels of perceived personal threat, whereas higher somatization scores were more likely associated with higher perceived personal threat. Findings suggest that mental health factors may shape the way oldest-old individuals cope with pandemic-related stress. Resilience might be an important factor to take into account when targeting an improvement in positive coping with stress. Oldest-old individuals who have higher levels of depression, anxiety and feel lonely may be supported by adapting their coping skill repertoire to reduce the feeling of helplessness when coping with stress.","Gerhards, Pabst, RÃƒÂ¶hr, Luppa, Riedel-Heller","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10433-022-00719-w","20220816","COVID-19 pandemic; Coping; Mental health; Old age; Public health; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36169,""

"Cutting down, quitting and motivation to stop smoking by self-reported COVID-19 status: Representative cross-sectional surveys in England","To examine the association of self-reported COVID-19 disease status with cutting down, past-month and past-year quit attempts, and motivation to stop smoking. Repeat cross-sectional survey, representative of the adult population in England. Past-year smokers, n=3,338 (aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18y) responding between May 2020 and April 2021. Outcomes were i) currently cutting down, ii) having made a quit attempt in the past month, iii) having made a quit attempt in the past year and, iv) motivation to stop smoking. The explanatory variable was self-reported COVID-19 disease status (belief in never vs. ever had COVID-19). Covariates included age, sex, occupational grade, region, children in the household, alcohol use and survey month. Of past-year smokers, 720 (21.6%) reported past COVID-19 infection and 48 (1.4%) reported current COVID-19 infection. In adjusted analyses, rates of currently cutting down (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.34), past-year quit attempts (AOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82-1.19), and motivation to stop smoking (AOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.89-1.23) were comparable in those who did and did not report ever having had COVID-19. People who reported ever having had COVID-19 had 39% higher odds than those without of attempting to quit in the past month, but the confidence interval contained the possibility of no difference (AOR 1.39, 95% CI 0.94-2.06) and for some the quit attempt may have occurred before they had COVID-19. During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in England, rates of reducing smoking and attempting to quit in the past year were similar in smokers who did or did not self-report ever having had COVID-19. There was also little difference in motivation to stop smoking between groups.

This ecological study aimed to investigate the correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and the epidemiological indicators of COVID-19, including the cumulative incidence rate of cases, the cumulative incidence rate of death, performed COVID-19 tests per million, recovery rate, and case fatality rate. In this ecological study, a data set was provided, which included the epidemiologic indices of COVID-19, HDI, and its components for each country. Correlation coefficients were used to determine linear correlation. Also, the scatter plots of the HDI for the studied countries based on the epidemiologic indices of COVID-19 were drawn. This study showed that HDI and its components had positive correlation with a cumulative incidence rate of cases, the cumulative incidence rate of death, and performed COVID-19 tests (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). HDI and two of its components, including literacy and Gross National Income (GNI) components had negative correlation with case fatality rate (CFR). Also, HDI and two of its components, including literacy and life expectancy components had negative correlation with recovery rate. Our study showed that the HDI and its components can affect the epidemiological status of COVID-19. As HDI increased, the cumulative incidence rate of cases, cumulative incidence rate of death, and COVID-19 tests increased as well. As HDI increased, CFR and recovery rate decreased as well.

Personalized medicine is expected to play a pivotal role in assessing disease risk or predicting response to treatment, understanding a person's health status, and, therefore, health care decision-making. This work discusses electrochemical biosensors for monitoring multiparametric biomarkers at different molecular levels and their potential to elucidate the health status of an individual in a personalized manner. In particular, and as an illustration, we discuss several aspects of the infection produced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) as a current health care concern worldwide. This includes SARS-CoV-2 structure, mechanism of infection, biomarkers, and electrochemical biosensors most commonly explored for diagnostics, prognostics, and potentially assessing the risk of complications in patients in the context of personalized medicine. Finally, some concluding remarks and perspectives hint at the use of electrochemical biosensors in the frame of other cutting-edge converging/emerging technologies toward the inauguration of a new paradigm of personalized medicine.","VÃƒÂ¡squez, Orozco","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-022-04237-7","20220815","Biomarkers; COVID-19; Electrochemical biosensor; Personalized medicine; SARS-CoV-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36173,""

"SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and implications for vaccination","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for more than 500 million cases worldwide as of April 2022. Initial estimates in 2020 found that children were less likely to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 and more likely to be asymptomatic or display mild COVID-19 symptoms. Our early understanding of COVID-19 transmission and disease in children led to a range of public health measures including school closures that have indirectly impacted child health and wellbeing. The emergence of variants of concern (particularly Delta and Omicron) has raised new issues about transmissibility in children, as preliminary data suggest that children may be at increased risk of infection, especially if unvaccinated. Global national prevalence data show that SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents is rising due to COVID-19 vaccination among adults and increased circulation of Delta and Omicron variants. To mitigate this, childhood immunisation programmes are being implemented globally to prevent direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 including severe complications (e.g., MIS-C), debilitating long-COVID symptoms, and the indirect impacts of prolonged community and school closures on childhood education, social and behavioural development and mental health. This review explores the current state of knowledge on COVID-19 in children including COVID-19 vaccination strategies. IMPACT: Provides an up-to-date account of SARS-CoV-2 infections in children. Discusses the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 in children. Provides the latest information on the current state of global COVID-19 vaccination in children.","Nathanielsz, Toh, Do, Mulholland, Licciardi","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-022-02254-x","20220815","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36175,""
"Trajectories of posttraumatic distress after smoke exposure during a coalmine fire: An analysis of risk and protective factors","In 2014, the coalmine adjacent to the Hazelwood power station in the Latrobe Valley, Australia caught fire and distributed a large volume of toxic smoke into the surrounding community over 45 days. This study investigated risk and protective factors associated with four trajectories of posttraumatic distress (resilience; in-recovery; delayed-onset; chronic) in the affected community. A sample comprising 709 adults participated in two survey rounds, conducted in 2016-2017 and 2019-2020. Participantsâ€™ exposure to mine fire-related particulate matter (PM2.5) during the event, sociodemographic circumstances, physical and mental health histories, prior trauma, and exposure to recent stressful events were assessed. Mine fire-related posttraumatic distress was measured using the Impact of Events Scale â€“ Revised and trajectories determined by categorising scores at each survey according to a threshold prescribed for identifying symptoms warranting clinical concern. Responses were analysed with univariate and multivariate multinomial regressions. Socioeconomic advantage and social support were associated with the resilient trajectory, which was the most common posttraumatic distress trajectory among participants. Prior trauma and recent stressful life-events, physical and mental health diagnoses, and loneliness were associated with chronic and delayed-onset trajectories. PM2.5 exposure during the mine fire was not a strong determinant of posttraumatic distress trajectory. Socioeconomic status, social connection, health and life experiences are among the most important factors shaping posttraumatic distress trajectories. These findings contribute to better understanding longer-term psychological resilience and vulnerability following disasters and can inform mental health initiatives within at-risk communities.","Catherine L Smith et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0032-0C1-308","20220817","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; posttraumatic distress trajectories; posttraumatic distress risk factors; disaster; multinomial logistic regression modelling; pm2.5 exposure; mine fire","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-08-17","",36176,""
