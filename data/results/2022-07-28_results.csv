"Large-scale web scraping for problem gambling research: a case study of COVID-19 lockdown effects in Germany","The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to prevent its spread have had a negative impact on substance use behaviour and posed a special threat for individuals at risk. Problem gambling is a major public health concern, and it is likely that the lockdown and social distancing measures have altered gambling behaviour, for instance shifting from land-based to online gambling. In this study, we used large-scale web scraping to analyse posting behaviour on a major German online gambling forum, gathering a database of more than 200k posts. We examined the relative usage of different subforums, i.e. terrestrial, online gambling and problem gambling sections, posting frequency, and changes in posting behaviour related to the casino closures that were part of the nationwide restrictions in Germany in 2020. There was a marked increase in the number of newly registered users during the first lockdown compared to the weeks prior to the lockdown, which may reflect a shift from terrestrial to online gambling. Further, there was an increase in the number of posts in the online gambling subforum with a concurrent decrease in the number of posts in the terrestrial gambling subforum. An analysis of user types revealed that a substantial number of users who posted in both the online and terrestrial forum contributed at least once to the problem gambling subforum. This subforum contained the longest posts, which were on average twice as long as the average post. Modelling the relationship between reply frequency and latency between initial posts and replies showed that the number of short-latency replies (i.e. replies posted within seven hours after the initial post) was substantially higher during the first lockdown compared to the preceeding weeks.The increase during the first lockdown may reflect the general marked increase in screen time and/or usage of online platforms and media after the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The analyses may help to identify lockdown-related effects on gambling behaviour. These potentially detrimental effects on mental health, including addiction and problem gambling, may require monitoring and special public health measures.","Elke Smith; Simon Michalski; Kilian H.

"#LongCOVID affects children too: A Twitter analysis of healthcare workers sentiment and discourse about Long COVID in children and young people in the UK","AimsWith a social media analysis of the discourse surrounding the prevalence of Long COVID in children and young people (CYP), this study aims to explore healthcare workers perceptions concerning Long COVID in CYP in the UK between January 2021 and January 2022. This will allow to contribute to the emerging knowledge on Long COVID and identify critical areas and future directions for researchers and policymakers.

DesignA mixed methods approach with a discourse, keywords, sentiment, and image analysis, using Pulsar and Infranodus.

SettingA discussion of the experience of Long COVID in CYP in the UK shared on Twitter between 1 January 2021 and 31 January 2022.

ParticipantsA sample of health workers with Twitter accounts whose bio has them identifying themselves as HCWs.

ResultsWe obtained 2588 tweets. HCW were responsive to announcements issued by authorities regarding the management of COVID-19 in the UK. The most frequent feelings were negative. The main themes were uncertainty about the future, policies and regulations, managing and addressing COVID-19 and Long COVID in CYP, vaccination, using Twitter to share scientific literature and management strategies, and clinical and personal experiences.

ConclusionsThe perceptions described on Twitter by HCW concerning the presence of Long COVID in CYP appear to be a relevant and timely issue and responsive to the declarations and guidelines issued by health authorities over time. We recommend further support and training strategies for health workers and school staff regarding the manifestations and treatment of Long COVID in CYP.

Strengths and limitations of this study- Our online analysis of Long COVID contributes towards an emerging understanding of reported experiential, emotional and practical dimensions of Long COVID in CYP specifically, as well as questions of vaccine hesitancy in CYP with Long COVID.
- We identify key policy areas that need considered attention and focus, such as: a) the provision of psychosocial support with access to quality mental health resources to alleviate the impact that Long COVID can have on the mental health of CYP; and b) the development of clear Long COVID pandemic recovery policies that are informed from a health equity perspective and how this affects CYP living with Long COVID.
- This is one of few studies to collect healthcare workers perceptions regarding Long COVID in CYP in the UK, using information from Twitter.
- This study is limited to the perception of those who identified as healthcare workers via their online biographies, and so is not representative of the general UK or the global population.","Sam Martin; Macarena Chepo; Noemie Deom; Ahmad Firas Khalid; Cecilia Vindrola-Padros","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.07.20.22277865","20220725","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35158,""
"Emotional awareness and expression therapy and mindfulness meditation training for college students with anxiety and somatic symptoms: A randomized controlled trial","This trial evaluated the efficacy of two conceptually different, three-session interventions for university students with at least moderate symptoms of anxiety and somatic symptoms such as headaches, back pain, or digestive system difficulties. Eligible students (N = 52) were randomly assigned to receive a mindfulness-based intervention (MMT) (n = 19), an emotional awareness and expression intervention (EAET) (n = 15), or to a waitlist control condition (WLC) (n = 18). Assessments of physical, social, and psychological functioning were conducted immediately before randomization, again 4 weeks later, and finally 8 weeks after randomization. Participants in the control condition were invited to receive the intervention of their choice after completing the final assessment. Despite the fact that the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted this trial when it was just over half completed, and the resulting sample size lacks statistical power to detect small effects, the results are noteworthy and often statistically significant.The MMT intervention was highly effective in improving a wide range of outcomes in this population. This intervention led to significantly greater improvements than did the control condition on both primary outcomes, somatic symptoms and anxiety, as well as on all secondary outcomes (depression, interpersonal sensitivity, perceived stress, positive and negative affect, and life satisfaction), and with large effect sizes. The effects of the EAET intervention were somewhat modest and not consistent across measures. The intervention was significantly superior to the control condition in improving depression and positive affect, as well as anxiety and negative affect, and interpersonal sensitivity, with moderate to large effect sizes. However, EAET did not improve the primary outcome of somatic symptoms (only small effects), nor did EAET improve perceived stress or life satisfaction, compared to the control condition. Although it was expected that both active treatments would lead to comparable improvements in clinical outcomes, impressively, MMT led to significantly greater improvements than did EAET on somatic symptoms, interpersonal sensitivity, and life satisfaction, with large effect sizes. These results suggest that each of these interventions are appropriate for anxious college students, but that the MMT intervention may be more broadly effective.Changes in proposed process measures were not found to be specific to treatment condition. It was hypothesized that the MMT intervention would lead to decreases in experiential avoidance and increases in mindfulness, and that the EAET intervention would lead to increases in emotional expressivity and emotional approach coping. Although the MMT intervention was effective in decreasing experiential avoidance and in increasing mindfulness, as hypothesized, it also resulted in increases in emotional approach coping and in emotional expressivity. The EAET intervention was effective in increasing emotional expressivity and emotional approach coping, but EAET also led to reductions in experiential avoidance and increases in mindfulness. When compared to each other, the two interventions had similar effects on all four process measures.These results suggest that, although very different from one another, these two interventions may share some common pathways. For example, both interventions support increasing emotional awareness and decreasing avoidance of uncomfortable emotions, which might provide one explanation for the observed effects of both interventions on experiential avoidance and mindfulness. It is also the case that when novel interventions are developed, it is not uncommon for researchers to use different jargon to refer to processes of interest that are addressed by other older therapies.

"Designing of Latent Dirichlet Allocation Based Prediction Model to Detect Midlife Crisis of Losing Jobs due to Prolonged Lockdown for COVID-19","The sudden outbreak of the virus COVID-19 has created a pandemic situation worldwide. Humankind has not experienced such a danger caused by this disease in the past hundred years. Apart from all the health issues, the pandemic has created an immense impact on social life, economics, mental peace, and all aspects of human life. Prolonged quarantine is creating uncertainties;death tolls are creating fear. According to the World Health Organization, this public health emergency is likely to create anxiety, loneliness, depression, fear of losing jobs, being economically unstable, and committing suicide. In our present discussion, we prepare a statistical record using data collected from all over the world to find the intensity of mental disorder caused by this pandemic. Now we aim at finding the polarity of the specified term used by social media users. We aim to formulate a highly efficient mechanism that will detect depressive sentences more accurately. In our work, we try to formulate an optimal mechanism implementing the Latent Dirichlet Allocation approach to modify our findings and prove through a comparative study that depression affects the highest among people age 40-50. We experience that this age group is highly devastated in fear of losing jobs because of to this pandemic. The standard psychiatric symptom of lack of self-dignity and self-confidence that can happen to a human at the middle age is proliferated due to extended lockdown and its after effects. There is much research in sentiment analysis, which shows us the impact of COVID-19 in recent days. Surprisingly, recognizing symptoms of the midlife crisis in the pandemic situation of COVID-19 is yet to achieve.","Das, Basabdatta, Das, Barshan, Chatterjee, Avik, Das, Abhijit","https://www.google.com/search?q=Designing+of+Latent+Dirichlet+Allocation+Based+Prediction+Model+to+Detect+Midlife+Crisis+of+Losing+Jobs+due+to+Prolonged+Lockdown+for+COVID-19","","Database: EuropePMC; Publication type: article; Publication details: Cyber-Physical Systems;: 219-230, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35160,""

"Take a breath: A population-oriented prevention approach using mindfulness training to impact college students' sense of coherence, stress levels, and help-seeking intentions","Mental health concerns and resource utilization has greatly increased on college campuses in recent years (ACHA - NCHA, 2017, AUCCCD, 2012, Bourdon et al., 2018). Campus counseling centers are concerned about their ability to meet the sheer volume of students with severe mental health concerns though (AUCCCD, 2012). Drum and colleagues (2009) proposed that college campuses should expand their interventions to address the mental health needs for students across the distress continuum. Sense of coherence (SOC), theorized by Aaron Antonovsky (1987), is a protective factor in which students will be better equiped to handle a variety of life stressors through internal and external coping strategies. Previous research suggests that mindfulness training can increase SOC levels in diverse populations (Karlsson et al., 2000, Volanen et al., 2004). The ""Take a Breath"" study assessed if the online mindfulness intervention, ""Headspace,"" can impact college students' SOC levels, perceived stress, mindfulness skills, and help-seeking intentions. Results indicate that the mindfulness skills and SOC levels influence perceived stress and help-seeking intentions. However, the ""Headspace"" intervention did not significantly impact the dependent variables in comparison to the control group. The COVID-19 pandemic occurred during data collectino and emphasized the importance of protective factors and mentalh health resource accessibility. Although the results did not indicate ""Headspace"" to have a significant influence on the variables of interest, college campuses should continue to research accessible mental health resources for students at all levels of distress in light of the recent pandemic.

"A phenomenological study of the lived experiences of parents choosing remote learning for their high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on the educational system at the end of the 2019-20 school year and into the 2020-21 school year. Lockdowns of schools meant a shift to emergency remote learning. So as the 2020-21 school year began, parents had to make choices about the best educational experience for their student(s). Parents in the research study's district had the option of continuing with remote learning or sending students back into the physical classroom. This phenomenological study investigated the lived experiences of parents with multiple students at the high school level choosing the remote learning option. The findings show the struggles and the successes of the parents that had children learning in a virtual setting. The recommendations for educational leaders and parents include removing remote learning barriers, monitoring student mental health concerns, and using remote learning to create flexibility for future student learners.

"Rapid Onset Functional Tic-Like Disorder Outbreak: A Challenging Differential Diagnosis in the COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries have observed an unexpected increase in the number of adolescents and young adults presenting with rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours after being exposed to social media content of others displaying a similar pattern of functional tics. Many of these patients have been referred to Movement Disorders Clinics with misdiagnoses of late-onset refractory Tourette Syndrome after failing different pharmacological treatments for tics. Tourette Syndrome is a well-known condition with clear clinical diagnostic criteria and which presents with the insidious onset of simple motor and phonic tics in a rostro-caudal evolution starting in early childhood. Clinical and demographic aspects can differentiate rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours from Tourette Syndrome, including the former having abrupt and explosive presentation of severe symptoms, later age of onset, female gender predominance, lack of suppressibility, comorbid anxiety and depression, atypical premonitory urge and history of exposure to social media content displaying tic-like behaviours. This new presentation of a functional neurological disorder may be explained in part by the relationship between social media exposure to tic-like behaviours, and maladaptive response to anxiety caused by life stressors (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic), especially in young individuals. Rapid onset functional tic-like behaviours may be considered a spreading neuropsychiatric disorder that is potentially fostered by the psychosocial impact caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Durant la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19, plusieurs pays ont observÃ© une hausse inattendue du nombre d'adolescents et de jeunes adultes prÃ©sentant des comportements fonctionnels de type tic Ã  apparition rapide aprÃ¨s avoir Ã©tÃ© exposÃ©s au contenu des mÃ©dias sociaux d'autres personnes affichant un modÃ¨le semblable de tics fonctionnels. Nombre de ces patients ont Ã©tÃ© adressÃ©s Ã  des cliniques de trouble du mouvement avec des diagnostics fautifs de syndrome de Tourette rÃ©fractaire d'apparition tardive aprÃ¨s avoir Ã©chouÃ© Ã  diffÃ©rents traitements pharmacologiques pour les tics. Le syndrome de Tourette est un trouble bin connu dont les critÃ¨res diagnostiques cliniques sont clairs et qui prÃ©sente le dÃ©but insidieux de simples tics moteurs et phoniques dans une Ã©volution rostro-caudale au dÃ©but de l'enfance. Les aspects cliniques et dÃ©mographiques peuvent diffÃ©rencier l'apparition rapide de comportements fonctionnels de type tic du syndrome de Tourette, notamment parce que les premiers ont une prÃ©sentation abrupte et explosive de symptÃ´mes graves, apparaissent Ã  un Ã¢ge plus avancÃ©, ont une prÃ©dominance chez le sexe fÃ©minin, manquent de suppressibilitÃ©, anxiÃ©tÃ© et dÃ©pression comorbides, envie prÃ©monitoire atypique et antÃ©cÃ©dents d'exposition au contenu des mÃ©dias sociaux affichant des comportements de type tic. Cette nouvelle prÃ©sentation d'un trouble neurologique fonctionnel peut s'expliquer en partie par la relation entre l'exposition aux comportements de type tic dans les mÃ©dias sociaux et la rÃ©ponse inadaptÃ©e Ã  l'anxiÃ©tÃ© causÃ©e par les stresseurs de la vie (p. ex., pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19), surtout chez les jeunes personnes. Les comportements fonctionnels de type tic Ã  apparition rapide peuvent Ãªtre considÃ©rÃ©s comme un trouble neuropsychiatrique qui se propage et qui est potentiellement favorisÃ© par l'effet psychosocial causÃ© par la pandÃ©mie de la COVID-19.","Amorelli, Gabriel, Martino, Davide, Pringsheim, Tamara","https://www.google.com/search?q=Rapid+Onset+Functional+Tic-Like+Disorder+Outbreak:+A+Challenging+Differential+Diagnosis+in+the+COVID-19+Pandemic","","Database: CINAHL; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of the Canadian Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry; 31(3):144-181, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35165,""

In this study, we identified an atypical monocyte subpopulation expressing CD56 molecules that showed a low level of HLA-DR and high level of L-selectin. They released higher amounts of TNF-ÃŽÂ± and IL-6 and expressed genes associated with an excessive inflammatory process. Remarkably, the frequency of CD56<sup>+</sup> monocytes inversely correlated with that of CD16<sup>+</sup> monocytes and a high CD56<sup>+</sup>/CD16<sup>+</sup>monocyte ratio was associated with both disease severity and mortality, as well as with serum concentration of type I IFN, a factor able to induce the appearance of CD56<sup>+</sup> monocytes. In conclusion, severe COVID-19 is characterized by the abundance of hyperinflammatory CD56<sup>+</sup> monocytes, which could represent a novel marker with prognostic significance and, possibly, a therapeutic target for controlling the inflammatory process occurring during COVID-19.","Campana, De Pasquale, Sidoti Migliore, Pezzino, Cavaliere, Venanzi Rullo, Nunnari, Caramori, David, Bonaccorsi, Pollicino, Carrega, Ferlazzo","https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2200021","20220727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35167,""
"Gendered impact of COVID-19 containment measures on unpaid care work and mental health in Europe: a scoping review protocol","Women are more likely than men to provide unpaid care work. Previous research has shown that lack of support for various forms of unpaid care work and work-family conflicts have negative impacts on caregivers' mental health, especially among female caregivers. COVID-19 containment measures may exacerbate existing gender inequalities both in terms of unpaid care work and adverse mental health outcomes. This scoping review protocol describes the systematic approach to review published literature from March 2020 onwards to identify empirical studies and grey literature on the mental health impact of COVID-19 containment measures on subgroups of unpaid caregivers at the intersection of gender and other categories of social difference (eg, ethnicity, age, class) in Europe. This scoping review is informed and guided by Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. We will search the databases Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, CINAHL, Social Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts as well as Applied Social Sciences Index &amp; Abstracts (ASSIA) and hand-search reference lists of selected articles to identify relevant peer-reviewed studies. We will conduct a grey literature search using Google Scholar and targeted hand-search on known international and European websites and include reports, working papers, policy briefs and book chapters that meet the inclusion criteria. Studies that report gender-segregated findings for mental health outcomes associated with unpaid care work in the context of COVID-19 containment measures in Europe will be included. Two reviewers will independently screen all abstracts and full texts for inclusion, and extract general information, study characteristics and relevant findings. Results will be synthesized narratively. This study is a review of published literature; ethics approval is not warranted. The findings of this study will inform public health research and policy.

With a mean of 6.56 (SD: 1.58; 95% CI: 6.45 to 6.67) months after hospital discharge, 70.86% (567 of 800) reported limited daily activities, which were severe in 5.62% (45 of 800). They also reported pain and discomfort (64.50%, 516 of 800), breathlessness (64.66%, 514 of 795), and anxiety and depression (57.27%, 457 of 798). Daytime sleepiness and insomnia evaluations showed subthreshold results. Most (92.85%, 727 of 783) participants reported unrestricted oral intake. Data indicated no generalised fatigue (mean score: 39.18, SD: 9.77; 95% CI: 38.50 to 39.86). Assessments showed poor handgrip strength (52.20%, 379 of 726) and abnormal Timed Up and Go results (mean 13.07Ã¢â‚¬â€°s, SD: 6.49). The invasive mechanical ventilation group seemed to have a better handgrip strength however. We found no clear trends of change in their functional status during months passed since hospital discharge. Muscle weakness, pain, anxiety, depression, breathlessness, reduced mobility, insomnia and daytime sleepiness were the most prevalent long-term conditions identified among previously hospitalised COVID-19 survivors.","Battistella, Imamura, De Pretto, Van Cauwenbergh, Delgado Ramos, Saemy Tome Uchiyama, Matheus, Kuhn, Amaral de Oliveira, Souza Naves, Rossetti Mirisola, de Quadros Ribeiro, Tadeu Sugawara, Cantarino, Andrade Santos Antunes Cavalca, Pagano, Valentim Marques, Mendes da Silva, Pereira Gomes, Fregni","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057246","20220727","COVID-19; PUBLIC HEALTH; REHABILITATION MEDICINE","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35169,""
"Are hemoglobin-derived peptides involved in the neuropsychiatric symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection?","Follow-up of patients affected by COVID-19 has unveiled remarkable findings. Among the several sequelae caused by SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, it is particularly noteworthy that patients are prone to developing depression, anxiety, cognitive disorders, and dementia as part of the post-COVID-19 syndrome. The multisystem aspects of this disease suggest that multiple mechanisms may converge towards post-infection clinical manifestations. The literature provides mechanistic hypotheses related to changes in classical neurotransmission evoked by SARS-CoV-2 infection; nonetheless, the interaction of peripherally originated classical and non-canonic peptidergic systems may play a putative role in this neuropathology. A wealth of robust findings shows that hemoglobin-derived peptides are able to control cognition, memory, anxiety, and depression through different mechanisms. Early erythrocytic death is found during COVID-19, which would cause excess production of hemoglobin-derived peptides. Following from this premise, the present review sheds light on a possible involvement of hemoglobin-derived molecules in the COVID-19 pathophysiology by fostering neuroscientific evidence that supports the contribution of this non-canonic peptidergic pathway. This rationale may broaden knowledge beyond the currently available data, motivating further studies in the field and paving ways for novel laboratory tests and clinical approaches.","MendonÃƒÂ§a, da Cruz, Dos Santos Silva, Fontes, Xavier","https://doi.org/10.47626/1516-4446-2021-2339","20220727","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; hemoglobin; hemopressins; hemorphins; neurology; neurotransmitters; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35170,""
"Health status, coronaphobia, quality of life, anxiety and depression in patients with lymphedema during COVID-19 pandemic","Covid-19 has physical damage as well as serious impact on the mental health in the community. Symptoms such as anxiety, depression, fear, stress, and sleep problems were more commonly reported during Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to assess the health status, psychological conditions, quality of life, and possible risk factors of patients with lymphedema during the pandemic. The study included male and female patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years with primary or secondary upper or lower extremity lymphedema (stage 1, 2, or 3) who were followed in our outpatient clinic. The patients were interviewed by phone. Health and social status were examined using a questionnaire, Covid-19 phobia was assessed using Covid-19 Phobia Scale (C19P-S), and quality of life was assessed using Lymphedema Quality of Life Questionnaire Arm or Leg (LYMQOL). Anxiety and depression were evaluated using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS scores showed that 35% of the patients had severe risk for depression and 10% had severe risk for anxiety. Factors with negative effect on HADS were lower education level, sedentary lifestyle, failure to perform lymphedema exercises, weight gain, and lymphedema duration. The C19P-S scores were higher indicating greater phobia in the overall score and subscores in patients with primary lymphedema and secondary lymphedema without malignancy, younger patients, those who are not able to walk regularly, and those who are not able to perform self manual lymphatic drainage (self-MLD). Factors with negative effects on LYMQOL were stage 3 lymphedema, female gender, younger age, and longer disease duration. Patients who performed regular self-MLD and lymphedema exercises demonstrated positive effects on LYMQOL. The results of this study suggest that patients with lymphedema affected by the COVID-19 pandemic are mostly younger patients, individuals with primary lymphedema, individuals with non-malignant etiology, individuals who unable to perform regular walking, and those unable to perform self- MLD.","Begoglu, Akpinar, Ozkan, Ozturk, Aktas","https://www.google.com/search?q=Health+status,+coronaphobia,+quality+of+life,+anxiety+and+depression+in+patients+with+lymphedema+during+COVID-19+pandemic.","20220727","Covid-19; anxiety; depression; lymphedema; phobia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35171,""
"Effect of neurofeedback therapy on neurological post-COVID-19 complications (A pilot study)","Anxiety, fatigue and depression are common neurological manifestations after COVID-19. So far, post-COVID complications were treated by rehabilitation, oxygen therapy and immunotherapy. Effects of neurofeedback on post-COVID complications and their potential interrelatedness have not been studied yet. In this pilot study, we investigated the effectiveness of neurofeedback (Othmer method) for treatment of fatigue, anxiety, and depression after COVID-19. 10 participants met inclusion criteria for having positive anamnesis of at least one of the following complications following COVID-19: fatigue, anxiety, and depression which were measured by questionnaires. ANOVA was used for calculating differences in questionnaire score before and after neurofeedback. Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to calculate correlations between anxiety, depression and fatigue. After five neurofeedback sessions, there came to significant reduction of severity of post-COVID anxiety and depression persisting for at least one month. Effect of neurofeedback on fatigue was insignificant. Severity of anxiety, fatigue and depression as well as reductions in depression and fatigue were positively correlated with each other. These findings showed effectiveness neurofeedback for reducing anxiety and depression after COVID-19 and for studying correlations between neurological complications after COVID-19. However, since our pilot clinical trial was open-label, it is hard to differentiate between neurofeedback-specific and unspecific effects on our participants. Future randomized controlled trials with more robust sample are necessary to investigate feasibility of neurofeedback for post-COVID neurological complications.

"Fear and death anxiety in the shadow of COVID-19 among the Lebanese population: A cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most devastating health crises the world has seen. One of its mental health consequences includes fear of being infected, which could lead to anxiety. This study aimed to assess the fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated factors among the adult population in Lebanon. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Lebanon between February 26th and April 29th, 2021. Data was collected through an online survey among adults aged 18 years and older. Information on sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the participants, fear and death anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic, depression, and anxiety were collected. Multivariable linear regression analyses were carried out to identify the predictors of fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1840 participants were included in the analysis of which 62.9% were females and 62.2% were single. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 70 years with a mean of 26.6 Ã‚Â±8.8 years. Of the total participants, 41.9% felt uncomfortable thinking about the novel Coronavirus and 35.4% of candidates became nervous/anxious when watching the news about COVID-19 on social media. About one-third of the participants (33.7%) were afraid of COVID-19 and 23.8% were afraid of losing their life because of the disease. Concerning somatic symptoms of fear, 7.9% reported increased heart races or palpitations whenever they thought about getting infected with COVID-19, 3.7% complained about sleep disturbances while 2.5% developed tremors or sweating in their hands when they thought about Coronavirus. In addition, Death anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic was one of the most fear-related factors (B = 0.191, 95% CI (0.172 to 0.211), P-value &lt; 0.0001). This study provides insights on the impact of COVID-19 on individuals at the level of fear in Lebanon. Death anxiety was identified as the most significant predictor of fear related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative psychological effects of fear, it is necessary to educate the adults on how to deal with death anxiety and implement psychological interventions and counseling programs to relieve fear and improve the mental health of Lebanese adults.","Chalhoub, Koubeissy, Fares, Abou-Abbas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0270567","20220727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35173,""
"Applying ICD-11 criteria of Gaming Disorder to identify problematic video streaming in adolescents: Conceptualization of a new clinical phenomenon","Internet video streaming (VS) has become a popular leisure activity among the majority of adolescents, especially under the COVID-19 pandemic. Research on binge watching patterns in adults suggests an addictive potential of VS. To date, no unified conceptualization on problematic VS and no standardized assessment tools for adolescents exist even though they might be especially vulnerable. STREDIS-A is based on the ICD-11 criteria of gaming disorder. It was validated in a representative sample of 959 dyads of 10- to 17-year old adolescents with frequent VS and a respective parent using standardized questionnaires on Internet addiction, depressive and anxiety symptoms, insomnia, loneliness, and academic performance in an online survey. Item structure was investigated by factorial analyses. Cutoffs were estimated and latent profile analysis was performed. The two-factorial structure of STREDIS-A describes cognitive-behavioral symptoms and negative consequences of VS. Internal consistency and criterion validity were good to excellent. It could excellently discriminate between affected and non-affected adolescents. The present study makes a significant contribution to the conceptualization of a new phenomenon. It provides the very first tool to assess streaming disorder in adolescents for clinical and research settings. Clinical validation is highly warranted.","Paschke, Napp, Thomasius","https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2022.00041","20220727","ICD-11; adolescents; binge watching; problematic streaming; streaming disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35174,""
"Depression Among Portuguese Pregnant Women During Covid-19 Lockdown: A Cross Sectional Study","Coronavirus disease 2019 was declared as a pandemic on March 2020. Research on its psychological effects is still lacking. Perinatal depression is a medical complication of pregnancy, especially in situations of stress. In this study, we aimed to investigate the presence of symptoms of depression in pregnant women during the lockdown period in Portugal. This study consisted in a cross-sectional study among Portuguese pregnant women, who completed an online self-report questionnaire between 25th April and 30th April 2020. An anonymous online questionnaire was developed to assess depression and concerns related to COVID-19. This study was approved by the IRB of Hospital Dona EstefÃƒÂ¢nia and performed in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki. Eligibility criteria included pregnant women, Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years and living in Portugal. The primary outcome was to evaluate the presence of depressive symptoms and its association to socio-demographic characteristics and to concerns related to COVID-19. A total of 1698 pregnant women were enrolled. The mean age was 31.9Ã‚Â years. 82.4% felt a negative impact of the pandemic in the surveillance of pregnancy and 43% felt insufficient support. 26.3% showed ""possible depression"" according to the EPDS. A regression analysis revealed the possibility of depression increased as the concerns about COVID increased and was lower for women with support. The possibility of depression was higher for women with psychiatric medical history. This study demonstrated a significant increase in clinically significant depressive symptoms in pregnant women during the lockdown. It also revealed some of the socio-demographic characteristics of women at risk for depression. If left untreated, depression tends to persist, affecting the woman and also the child. Our findings suggest that COVID-19 represents a serious challenge for this population and reinforce the urgent need for early detection and intervention on mental health issues during pregnancy, especially during the pandemic.","Padez Vieira, Mesquita Reis, Figueiredo, Lopes, Nascimento, Marques, Caldeira da Silva","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10995-022-03466-7","20220727","COVID-19; Lockdown; Pregnancy, depression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35175,""
"Association of Shelter-in-Place Hotels With Health Services Use Among People Experiencing Homelessness During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Some jurisdictions used hotels to provide emergency noncongregate shelter and support services to reduce the risk of COVID-19 infection among people experiencing homelessness (PEH). A subset of these shelter-in-place (SIP) hotel guests were high users of acute health services, and the association of hotel placement with their service use remains unknown. To evaluate the association of SIP hotel placements with health services use among a subset of PEH with prior high acute health service use. This study used a matched retrospective cohort design comparing health services use between PEH with prior high service use who did and did not receive a SIP hotel placement, from April 2020 to April 2021. The setting was 25 SIP hotels in San Francisco, California, with a daily capacity of 2500 people. Participants included PEH who were among the top 10% high users of acute medical, mental health, and substance use services and who had 3 or more emergency department (ED) visits in the 9 months before the implementation of the SIP hotel program. Data analysis for this study was performed from February 2021 to May 2022. SIP hotel placement with on-site supportive services. The primary outcomes were ED visits, hospitalizations and bed days, psychiatric emergency visits, psychiatric hospitalizations, outpatient mental health and substance use visits, and outpatient medical visits. Of 2524 SIP guests with a minimum of 90-day stays, 343 (13.6%) met criteria for high service use. Of 686 participants with high service use (343 SIP group; 343 control), the median (IQR) age was 54 (43-61) years, 485 (70.7%) were male, 283 (41.3%) were Black, and 337 (49.1%) were homeless for more than 10 years. The mean number of ED visits decreased significantly in the high-user SIP group (1.84 visits [95% CI, 1.52-2.17 visits] in the 90 days before SIP placement to 0.82 visits [95% CI, 0.66-0.99 visits] in the 90 days after SIP placement) compared with high-user controls (decrease from 1.33 visits [95% CI, 1.39-1.58 visits] to 1.00 visits [95% CI, 0.80-1.20 visits]) (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.47-0.75; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). The mean number of hospitalizations decreased significantly from 0.41 (95% CI, 0.30-0.51) to 0.14 (95% CI, 0.09-0.19) for SIP guests vs 0.27 (95% CI, 0.19-0.34) to 0.22 (95% CI, 0.15-0.29) for controls (IRR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-063; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001).

"Association of Everyday Discrimination With Depressive Symptoms and Suicidal Ideation During the COVID-19 Pandemic in the All of Us Research Program","The COVID-19 pandemic has coincided with an increase in depressive symptoms as well as a growing awareness of health inequities and structural racism in the United States. To examine the association of mental health with everyday discrimination during the pandemic in a large and diverse cohort of the All of Us Research Program. Using repeated assessments in the early months of the pandemic, mixed-effects models were fitted to assess the associations of discrimination with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, and inverse probability weights were applied to account for nonrandom probabilities of completing the voluntary survey. The exposure and outcome measures were ascertained using the Everyday Discrimination Scale and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), respectively. Scores for PHQ-9 that were greater than or equal to 10 were classified as moderate to severe depressive symptoms, and any positive response to the ninth item of the PHQ-9 scale was considered as presenting suicidal ideation. A total of 62Ã¢â‚¬Â¯651 individuals (mean [SD] age, 59.3 [15.9] years; female sex at birth, 41Ã¢â‚¬Â¯084 [65.6%]) completed at least 1 assessment between May and July 2020. An association with significantly increased likelihood of moderate to severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation was observed as the levels of discrimination increased. There was a dose-response association, with 17.68-fold (95% CI, 13.49-23.17; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and 10.76-fold (95% CI, 7.82-14.80; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) increases in the odds of moderate to severe depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, respectively, on experiencing discrimination more than once a week. In addition, the association with depressive symptoms was greater when the main reason for discrimination was race, ancestry, or national origins among Hispanic or Latino participants at all 3 time points and among non-Hispanic Asian participants in May and June 2020. Furthermore, high levels of discrimination were as strongly associated with moderate to severe depressive symptoms as was history of prepandemic mood disorder diagnosis. In this large and diverse sample, increased levels of discrimination were associated with higher odds of experiencing moderate to severe depressive symptoms. This association was particularly evident when the main reason for discrimination was race, ancestry, or national origins among Hispanic or Latino participants and, early in the pandemic, among non-Hispanic Asian participants.","Lee, Liu, Fatori, Bauermeister, Luh, Clark, Bauermeister, Brunoni, Smoller","https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.1973","20220727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35177,""

"Do the Self-Reported Changes in Physical Activity After the Emergence of the COVID-19 Pandemic Associate With Major Depression According to Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity Status?","As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged, and social distancing increased, the physical activity (PA) of people decreased, which increased depression. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between self-reported changes in PA with the COVID-19 pandemic and major depression according to moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) status. This study included 228,457 adults and used data from the Korea Community Health Survey 2020. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between self-reported changes in PA and major depression stratified by MVPA status. The percentage of participants who reported decreases in PA was 39.5% in men and 44.7% in women compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. Those who reported decreases in PA after the onset of COVID-19 had major depression (men odds ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.43 and women odds ratio = 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.46). Women who were moderately or vigorously physically active had higher odds of major depression when they reported decreases in PA (odds ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.62). People who reported decreases in PA were associated with major depression compared with the pre-COVID-19 pandemic period. Based on this, the government should encourage exercise to reduce major depression and provide guidelines for PA at home or outdoors.","Ahn, Nam","https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2022-0049","20220727","mental health; pandemic; physical activity; sex differences","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35179,""
"Importance of Analyzing Intervals to Emergency Medical Service Treatments","BackgroundAlthough most US emergency medical services (EMS) systems collect time-to-treatment data in their electronic prehospital patient care reports (PCRs), analysis of these data seldom appears in publications. We believe EMS agencies should routinely analyze at least the initial time-to-treatment data for various potentially life-threatening conditions on quality review. This step not only assures that protocol-required treatments have been provided but can discover avoidable delays and, when necessary, drive protocol and treatment priority change.The purpose of this study was to analyze the interval from 9-1-1 call receipt until the first administration of naloxone to adult opioid overdose victims to demonstrate the quality assurance importance of analyzing time-to-treatment data.MethodRetrospective analysis of times from 9-1-1 call receipt to initial naloxone treatment in adult opioid overdose victims treated by EMS personnel in Richmond, VA, between 1/1/19 and 10/24/21. The analysis excluded victims &lt;18 years of age and cases where a bystander, police, or a health care worker gave naloxone before EMS arrival. We compared data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic to determine any effect it may have had on the analysis.ResultsA total of 582 opioid overdose cases were analyzed. The mean patient age was 40.7 years [95% CI 39.6, 41.8], and 405 were males (69.6%). EMS units arrived at the scene in 6.7Ã¢â‚¬â€°minutes from the 9-1-1 call receipt. It took 1.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°minutes to reach the victim, and 8.6 additional minutes to administer the first naloxone regardless of administration route (70.4% intravenous, 26.1% intranasal, 2.7% intraosseous, 0.7% intramuscular). EMS personnel administered the first naloxone 17.1Ã¢â‚¬â€°minutes after the 9-1-1 call receipt, with 50.3% of the delay occurring after EMS contacted the patient. There was no statistically significant difference in the times-to-treatment before vs. during the pandemic.ConclusionThe interval from 9-1-1 call receipt until initial EMS administration of naloxone was substantial during our analysis period and did not change significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our findings provide an important example that supports why EMS agencies should analyze initial time-to-treatment data, especially for life-threatening conditions, beyond assuring that protocol-required treatments have been provided. Based on our analysis, fire department crews now carry intranasal naloxone, and intranasal naloxone is given to ""impaired"" opioid overdose victims by either fire department or EMS personnel, whoever arrives first. We are continuing to collect data on intervals-to-treatment prospectively and monitoring our critical process and treatment intervals. We are using the plan-do-study-act model for improving our process and carrying out a change. We plan to share our results in a future publication once we have sufficient data.","Ornato, Dunbar, Harbour, Ludin, Peberdy","https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2022.2107124","20220727","Quality assurance; opioid use disorder; out-of-hospital; time; treatment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35180,""
"Stress, Insomnia, and Leisure in Dementia Family Caregivers Correlates with Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic added a new stress source for caregivers. Many aspects influence the potential depressive or anxiety symptomatology in caregivers. This study explored the association among COVID-19 related stressors, insomnia, leisure, and caregivers' depression and anxiety. 101 family caregivers of people with dementia were asked about COVID-19 related stressors, insomnia, leisure, depression and anxiety symptoms. Four regression models with caregivers' depression and anxiety symptoms as dependent variables were tested. Four potential mediation models were investigated. Two of them had insomnia as the independent variable and leisure as a mediator, and the other two had leisure as the independent variable and insomnia as a mediator. Regression models accounted for 48% and 40.6% of the variance in depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The four mediator models were statistically significant. Findings suggest two potential mechanisms affecting caregivers' distress during the pandemic. Insomnia and leisure significantly contributed to explain caregivers' anxiety and depressive symptoms, even after controlling for COVID-19 related stressors. Provision of resources to increase the chances of caregivers engaging in leisure activities, alongside a reduction of barriers potentially limiting good sleep, may contribute significantly to improving the depression and anxiety symptoms of family caregivers.","JimÃƒÂ©nez-Gonzalo, Vara-GarcÃƒÂ­a, Romero-Moreno, MÃƒÂ¡rquez-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Barrera-Caballero, OlazarÃƒÂ¡n, Losada-Baltar","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2022.2102955","20220727","COVID-19; Sleep problems; anxiety; dementia caregiving; depression; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35181,""
"COVID-19 and olfactory dysfunction: a looming wave of dementia?","Olfactory dysfunction is a hallmark symptom of COVID-19 disease resulting from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The cause of the sudden and usually temporary anosmia that most people suffer from COVID-19 is likely entirely peripheral - inflammation and other damage caused by the virus in the sensory epithelium inside the upper recesses of the nasal cavity can damage or prevent chemicals from properly activating the olfactory sensory neurons. However, persistent olfactory dysfunction from COVID-19, in the form of hyposmia and parosmia (decreased or altered smell) may affect as many as 15 million people worldwide. This epidemic of olfactory dysfunction is thus a continuing public health concern. Mounting evidence suggests that the SARS-CoV-2 virus itself or inflammation from the immune response in the nasal sensory epithelium may invade the olfactory bulb, likely via non-neuronal transmission. COVID-19 related long term olfactory dysfunction and early damage to olfactory and limbic brain regions suggests a pattern of degeneration similar to that seen in early stages of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lewy Body dementias. Thus, long term olfactory dysfunction coupled with cognitive and emotional disturbance from COVID-19 may be the first signs of delayed onset dementia from neurodegeneration. Few treatments are known to be effective to prevent further degeneration, but the first line of defense against degeneration may be olfactory and environmental enrichment. There is a pressing need for more research on treatments for olfactory dysfunction and longitudinal studies including cognitive and olfactory function from patients who have recovered from even mild COVID-19.","Kay","https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00255.2022","20220727","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; dementia; neurodegeneration; olfactory bulb","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35182,""
"Oxytocin: An Old Hormone, A Novel Psychotropic Drug And Possible Use In Treating Psychiatric Disorders","Oxytocin is a nonapeptide synthesized in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. Historically, this molecule has been involved as a key factor in the formation of infant attachment, maternal behavior and pair bonding and, more generally, in linking social signals with cognition, behaviors and reward. In the last decades, the whole oxytocin system has gained a growing interest as it was proposed to be implicated in etiopathogenesis of several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. With the main goal of an in-depth understanding of the oxytocin role in the regulation of different functions and complex behaviors as well as its intriguing implications in different neuropsychiatric disorders, we performed a critical review of the current state of art. We carried out this work through PubMed database up to June 2021 with the search terms: 1) ""oxytocin and neuropsychiatric disorders""; 2) ""oxytocin and neurodevelopmental disorders""; 3) ""oxytocin and anorexia""; 4) ""oxytocin and eating disorders""; 5) ""oxytocin and obsessive-compulsive disorder""; 6) ""oxytocin and schizophrenia""; 7) ""oxytocin and depression""; 8) ""oxytocin and bipolar disorder""; 9) ""oxytocin and psychosis""; 10) ""oxytocin and anxiety""; 11) ""oxytocin and personality disorder""; 12) ""oxytocin and PTSD"". Biological, genetic, and epigenetic studies highlighted quality and quantity modifications in the expression of oxytocin peptide or in oxytocin receptor isoforms. These alterations would seem to be correlated with a higher risk of presenting several neuropsychiatric disorders belonging to different psychopathological spectra. Collaterally, the exogenous oxytocin administration has shown to ameliorate many neuropsychiatric clinical conditions. Finally, we briefly analyzed the potential pharmacological use of oxytocin in patient with severe symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and immunoregulatory properties.","Marazziti, Diep, Carter, Carbone","https://doi.org/10.2174/0929867329666220727120646","20220727","Oxytocin; exogenous oxytocin; intranasal oxytocin; neuropsychiatric disorders; oxytocin receptor; plasmatic oxytocin","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35183,""
"Factors associated with suicidal ideation during the COVID-19 pandemic in a population in the Brazilian Legal Amazon","This article aims to analyze the factors associated with suicidal ideation in the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional home-based survey, with three-stage cluster sampling, was conducted with 4,203 adults from ten municipalities in the Mato Grosso, Brazil. The data collection was carried households to assessment of sociodemographic characteristics, substance use and behavior in the pandemic. The Level 1 Symptom Cross Scale was used to identify suicidal ideation and aspects of mental health (somatic symptoms, sleep disturbances, dissociation, depression, anger, mania, anxiety, thoughts, substance use and memory).

"COVID-19: the impact on oral health care","The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the economic, social, and oral care health inequities in societies, especially in the developing world. Severe restrictions have been imposed on dental practices, limiting prophylactic and routine oral care health, allowing treatment only for emergencies. Since dental care includes procedures that generate aerosols, the risk of infection for dental personnel has increased significantly. In this review, a comprehensive and updated source of information about SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 and the impacts it is having on oral health care is presented. The ongoing repercussions in dental practice and in dental education, including the opportunities for practice innovation that are evolving, are also indicated. Also, a discussion of the psychosocial factors that affect health and the quality of life of an individual, such as stress, depression, and anxiety, is provided. This pandemic may be an opportunity to promote the inclusion of well-established prevention measures, together with the use of teledentistry in academic dental curricula, encourage the implementation of new perspectives for the effective instruction and interactions with students, and foster the transition toward e-learning strategies in dental education.","Cruz-Fierro, Borges-YÃƒÂ¡ÃƒÂ±ez, Duarte, Cordell, Rodriguez-Garcia","https://doi.org/10.1590/1413-81232022278.03522021","20220727","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35185,""
"[Psychological and behavioral problems in children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic: a Scoping review]","To investigate the psychological and behavioral problems and related influencing factors in children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched using the method of subject search for articles published up to March 31, 2022, and related data were extracted for Scoping review.

"Changes in the Care Activity in Addiction Centers with Dual Pathology Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Health care provision during the COVID-19 pandemic and confinement has led to significant changes in the activity of addiction centers. These changes in healthcare activity may have had a greater impact on patients with dual pathology. The aim of this study is to compare the treatment indicators of patients with dual pathology in addiction centers during the pre-confinement, confinement, and post-confinement periods. A retrospective observational study was conducted for the period between 1 February 2019 and 30 June 2021. A total of 2785 patients treated in specialized addiction services were divided into three periods according to their time of admission: pre-confinement, confinement, and post-confinement. During the pre-pandemic period, the addiction centers attended to an average of 121.3 (SD = 23.58) patients, decreasing to 53 patients during confinement (SD = 19.47), and 80.69 during the post-confinement period (SD = 15.33). The number of appointments scheduled monthly for each patient decreased during the confinement period, although this number increased after confinement. There was a reduction in the number of toxicological tests carried out both during and after confinement (except for alcohol). The results show a reduction in the number of patients seen and the care activity delivered to dual diagnosis patients. These results, which were caused by the COVID-preventive measures, may affect the progress and recovery of dual patients. A greater investment is needed to bring the care activity up to the standards of the years prior to confinement.","MancheÃƒÂ±o-Velasco, Dacosta-SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Blanc-Molina, Narvaez-Camargo, Lozano-Rojas","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11154341","20220727","COVID-19; care activity; drug addiction; dual pathology; mental health; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35187,""
"Stress, Anxiety and Depression Prevalence among Greek University Students during COVID-19 Pandemic: A Two-Year Survey","The negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on college students' mental health is well-demonstrated. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the pandemic on the students of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (Northern Greece), in terms of stress, anxiety, and depression, and to analyze the probable correlation of various social and phycological factors. The survey was conducted in the form of a questionnaire, which was first distributed in November 2020 and then re-launched in November 2021. The evaluation was carried out through the DASS21 screening tool. Associations regarding participants' characteristics and the three variables (stress, anxiety, and depression) were investigated with Pearson's chi-squared (ÃŽÂ§<sup>2</sup>) test. The first-year results (November 2020) revealed severe prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression (37.4%, 27.2% and 47% respectively). The second-year results (November 2021) revealed a significant augmentation in all three variables, mainly for the extreme severe scales (47.3%, 41.1% and 55% respectively). Participants who were receiving psychiatric treatment exhibited higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression, especially during the second year of the pandemic (<i>p</i>-Value &amp;lt; 0.00001). Female students' mental health was at higher risk, as elevated prevalence of negative symptoms was observed (<i>p</i>-Value &amp;lt; 0.00001). The community of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki has been greatly affected during the last 2 years. The inherent risks of the confinement measures on students' well-being and mental health are undeniable.

"[Talk About Psychological Distress and Support in Women With Gynecological Cancer: NOT Just the Disease]","Cervical cancer, uterus cancer, and ovarian cancer are three common gynecological cancers. After diagnosis, the three therapeutic modalities available for treating gynecological cancers include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. During the diagnostic and treatment periods, these patients usually suffer from physical and psychologic distresses, including menopausal symptoms, infertility, sexual dysfunction, incontinence, anxiety, depression, and relationship changes, among others. Support from family members and significant others has the potential to buffer the psychological distress perceived by patients with gynecological cancers. However, those patients who undergo invasive treatment modalities or have intimate issues such as brachytherapy, the need to use a vaginal dilator, and sexual dysfunction tend to conceal relevant information from their families or friends, which may increase self-perceived loneliness when facing the impacts of the disease and treatments. Healthcare providers may help alleviate patients' psychological stresses by providing psychological support in a timely manner, initiating discussions of intimate issues, and fulfilling patient needs for related information. In addition, healthcare providers may provide one-on-one counseling and individualized care information to increase patients' understanding of their health status. Furthermore, during the COVID-19 pandemic, patients may self-isolate to avoid becoming infected or to recuperate from a COVID-19 infection, causing social isolation or delays of cancer treatment.

"Sleep Disorders and Mental Stress of Healthcare Workers during the Two First Waves of COVID-19 Pandemic: Separate Analysis for Primary Care","During the recent pandemic, Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) presented a significant prevalence of psychological health problems and sleep disturbances. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HCPs' sleep and mental stress with a separate analysis for primary care HCPs. A cross-sectional observational study with an online anonymized, self-reported questionnaire was conducted in May 2020 (1st wave) and repeated in December 2020 (2nd wave). Patient health questionnaire-4 (PHQ-4), dimensions of anger reactions-5 (DAR-5) scale, 3-item UCLA loneliness scale (LS) and sleep condition indicator (SCI) were used. Overall, 574 participants were included from the 1st wave, 514 from the 2nd and 469 were followed during both. Anxiety and depression were significantly higher during the 2nd wave vs. the 1st (32.8% vs. 12.7%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001 and 37.7% vs. 15.8%, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). During the 2nd wave, HCPs scored significantly higher in DAR-5 (9.23 Ã‚Â± 3.82 vs. 7.3 Ã‚Â± 3.3, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) and LS (5.88 Ã‚Â± 1.90 vs. 4.9 Ã‚Â± 1.9, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001) with worse sleep quality SCI (23.7 Ã‚Â± 6.6 vs. 25.4 Ã‚Â± 3.2, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.001). This was more evident in primary care HCPs. Significant correlations were found between SCI and PHQ4, DAR5 and LS.

"Examining the Acceptability and Feasibility of the Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) Programme in Adult Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: The COSMIC Study Protocol","Kidney disease is often progressive, and patients experience diminished health-related quality of life. In addition, the impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and its associated restrictions, has brought many additional burdens. It is therefore essential that effective and affordable systems are explored to improve the psychological health of this group that can be delivered safely during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study is to support a new service development project in partnership with the UK's leading patient support charity Kidney Care UK by implementing the four-session Compassionate Mindful Resilience (CMR) programme, developed by MindfulnessUK, and explore its effectiveness for patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease or have received a kidney transplant. The study will utilise a quasi-experimental, pretest/posttest design to measure the effect of the CMR programme on anxiety, depression, self-compassion, the ability to be mindful, wellbeing, and resilience, using pre- and posttests, alongside a qualitative exploration to explore factors influencing the feasibility, acceptability, and suitability of the intervention, with patients (and the Mindfulness Teacher) and their commitment to practice. Outcomes from this study will include an evidence-based mindfulness and compassion programme for use with people with kidney disease, which is likely to have applicability across other chronic diseases.","Wilson, McKeaveney, Carswell, Atkinson, Burton, McVeigh, Graham-Wisener, JÃƒÂ¤ÃƒÂ¤skelÃƒÂ¤inen, Johnston, O'Rourke, Reid, Rej, Walsh, McArdle, Noble","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081387","20220727","COVID-19 pandemic; compassion; end-stage kidney disease; kidney transplant; mindfulness; quality of life; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35191,""
"Analysis on Burnout, Job Conditions, Alexithymia, and Other Psychological Symptoms in a Sample of Italian Anesthesiologists and Intensivists, Assessed Just before the COVID-19 Pandemic: An AAROI-EMAC Study","<b>Background</b>. It was previously reported that health care professionals working in the fields of anesthesiology and emergency are at higher risk of burnout. However, the correlations between burnout, alexithymia, and other psychological symptoms are poorly investigated. Furthermore, there is a lack of evidence on which risk factors, specific to the work of anesthetists and intensivists, can increase the risk of burnout, and which are useful for developing remedial health policies. <b>Methods</b>. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020 on a sample of 300 professionals recruited from AAROI-EMAC subscribers in Italy. Data collection instruments were a questionnaire on demographic, education, job characteristics and well-being, the Maslach Burnout Inventory Tool, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale, the Symptom Checklist-90-R, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale administered during refresher courses in anesthesiology. Correlations between burnout and physical and psychological symptoms were searched. <b>Results</b>. With respect to burnout, 29% of individuals scored at high risk on emotional exhaustion, followed by 36% at moderate-high risk. Depersonalization high and moderate-high risk were scored by 18.7% and 34.3% of individuals, respectively. Burnout personal accomplishment was scored by 34.7% of respondents. The highest mean scores of burnout dimensions were related to dissatisfaction with one's career, conflicting relationships with surgeons, and, finally, difficulty in explaining one's work to patients. <b>Conclusions</b>. Burnout rates in Italian anesthesiologists and intensivists have been worrying since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Anesthesiologists with higher levels of alexithymia are more at risk for burnout. It is therefore necessary to take urgent health policy measures..","Vittori, Marinangeli, Bignami, Simonini, Vergallo, Fiore, Petrucci, Cascella, Pedone","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081370","20220727","alexithymia; anesthesiologist; anesthesiology; anxiety; burnout; emotional exhaustion; health care professionals; intensivist; mental health; personal accomplishment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35192,""
"The Pattern of Substance Use among People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) Receiving Treatment at University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) during the COVID-19 Pandemic and the Associated Factors","There was a change in the pattern of substance usage among people who use substances during the COVID-19 pandemic period. This study aims to determine the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pattern of substance usage among people who use drugs (PWUD) receiving treatment at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) as well as levels of anxiety and depression together with coping mechanisms and the factors affecting the pattern of substance use during COVID-19 pandemic period. A cross-sectional study was applied. The questionnaire used was the Mini-European Web Survey on Drugs (EWSD): COVID-19, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Brief COPE Scale. In total, 130 PWUD were recruited. Of the participants, 36.2% of PWUD had not used/stopped the usage of illicit drugs/alcohol, 26.2% increased their usage, 20% decreased, and 14.6% used the same amount of illicit substances/alcohol during the COVID-19 pandemic period/restrictions. In addition, 28.5% of PWUD had an increased intention to seek professional support for drug counseling/treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The prevalence anxiety and depression symptoms in PWUD according to HADS was 33% and 41.5%, respectively, with depression (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and isolation status (adjusted OR = 2.63, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.05) being associated with an increase in alcohol/illicit substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. PWUD who had increased their intention to seek professional support had significantly higher odds (adjusted OR = 4.42, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.01) of reducing their alcohol/illicit substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic period. There were increased odds of maintaining alcohol/illicit substance usage among PWUD who practiced dysfunctional coping (adjusted OR = 3.87, <i>p</i> &amp;lt; 0.025) during the COVID-19 pandemic period. In conclusion, depression, isolation status, dysfunctional coping, and intention to seek professional support affected the pattern of alcohol/illicit substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic period. Strategies, substance rehabilitation/counseling, and proper mental health screening and the associated risk factors must be emphasized to prevent a further epidemic of substance use during the pandemic.","Yahaya, Yee, Sulaiman","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081366","20220727","COVID-19; PWUD (people who used drugs); anxiety; coping mechanism; depression; isolation; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35193,""
"Unmet Healthcare Needs among College Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Implications for System-Wide and Structural Changes for Service Delivery","During the COVID-19 pandemic, college students faced health disparities in addition to a negative burden on academic performance; however, little is reported in the literature regarding healthcare utilization. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among consenting college student participants aged 18 or older from a Hispanic-serving institution. Descriptive and bivariate statistics were used to analyze demographic characteristics and the types of healthcare services needed by such characteristics. Logistic regression was used to adjust for noted sex differences in associations between reporting limited healthcare services and types of healthcare services. The study population of 223 participants was mostly Hispanic/Latino (65%) and female (73%). Of the population, 11% reported they could not obtain needed healthcare services, with time being reported as the most common reason. Significant associations were found between seeking general healthcare services/routine screening, seeking mental health services, and seeking sexual health services with reporting limited healthcare services, with sex-adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of 1.90 (95% CI: 1.08, 3.36), 3.21 (95% CI: 1.44, 4.15), and 2.58 (95% CI: 1.05, 6.35), respectively. Availability and inability to obtain health services may exacerbate college student health disparities. Targeted interventions are needed in the population to mitigate the potential burdens of unmet healthcare needs, particularly among minority college students.","Becerra, Roland, Avina, Becerra","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10081360","20220727","college students; healthcare access; mental health; sexual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35194,""
"Are Pain Polymorphisms Associated with the Risk and Phenotype of Post-COVID Pain in Previously Hospitalized COVID-19 Survivors?","To investigate the association of different, selected pain polymorphisms with the presence of de novo long-COVID pain symptoms and to analyze the association between these polymorphisms with clinical, sensory-related, cognitive and psychological variables in COVID-19 survivors. Two hundred and ninety-three (<i>n</i> =293, 49.5% female, mean age: 55.6 Ã‚Â± 12.9 years) previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors participated. Three genotypes of the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were obtained from non-stimulated saliva: <i>OPRM1</i> (rs1799971), <i>COMT</i> (rs4680), <i>BDNF</i> (rs6265), and <i>HTR1B</i> (rs6296) by polymerase chain reactions in all participants. Further, clinical (intensity/duration of pain), sensory-related (sensitization-associated symptoms, neuropathic pain features), psychological (anxiety or depressive levels, sleep quality), and cognitive (catastrophizing, kinesiophobia) variables were collected in those COVID-19 survivors suffering from post-COVID pain. Analyses were carried out to associate clinical features with genotype. Participants were assessed 17.8 Ã‚Â± 5.2 months after hospitalization. One hundred and seventeen (39.9%) experienced post-COVID pain (particularly of musculoskeletal origin). The distributions of the genotype variants of any SNP were not significantly different between COVID-19 survivors with and without long-term post-COVID pain (all, <i>p</i> &amp;gt;0.178). No differences in sensitization-associated symptoms, neuropathic pain features, catastrophizing, kinesiophobia levels, anxiety and depressive levels or sleep quality according to the genotype variant in any SNPs were found. No effect of gender was identified. The four SNPs generally associated with pain did not appear to predispose to the development of de novo long-COVID pain symptoms in previously hospitalized COVID-19 survivors.

"Digital Media Influence on Adolescents' Behavior during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Self-Intravenous Injection of <i>Lactobacilli</i> Drinking Yogurt","During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, widened physical distance and social deprivation are being replaced with digital media use. The media's social function has tremendously increased following the COVID-19 era and adolescents living in a media-saturated world are the most vulnerable subjects of all. Social media use can encourage risky behavior in adolescents. Posting videos related to risk behaviors on social media has been linked to jeopardizing not only mental health but also physical safety. Herein, we report a case of a 12-year-old boy who intravenously self-injected <i>Lactobacilli</i> drinking yogurt for the purpose of filming a video to post on social media. He was treated with antibiotics based on <i>Lactobacilli</i> sepsis that cured him without any complications. In order to reduce the risk-taking behavior of adolescents, social norms need to be straightened up, and the social responsibility of hosts is strongly recommended.","Koh, Choi, Choi, Kang, Cho","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9081104","20220727","Lactobacillus; adolescence; bacteremia; digital media; drinking yogurt; self-intravenous injection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35196,""
"Cognitive Difficulties, Psychological Symptoms, and Long Lasting Somatic Complaints in Adolescents with Previous SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Telehealth Cross-Sectional Pilot Study","Few studies have evaluated cognitive functioning and mental health in children and adolescents who contracted the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated the prevalence and association of neuropsychological difficulties, psychological symptoms, and self-reported long-COVID complaints in a sample of adolescents. Thirty-one adolescents infected by COVID-19 within 3-6 months prior to the assessment were included. Neuropsychological difficulties, psychological symptoms, and self-reported long-COVID complaints were evaluated using a checklist and a battery of multiple standardized measures, using a telehealth procedure. Symptoms during the infection were also detected. We included 31 adolescents (23 girls, 8 boys; mean age 14.1, SD = 2). We found borderline scores in 32.3% and 45.2% of our sample for phonemic and category fluency, respectively. A high percentage of participants showed symptoms of depression (80.6%) and anxiety (61.3%). Fifty-eight percent reported at least one long-COVID symptom.

"Exploring Trauma and Resilience among NYS COVID-19 Pandemic Survivors","The New York State (NYS) Office of Mental Health created the NYS COVID-19 Emotional Support Helpline and enlisted graduate students to provide phone-based emotional support initially to the NYS community. This NYS-funded initiative transformed into providing psychosocial support for callers across the United States. Four NYS doctoral students acted as the helpline agents and received 251 individual calls from May-August 2020. The agents documented the calls with clinical notes which cannot be traced back to specific callers. The purpose of this retrospective qualitative study was to explore the themes that emerged from the calls to give voice to the trauma that callers were reporting during the early phases of the pandemic, and the resilience they demonstrated as they engaged with the Helpline. The agents' clinical transcripts were converted into codes using a critical-constructivist grounded theory approach (Levitt, 2021) with the NVIVO qualitative data analysis software. A second research team audited the initial codes for construct clarity. Emergent themes detailed the unique traumas that helpline callers divulged, how the agents provided support, and the callers' capacities for resilience. Recommendations are suggested to inform clinicians working with pandemic survivors, to offer guidance on providing distance or virtual interventions as well as to enhance policymakers' understanding of addressing mental health needs across populations served via the NYS COVID-19 Emotional Support Helpline.","Thompson, Eder-Moreau, Cunningham, Yamazaki, Chen","https://doi.org/10.3390/bs12080249","20220727","COVID-19; qualitative data analysis; resilience; supervision; telehealth; training; trauma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35198,""

Multivariable logistic regression was conducted to examine statistical associations. 32.5% of adults (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6402; mean age 51.6, SEÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.4) reported telehealth use. <i>Predisposing factors:</i> Women and married/partnered adults and those with higher levels of education had greater odds of using telehealth. Adults living in Midwest and South and adults living in medium-small and non-metropolitan areas had decreased odds of using telehealth. <i>Enabling factors:</i> Income and having a usual source of care were positively associated with telehealth use. A negative association was found for those with no insurance and telehealth use, whereas a positive association was found for military insurance. <i>Needs factors:</i> Odds of using telehealth were increased for adults who had well-visits and ER visits in the past 12 months. Mental health services quadrupled the odds of telehealth use. Odds of using telehealth increased with each additional chronic disease, including COVID-19. There are disparities in telehealth use according to sex, education, rurality, access to care, and health needs. Tackling these disparities is pivotal to ensure barriers to telehealth use are not exacerbated post-pandemic.","Narcisse, Andersen, Felix, Hayes, Eswaran, McElfish","https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633X221113192","20220727","Andersen's model of health services utilization; COVID-19; National Health Interview Survey; Telehealth; United States","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35199,""
"Coping with COVID Stress: Maladaptive and Adaptive Response Styles Predicting College Student Internalizing Symptom Dimensions","The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted daily life for undergraduates and introduced new stressors (e.g., campus closures). How individuals respond to stressors can interact with stress to increase disorder risk in both unique and transdiagnostic ways. The current study examined how maladaptive and adaptive stress response styles moderated the perceived severity of COVID-related stressors effect on general and specific internalizing dimensions at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in a combined undergraduate sample across two universities (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°451) using latent bifactor modeling and LASSO modeling to identify optimal predictors. Results showed that perceived stress severity and maladaptive response styles (not adaptive response styles or interactions between stress and response styles) were associated with both common and specific internalizing dimensions. Results suggest additive associations of stress severity and maladaptive coping with internalizing symptoms during the pandemic's beginning, and provide important insights for screening, prevention, and intervention during future public health crises.

"Health situation in Germany during the COVID-19 pandemic Developments over time for selected indicators of GEDA 2019/2020 - An update","The spread of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in 2020 and the containment measures associated therewith have changed many aspects of daily life. An impact on health even beyond infections itself is assumed as well. The health situation of the population in the first phase of the pandemic was thus analysed using data from the German Health Update (GEDA 2019/2020-EHIS). By continuing the survey, the analyses for 2020 are completed (n=26,507 participants), whereby the focus is now on the third phase of the pandemic (second wave of infection, gradual reintroduction of containment measures). The health indicators are presented on a monthly basis. As in the first phase of the pandemic, no pandemic-related changes were observed for tobacco smoking/ second-hand smoke exposure and for received/lack of/provided support. In contrast to the first phase of the pandemic, declines in utilisation of medical services and depressive symptoms are not observed in the third phase. The increase in body weight/body mass index after the first phase of the pandemic did not continue. The survey period allows for a comparison of the periods before and as of the pandemic situation. A decrease in the medical services utilisation and depressive symptoms as well as an increase in the body weight/body mass index is observed in the period from March 2020 to January 2021 compared to the pre-pandemic period from April 2019 to March 2020.","Damerow, Rommel, Beyer, Hapke, Schienkiewitz, Starker, Richter, Baumert, Fuchs, Gaertner, MÃƒÂ¼ters, Lemcke, Allen","https://doi.org/10.25646/9883","20220727","BMI; DEPRESSION; HEALTH CARE UTILISATION; SARS-COV-2; SMOKING; SUPPORT AT HOME","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35201,""

"Explaining individual differences in cognitive performance: The role of anxiety, social support and living arrangements during COVID-19","The present study investigated the relationship between anxiety, social support, living arrangements and cognitive performance of university students during the global pandemic. Two hundred and fifteen students participated by completing online questionnaires. Separate moderated multiple regression models were used to test whether social support (Family, Friends, Significant Other subscales of the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support) moderated the relationship between anxiety (Anxiety subscale of Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale), living arrangements (Living Alone vs Living with Friends and Family) and cognitive performance (Cognitive Failures Questionnaire), after controlling for comorbid depression. The results for each level of perceived social support suggested that anxiety was negatively associated with cognitive performance. Our most significant finding was that for students living alone, social support from a significant other offered a protective factor, whereby buffering the anxiety related cognitive deficits prevalent in those who reported lower social support.

"Parental psychological control and adolescents depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: the mediating and moderating effect of self-concept clarity and mindfulness","During the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health state of adolescents had caused widespread concern, especially the various problems caused by the relationship between adolescents and their parents in the long isolation at home. Based on the mindfulness reperceiving model and Rogers's Self-theory, this study aimed to explore the roles of adolescents' self-concept clarity and mindfulness level in the relationship between parental psychological control and adolescent depression. A total of 1,100 junior high school students from China completed the questionnaires regarding parental psychological control, depression, self-concept clarity, and mindfulness. Moderated mediation analyses suggest that parental psychological control affects adolescent depression via self-concept clarity. The association between parental psychological control and depression is moderated by self-concept clarity. The effect was stronger among adolescents with high mindfulness levels than those with low. This study suggests that it is necessary to consider both parental factors and adolescents' factors in the future. The interventions on self-concept or mindfulness may ameliorate adolescent mental problems more effectively.","Li, Ma, Feng, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-022-03445-9","20220727","Adolescent depression; COVID-19; Mindfulness; Parental psychological control; Self-concept clarity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35204,""
"Longitudinal changes in depression and anxiety during COVID-19 crisis in Uruguay","Longitudinal studies have reported decreased mental health symptoms throughout the COVID-19 crisis, while others have found improvements or no changes across time. However, most research was carried out in developed countries, with a high incidence of COVID-19 and, in several cases, mandatory lockdowns. Considering that Uruguay (a developing country) had a low COVID-19 incidence at the moment of this study and has implemented a mild lockdown, we aimed to evaluate the effect of time and mobility (using Google mobility data) on symptoms of anxiety and depression. A longitudinal panel study with six repeated measures was carried out to evaluate depressive (BDI-II) and anxiety (STAI-S) symptoms during the pandemic. A decline in symptoms of anxiety and depression was found across time. Interestingly, this effect was modulated by age; a greater difference in the symptomatology between age groups was found at the beginning of the measurements than at the end, with the youngest reporting the most severe symptoms. Finally, we found that depressive symptoms decreased as mobility increased. Overall, our findings indicate an improvement in mental health as quarantine passed and mobility increased but following a different pattern depending on age.

"Controversial COVID-19 Cures: Hydroxychloroquine and Oleander Pediatric Ingestion Simulation Cases","The use of hydroxychloroquine has dramatically increased since being touted as a potential therapeutic in combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This newfound popularity increases the risk of accidental pediatric ingestion, whereby just one or two tablets causes morbidity and mortality from seizures, cardiac dysrhythmias, and cardiogenic shock. The unique management of hydroxychloroquine overdose makes it imperative for emergency medicine physicians to have familiarity with treating this condition. Similarly, Ã¢â‚¬â€¹Ã¢â‚¬â€¹during the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been publicized cases touting extracts of oleander as being a potential therapeutic against the illness. Since it is commonly available and potentially lethal ingestion with a possible antidote, we developed a simulation case based on the available literature. The two cases were combined to create a pediatric toxicology curriculum for emergency medicine residents and medical students. Both of these treatments were selected as simulation cases since they were being touted by prominent national figuresÃ‚Â as potential cures for COVID-19. Two series of simulation cases were conducted in a high-fidelity simulation lab with emergency medicine residents and medical students. The hydroxychloroquine simulation case involved the management of a four-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia after ingesting hydroxychloroquine tablets. As the case unfolded, the child became increasingly unstable, eventually experiencing QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and ventricular fibrillation arrest requiring appropriate resuscitation to achieve a return of spontaneous circulation. The oleander simulation case involved the management of a three-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia after ingesting parts of an unknown plant. As that case progresses, the child becomes increasingly unstable, eventually experiencing atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, and degenerating into pulseless electrical activity and cardiac arrest requiring appropriate resuscitation to achieve the return of spontaneous circulation. Both series of simulation cases were modifiable based on trainee level and had the ability to include ancillary emergency department staff. Each simulation case was performed six times at our simulation center, with a total of 22 learners for the hydroxychloroquine case, and 14 for the oleander case. Through pre- and post-simulation confidence assessments, learners demonstrated increases in knowledge of toxidromes, evaluating pediatric overdoses, treating cardiac dysrhythmias, performing pediatric advanced life support, and managing post-arrest care. Learners also demonstrated improvements in recognizing the unique treatment of hydroxychloroquine and oleander toxicity, the toxic dose of both substances in a child, and the most common electrolyte anomaly seen in each toxicity. Simulation training enables learners to manage rare and complex disease processes. These cases were designed to educate trainees in recognizing and treating rare overdoses of emerging ""therapeutics"" that were touted early in the COVID-19 pandemic.","Solano, Mendelsohn, Ahmed, Shih, Clayton, Alter, Hughes","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.26176","20220727","cardiac glycosides; covid 19; oleander; pediatrics; simulation in medical education; toxicology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35206,""
"Intervention for Treating Depression in Parents of Children with Intellectual Disability of Down's Syndrome: A Sample of Nigerian Parents","A good number of parents of children with Down syndrome are prone to depressive disorders. The depressive feelings are attributed to negative perceptions of the situation, self, and the future. Given this, we explored the impact of the family health model of rational-emotive behavior therapy on depressive symptoms in parents of children with intellectual disability of Down syndrome in the COVID-19 pandemic era. This is a randomized pretest-posttest control group design that recruited 88 parents of children with intellectual disability of Down syndrome. We measured the depressive symptoms in parents at Time 1, Time 2, and Time 3 using the Beck depressive inventory and Hamilton depression rating scale. We adopted a family health model rational emotive behaviour therapy intervention in treating the depressive symptoms affecting the parents. The analysis of covariate results showed that at initial assessment there was no significant difference between the treatment group and comparison group at baseline evaluation of depressive symptoms in participants. At the posttest, it had a significant effect on the intervention on participants' depressive symptoms. Likewise, a follow-up result still shows that intervention had a significant effect on participants' depressive symptoms of participants.

"Human ACE2 Polymorphisms from Different Human Populations Modulate SARS-CoV-2 Infection","The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 6 million deaths worldwide. The high variability in COVID-19 symptoms remains one of the most interesting mysteries of the pandemic. Genetic and environmental factors are likely to be key determinants of COVID-19 symptomatology. Here, we explored ACE2 as a genetic determinant for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 symptomatology. Each human genome encodes two alleles of ACE2, which encodes the cell entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. Here, we determined whether naturally occurring human ACE2 (hACE2) polymorphisms in the human population affect SARS-CoV-2 infection and the severity of COVID-19 symptoms. ACE2 variants S19P, I21V, E23K, K26R, K31R, N33I, H34R, E35K, and T92I showed increased virus infection compared to wild-type ACE2; thus, these variants could increase the risk for COVID-19. In contrast, variants D38V, Y83H, I468V, and N638S showed reduced infection, indicating a potential protective effect. hACE2 variants K26R and T92I increased infection by three-fold without changing the levels of ACE2 on the surface of the cells, suggesting that these variants may increase the risk of severe COVID-19. On the contrary, hACE2 variants D38V and Y83H decreased SARS-CoV-2 infection by four- and ten-fold, respectively, without changing surface expression, suggesting that these variants may protect against severe COVID-19. Remarkably, all protective hACE2 Polymorphisms were found almost exclusively in Asian populations, which may provide a partial explanation for the low COVID-19 mortality rates in Asian countries. Thus, hACE2 polymorphisms may modulate susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in the host and partially account for the differences in severity of COVID-19 among different ethnic groups.","Hu, Bauer, Sawyer, Diaz-Griffero","https://doi.org/10.3390/v14071451","20220727","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; human ACE2; infection; polymorphisms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35208,""
"COVID-19 Vaccine for Children: Vaccination Willingness of Parents and Its Associated Factors-A Network Analysis","Different COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for underage children, so parents and caregivers currently face the decision of whether to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 or not. Due to the rather moderate vaccine acceptance among parents across different countries, the objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between different psychological, demographic, and behavioral factors related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for underage children among parents. In particular, vaccination attitudes, whether parents have been vaccinated against COVID-19 themselves, COVID-19 fear, attitude towards COVID-19 policy measures, governmental trust, subjective level of information, perceived risk of disease progression, and perceived risk of vaccine side effects were the variables of interest. The study adopted a cross-sectional study design, and the sample consisted of 2405 participants. A network analysis was conducted to investigate the associations and interconnection among these variables. The results showed that, in particular, compliance, confidence in the safety of vaccines, whether parents have been vaccinated against COVID-19 themselves, trust in the governmental system, fear of COVID-19, and the parents' age were directly related to the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine for children. To increase compliance and confidence in the vaccines' safety among parents, promotion campaigns should provide more information concerning the vaccines' safety, particularly for younger parents who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 themselves.","Krakowczyk, BÃƒÂ¤uerle, Pape, Kaup, Nulle, Teufel, Skoda","https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines10071155","20220727","COVID-19; mental health; network analysis; vaccine acceptance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35209,""

Using fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assays, we studied the effects of quinolinic acid (QA) and gentamicin, with or without L-glutamate and REL-1017, on intracellular calcium ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub>) in recombinant cell lines expressing human GluN1-GluN2A, GluN1-GluN2B, GluN1-GluN2C, and GluN1-GluN2D NMDAR subtypes. There were no effects of QA on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> in cells expressing GluN1-GluN2C subtypes. QA acted as a low-potency, subtype-selective, NMDAR partial agonist in GluN1-GluN2A, GluN1-GluN2B, and GluN1-GluN2D subtypes. REL-1017 reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> induced by QA. In cells expressing the GluN1-GluN2D subtype, QA acted as an agonist in the presence of 0.04 ÃŽÂ¼M L-glutamate and as an antagonist in the presence of 0.2 ÃŽÂ¼M L-glutamate. REL-1017 reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> induced by L-glutamate alone and with QA in all cell lines. In the absence of L-glutamate, gentamicin had no effect. Gentamicin was a positive modulator for GluN1-GluN2B subtypes at 10 ÃŽÂ¼M L-glutamate, for GluN1-GluN2A at 0.2 ÃŽÂ¼M L-glutamate, and for GluN1-GluN2A, GluN1-GluN2B, and GluN1-GluN2D at 0.04 ÃŽÂ¼M L-glutamate. No significant changes were observed with GluN1-GluN2C NMDARs. REL-1017 reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> induced by the addition of L-glutamate in all NMDAR cell lines in the presence or absence of gentamicin. In conclusion, REL-1017 reduced [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>in</sub> induced by L-glutamate alone and when increased by QA and gentamicin.

"A Real Pandora's Box in Pandemic Times: A Narrative Review on the Acute Cardiac Injury Due to COVID-19","The intricate relationship between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the cardiovascular system is an extensively studied pandemic topic, as there is an ever-increasing amount of evidence that reports a high prevalence of acute cardiac injury in the context of viral infection. In patients with Coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19, a significant increase in serum levels of cardiac troponin or other various biomarkers was observed, suggesting acute cardiac injury, thus predicting both a severe course of the disease and a poor outcome. Pathogenesis of acute cardiac injury is not yet completely elucidated, though several mechanisms are allegedly involved, such as a direct cardiomyocyte injury, oxygen supply-demand inequity caused by hypoxia, several active myocardial depressant factors during sepsis, and endothelial dysfunction due to the hyperinflammatory status. Moreover, the increased levels of plasma cytokines and catecholamines and a significantly enhanced prothrombotic environment may lead to the destabilization and rupture of atheroma plaques, subsequently triggering an acute coronary syndrome. In the present review, we focus on describing the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with acute cardiac injury in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explore some novel therapeutic strategies involving immunomodulatory therapy, as well as their role in preventing a severe form of the disease, with both the short-term outcome and the long-term cardiovascular sequelae being equally important in patients with SARS-CoV-2 induced acute cardiac injury.","Timpau, Miftode, Leca, Timpau, Miftode, Petris, Costache, Mitu, Nicolae, Oancea, Jigoranu, Tuchilus, Miftode","https://doi.org/10.3390/life12071085","20220727","COVID-19; biomarkers; cytokines; heart failure; myocardial injury","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35211,""

The results indicate a higher rate of anxiety among women than among men and reveal a relationship between higher levels of anxiety and more vulnerable work situations in terms of higher unemployment rates, contract changes, etc. Furthermore, there was a higher percentage of women than men in the sectors where the health crisis has had a greater impact and presence, with repercussions on the physical, mental, and social health of the entire population and especially on women. It is necessary to take into account the social determinants of health, not only at the structural level, in terms of the socio-economic and political contexts, to avoid and limit the axes of inequality such as gender.","Iglesias MartÃƒÂ­nez, Roces GarcÃƒÂ­a, JimÃƒÂ©nez Arberas, Llosa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148849","20220727","SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; mental health; sanitary crisis; social determinants; women","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35214,""
"Health-Related Quality of Life of Moroccan COVID-19 Survivors: A Case-Control Study","Research on COVID-19 has mostly focused on transmission, mortality and morbidity associated with the virus. However, less attention has been given to its impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the demographic and clinical risk factors associated with COVID-19 and evaluate its impact on the HRQoL of COVID-19 survivors. A case-control study was carried out between September 2021 and March 2022 on 1105 participants. A total of 354 were COVID-19 survivors and 751 were the control group. The HRQoL was assessed using both EQ-5D-5L and SF-6D generic instruments. The average age of all participants was 56.17 Ã‚Â± 15.46. Older age, urban area, tobacco use, presence of chronic diseases especially type 1 diabetes, kidney and cardiovascular diseases were significantly associated with COVID-19. The COVID-19 survivors had significantly lower HRQoL (EQ-VAS = 50.89) compared to the control group (EQ-VAS = 63.36) (<i>p</i>-value &amp;lt; 0.0001). Pain/ discomfort and anxiety/depression were the most negatively affected by COVID-19 (<i>p</i>-value &amp;lt; 0.0001).

"Health-Related Quality of Life and Depressive Symptomatology in High School Students during the Lockdown Period Due to SARS-CoV-2","The objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the prevalence of health-related quality of life and depressive symptomatology in high school students during the lockdown period due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with students attending the High School Education System of the University of Guadalajara, Jalisco, MÃƒÂ©xico. Through a Google Forms survey, students answered their perceptions of health-related quality of life and depressive symptomatology. The outcome variable was the presence of depressive symptoms, assessed using the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI). Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.8 in both surveys. A total of 1446 students participated (women, 64.9%; mean age of 16.1 Ã‚Â± 0.9 years). Among the students, 22% manifested clinical depressive symptoms (24.4 Ã‚Â± 5.0), and males showed lower scores on health-related quality of life and depressive symptoms (44.9 Ã‚Â± 11.9, <i>p</i> = 0.005) (12 Ã‚Â± 7.7, <i>p</i> = &amp;lt;0.001) compared to their female peers (45.2 Ã‚Â± 10.6, <i>p</i> = 0.005) (13.7 Ã‚Â± 7.5, <i>p</i> = &amp;lt;0.001), respectively.

"The Advantages of the Zero-COVID-19 Strategy","<b>Introduction</b>: To curb the COVID-19 pandemic, countries across the globe have adopted either a mitigation or anelimination policy, such as the zero-COVID-19 strategy. However, further research is needed to systematically investigate the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy in the literature. To bridge the research gap, this study examines the zero-COVID-19 strategy in terms of its advantages as a global anti-pandemic framework. <b>Methods</b>: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus to locate academic articles that discussed the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy. Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis approach was adopted to guide the data analysis process. <b>Results</b>: The findings of our study show that the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy range from short-term (e.g., limited virus infections, hospitalizations, and deaths), to medium-term (e.g., reduced presence of other infectious diseases), and long-term (e.g., low incidence of long COVID-19). While local residents mainly leverage these advantages, they also impact the global community (e.g., stable global supply of essentials, such as COVID-19 vaccines). <b>Conclusions</b>: COVID-19 is catastrophic, yet controllable. Our study examined the advantages of the zero-COVID-19 strategy from a nuanced perspective and discussed how these advantages benefit both the local and the global community in pandemic control and management. Future studies could investigate the shortcomings of the zero-COVID-19 strategy, especially its unintended consequences, such as adverse impacts on vulnerable populations' mental health, so that society could more efficiently, economically, and empathetically capitalize on the potential of the zero-COVID-19 strategy for the betterment of personal and public health.","Su, Cheshmehzangi, McDonnell, Ahmad, Ã…Â egalo, Xiang, da Veiga","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148767","20220727","COVID-19; coronavirus; public health policies; virus elimination; zero-COVID-19 strategy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35217,""
"Investigating the Buffering Effects of Greenery on the Adverse Emotional, Mental and Behavioral Health during the Pandemic Period","In light of the adverse emotional, mental and behavioral outcomes caused by the pandemic period, this research analyzed the associations between emotional distress and poor health outcomes and the buffering effects of greenery on these outcomes. An online cross-sectional survey between June-November 2021 was distributed among 1314 young Italian adults. Bivariate associations and multivariate regression analyses were applied to the data. Findings showed that emotional distress was positively related to poor mental health outcomes and to some of the unhealthy behaviors. In addition, green pathways differently impacted on health: the indoor features confirmed buffering effects on adverse emotional and mental health responses, whereas the outdoor features played no salutogenic role. In conclusion, whereas the outbreak period of the pandemic has led to the rediscovering/reinforcement of the attachment to nature to cope with negative affective states, the successive waves characterized by selected limitations and new living rules of social adaptation may have brought about a reduced affinity toward nature. Target interventions in terms of biophilic design for indoor environmental sustainability are needed in order to increase the innate human-nature connection and thus to promote public health.","Contini, Di Nuovo, Sinatra, Osmanaj, Monacis","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148749","20220727","COVID-19; behavioral health; buffering effects; emotional health; greenery; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35218,""
"How Daily Obstacles Affect Frontline Healthcare Professionals' Mental Health during Omicron: A Daily Diary Study of Handwashing Behavior","Based on coping theory, the current research examines how and why COVID-19 phobia affects frontline healthcare professionals' mental health, as well as their burnout and work-related stress. We focused on the mediating role of burnout and work-related stress in this study. In the current study, we also examined the moderating influence of healthcare professionals' handwashing behavior using the Hayes Process model. We employed a daily diary approach to collect data from respondents in Pakistan's frontline healthcare professionals (<i>n</i> = 79, 79 Ãƒâ€” 10 = 790) who were directly treating COVID-19 patients during the omicron wave. According to the findings of the study, COVID-19 phobia significantly disturbs healthcare professionals' mental health, as well as significantly strengthens burnout and work-related stress. The findings also demonstrated that burnout significantly negatively influences mental health. The mediation influence of burnout and work-related stress in the association between COVID-19 phobia and mental health has shown to be significant. The moderation analysis revealed that high handwashing behavior significantly buffers the negative impact of COVID-19 phobia, as well as the adverse effect of burnout on healthcare professionals' mental health. Moreover, our findings have theoretical and managerial implications, as well as new research directions for scholars to understand the adverse impact of daily obstacles on professionals' (nurses and doctors, etc.) mental health and work performance, as well as issues based on resource conversation philosophy.","Khan, Hassan, Bahader, Fatima, Zaidi, Virk, Jiang, Jiang","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148748","20220727","COVID-19 phobia; burnout; handwashing behavior; mental health; omicron wave; work-related stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35219,""
"The Impact of Mental Health and Sociodemographic Characteristics on Quality of Life and Life Satisfaction during the Second Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic-Results of a Population-Based Survey in Germany","A decreased quality of life was shown for numerous factors at the beginning of the pandemic. However, it is important to identify people who are at-risk for long-term impairments during the pandemic and its aftermath. Within this study, we aimed to investigate quality of life within a German population-based sample (2515 participants; 51.6% female; mean age 50.09 years) during the second year of the pandemic (2021). Our results showed that the majority reported no pandemic-associated change in quality of life at this state of the pandemic. Higher life satisfaction was associated with fewer mental health problems, no pre-existing somatic and psychiatric disorders, higher income, no income loss during the pandemic, living with others, and younger age. In contrast, in a high-risk group encompassing participants with lower quality of life, only mental health, pre-existing somatic disorders, and living alone had significant associations with quality of life, indicating a smaller scope for improvement in this high-risk group. Age, income loss, and depressive symptoms predicted a decrease in quality of life since the beginning of the pandemic. Our results highlight the importance of mental health, especially in times of pandemic, and underline the need for low-threshold mental health support.","GeprÃƒÂ¤gs, BÃƒÂ¼rgin, Fegert, BrÃƒÂ¤hler, Clemens","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148734","20220727","COVID-19; depressive symptoms; life satisfaction; mental health; pandemic; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35220,""
"Human Flow Dataset Reveals Changes in Citizens' Outing Behaviors including Greenspace Visits before and during the First Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Kanazawa, Japan","Greenspaces, including parks, provide various socio-ecological benefits such as for aesthetics, temperature remediation, biodiversity conservation, and outdoor recreation. The health benefits of urban greenspaces have received particular attention since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has triggered various movement restrictions and lifestyle changes, including regarding the frequency of people's visits to greenspaces. Using mobile-tracking GPS data of Kanazawa citizens, we explored how citizens' behaviors with respect to outings changed before and during Japan's declaration of a COVID-19 state of emergency (April-May 2020). We also examined citizens' greenspace visits in relation to their travel distance from home. We found that Kanazawa citizens avoided going out during the pandemic, with a decrease in the number, time, and distance of outings. As for the means of transportation, the percentage of outings by foot increased on both weekdays and holidays. While citizens refrained from going out, the percentage change of the percentage in large greenspace visits increased very slightly in 2020. As for greenspace visitation in 2020 compared to 2019, we found that citizens generally visited greenspaces closer to their homes, actually increasing visitation of nearby (within 1000 m) greenspaces. This study of how outing behaviors and greenspace use by Kanazawa citizens have changed underscores the value of nearby greenspaces for physical and mental health during movement restrictions under the pandemic.","Ueno, Kato, Mase, Funamoto, Hasegawa","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148728","20220727","COVID-19 pandemic; behavioral change; human flow; mental health; urban greenspace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35221,""
"Resilience Improves the Quality of Life and Subjective Happiness of Physiotherapists during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Resilience is an individual characteristic that protects mental health. However, its impact on the lives of Brazilian physiotherapists during COVID-19 is not known. This study aimed to analyze whether resilience modulates the perceived quality of life (QoL) and subjective happiness (SH) of physiotherapists who work with COVID-19 patients, compared with those who do not. A cross-sectional study was conducted between 22 August and 22 October 2020. Physiotherapists working in critical and non-critical hospital sectors were invited to participate in the study. The participants completed sociodemographic questionnaires and were graded on the 14-item Resilience Scale, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and the Subjective Happiness Scale. In total, 519 physiotherapists were enrolled in the study. Physiotherapists with low resilience who worked with COVID-19 patients reported lower scores on the SF-36 subscales (except for social functioning) and the Subjective Happiness Scale, compared with those with high resilience who did not work with COVID-19 patients. These responses were modulated by age, sex, absence from work, receipt of personal protective equipment, host leadership, and practice and maintenance of regular physical activity. In conclusion, physiotherapists with low resilience who worked with COVID-19 patients presented lower perceptions of QoL and SH, compared with the other study participants.","Pigati, Righetti, Dourado, Nisiaymamoto, Saraiva-Romanholo, TibÃƒÂ©rio","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19148720","20220727","COVID-19; happiness; physiotherapists; quality of life; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35222,""
"Cross-Cultural Adaptation and Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale for Chinese University Students: A Cross-Sectional Study","fear of COVID-19 is widespread among the population, especially among college students because of their increased exposure to the media information overload of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Fear of COVID-19 scale (FCV-19 S) is a relatively short instrument used to evaluate fears surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the validity and reliability of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale have not been fully investigated in Chinese university student groups. this study assessed the cross-cultural adaptability and reliability of the FCV-19S for Chinese university students. a Chinese version of Fear of COVID-19 Scale (C-FCV-19S) was generated using the translation-backward translation method. Psychometric properties of the C-FCV-19S, including internal consistency, split-half reliability, construct reliability, convergent validity, and diagnostic accuracy, were evaluated. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7) scales were also used to evaluate participants for depression and anxiety. the C-FCV-19S has acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: 0.872) and satisfactory split-half reliability (correlation coefficient: 0.799). Using the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), we examined the construct reliability (KMO = 0.920). The confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed that the bifactor model of scale (including general factor, factor1: the awareness of COVID-19 and physiological arousal, factor 2: fear-related thinking) had a good fit index (Ãâ€¡2/df =6.18, RMSEA= 0.067, SRMR = 0.028, GFI = 0.986, TLI = 0.970 and CFI= 0.988). Using depression-positive and anxiety-positive scores as reference criteria, we found that the areas under the curve were 0.70 and 0.68, respectively, and that the optimal cutoff scores of the C-FCV-19S was 17.5 (sensitivity: 66.3% and 58.7%, respectively). the validity and reliability of C-FCV-19S are satisfactory, and the optimal cutoff point was 17.5.

We examined the psychopathological variations in relation to mental health problems in a young population. The goal was to develop interventions to resolve these new psychosocial problems. From June to July 2020, students participated in an anonymous survey asking about habits and symptoms that emerged during the lockdown and the COVID-19 pandemic. Five health outcomes were assessed: digestive disorders; headaches; fear of COVID-19; panic and anxiety crises; and depression/sadness. The conditions and duration of the social isolation, lifestyle, SARS-CoV-2 infection in the household, financial situation, and productivity were considered in the analysis. A total of 3533 students completed the survey. The participants experienced headaches, depression and sadness, digestive disorders, a fear of COVID-19, and anxiety/panic crises. The duration of isolation was associated with an increased risk of digestive disorders, headaches, and COVID-19 fear. The female gender, medium-intense telephone usage, sleep quality, memory difficulties, and performance reduction were associated with an increased risk of the health outcomes.

Data were collected in March-June 2021 via an online survey from 15,366 university students from 17 universities in seven ASEAN countries. Analyzed data comprised results on physical activity, health-related behaviors, mental well-being, and sociodemographic information. A large proportion of university students consumed sugar-sweetened beverages (82.0%; 95%CI: 81.4, 82.6) and snacks/fast food daily (65.2%; 95%CI: 64.4, 66.0). About half (52.2%; 95%CI: 51.4, 53.0) consumed less than the recommended daily amounts of fruit/vegetable and had high salt intake (54%; 95%CI: 53.3, 54.8). Physical inactivity was estimated at 39.7% (95%CI: 38.9, 40.5). A minority (16.7%; 95%CI: 16.1, 17.3) had low mental well-being, smoked (8.9%; 95%CI: 8.4, 9.3), and drank alcohol (13.4%; 95%CI: 12.8, 13.9). Country and body mass index had a significant correlation with many health-risk behaviors and mental well-being.

"Mental Health Support for Hospital Staff during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Characteristics of the Services and Feedback from the Providers","French authorities created mental health support services to accompany HCWs during the pandemic. We aimed to obtain feedback from staff providing these mental health support services within French hospitals to identify positive and negative features and avenues for improvement. A mixed-methods study was performed between 1 April and 30 June 2020. We contacted 77 centres to identify those providing mental health support services. We developed a questionnaire containing questions about the staff providing the service (quantitative part), with open questions to enable feedback from service providers (qualitative part). Of the 77 centres, 36 had mental health support services; 77.8% were created specifically for the epidemic. Services were staffed principally by psychologists, mainly used a telephone platform, and had a median opening time of 8 h/day. Thirty-seven professionals provided feedback, most aged 35-49 years. For 86.5%, it was their first time providing such support. Median self-reported comfort level was 8 (interquartiles 3-10), and 95% would do it again. Respondents reported (i) difficulties with work organisation, clinical situations, and lack of recognition and (ii) a desire for training.

A representative sample (<i>n</i> = 214) was drawn from a total survey sample of 3052 adolescents aged 14-20. The analysis revealed several areas of concern, including school-related concerns, concerns about restrictions, self-related concerns, and interpersonal problems. School-related concerns associated with distance learning were mentioned most frequently. Compared with research conducted at the beginning of the pandemic, it appeared that concerns about educational and professional futures increased. The analysis also indicated young people's most important sources of support, such as social contacts, recreational activities, attitudes and abilities, distraction, and escape. Of concern is the proportion of young people citing maladaptive coping strategies and the reluctance to seek professional support.

"Work Engagement, Work Environment, and Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study in Ecuador","Work environments can interfere with the mental health of workers as generators or reducers of psychological distress. Work engagement is a concept related to quality of life and efficiency at work. The aim of this study was to find the relationship between work environment factors and work engagement among the Ecuadorian general population during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic to assess their levels of psychological distress. For this purpose, a cross-sectional, descriptive study using a set of questionnaires was performed. Sociodemographic and work environment data, work engagement (UWES-9 scale) scores, and General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) scores were collected. The variables that predicted 70.2% of psychological distress during the first phase of the pandemic were being female, with a low level of vigour (work engagement dimension), being stressed at work, and low job satisfaction. The sample showed an intermediate level of engagement in both the global assessment and the three dimensions, being higher in those without psychological distress. With effective actions on work environment factors, mental health effects may be efficiently prevented, and work engagement may be benefited. Companies can reduce workers' psychological distress by providing safe and effective means to prevent the risk of contagion; reducing the levels of work conflict, work stress, or workload; and supporting their employees with psychological measures in order to maintain ideal working conditions.","Ruiz-Frutos, AdanaquÃƒÂ©-Bravo, Ortega-Moreno, Fagundo-Rivera, Escobar-Segovia, Arias-Ulloa, GÃƒÂ³mez-Salgado","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10071330","20220727","COVID-19; Ecuador; mental health; psychological distress; work engagement; work environment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35229,""
"Quality of Life and Mental Health Status in Recovered COVID-19 Subjects at Two Years after Infection in Taizhou, China: A Longitudinal Cohort Study","According to previous studies, mental status in 1-year COVID-19 survivors might range from 6-43%. Longer-term psychological consequences in recovered COVID-19 subjects are unknown, so we analyzed longer-term quality of life and mental status in recovered COVID-19 subjects at 2 years after infection. Among 144 recovered COVID-19 subjects in the Taizhou region, 73 and 45 completed face-to-face follow-ups at the first year and second year after infection, respectively, with a 61.7% follow-up rate. The questionnaire, which was administered at both follow-ups, included questions about quality of life, psychological health, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The Mann-Whitney U test was used to the differences of each scale between the first and second year. Among the 45 people who completed both follow-up visits, the incidence of psychological problems was 4.4% (2/45) in the first year, and no new psychological abnormalities were observed in the second year. Quality of life improved, while the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores did not improve over time. The incidence of mental disorders was lower than those in previous studies. Multidisciplinary management for COVID-19 in this study hospital may have reduced the frequency to a certain extent. However, among those with mental health problems, such problems may exist for a long time, and long-term attention should be given to the psychological status of recovered COVID-19 subjects.","Pan, Zhou, Wang, Zheng, Yu, Kang, Zhang, Peng, Tung, Shen","https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci12070939","20220727","COVID-19; GHQ-12; PTSD; multidisciplinary; quality of life; recovered subjects","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35230,""
"Russian adolescent mental health in 2002, 2015 and during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021","Adolescent mental health is a global concern, however, time trends and the COVID-19-related restrictions vary across countries. This study examined changes in adolescent mental health and substance use in Russia between 2002, 2015 and during the pandemic in 2021. Cross-sectional school-based surveys of 12- to 18-year-olds were carried out in a Siberian city in 2002 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°713), 2015 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°840) and 2021 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°721) using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, data on tobacco, alcohol and drug use and socio-demographic information. We examined the effect of cohort, gender, family composition and parental occupation on mental health and substance use. There were increases in emotional symptoms and internalising problems (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.93, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and decreases in substance use over 19Ã¢â‚¬â€°years (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-.73, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Changes in adolescent mental health and substance use were substantial from 2002 to 2015 and nonsignificant from 2015 to 2021. Increases in mental health problems were evident only among girls; a decrease in alcohol use was larger among boys. Family composition and parental occupation did not account for these changes. These results suggest that the mental health of Russian adolescent girls has worsened in the 21st century; the gender gap in mental health has widened; the gender gap in alcohol use was reversed in 2021. The findings highlight the need for research into gender-specific factors and for effective interventions. The lack of changes in Russian adolescent mental health and substance use from 2015 to during the pandemic in 2021 suggests successful coping; however, more research is needed.","Slobodskaya, Safronova, Kharchenko, Rezun, Kornienko","https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12591","20220726","Mental health; adolescents; gender difference; prosocial behaviour; substance use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35231,""
"Association of Changes of lifestyle behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic with mental health: a longitudinal study in children and adolescents","We examined the prospective associations of changes in lifestyle behaviors before/during the COVID-19 pandemic, namely physical activity and screen time, with mental health. Furthermore, the impacts of physical activity and screen time on mental health during the pandemic were examined cross-sectionally. A two-wave longitudinal study was conducted among 2423 children and adolescents in Shanghai, China. Lifestyle behavior variables (physical activity and screen time) and psychological variables (depressive symptoms, anxiety, and stress) were measured using a self-reported questionnaire in January and March 2020. A series of multivariable logistic regressions were performed to examine the associations between changes in lifestyle behaviors in two waves and psychological problems. The combined associations of physical activity and screen time with psychological problems were also explored using the second wave data. Compared to students with persistently short screen time before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, those with prolonged screen time (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â·36 for depression, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â·48 for anxiety) and those with persistently long screen time (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â·70 for depression, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2Ã‚Â·13 for anxiety) reported a higher risk of psychological symptoms. The association between changes in physical activity and psychological symptoms was not statistically significant after adjustment for demographic factors, socioeconomic status, and screen time. During the COVID-19 pandemic, engaging in longer screen time (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â·44 for depression, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1Ã‚Â·55 for anxiety) was associated with worsened psychological conditions, while engaging in increased physical activity (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0Ã‚Â·58 for depression, ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0Ã‚Â·66 for anxiety) was associated with better psychological conditions. Our study suggests that promoting physical activity and limiting leisure screen time during the COVID-19 pandemic are important to prevent and mitigate psychological problems in children and adolescents. Therefore, effective interventions targeting lifestyle behaviors are needed to protect children and adolescents' physical and mental health.","Xiang, Liu, Yamamoto, Mizoue, Kuwahara","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-022-01327-8","20220726","COVID-19; Change of lifestyle behavior; Children and adolescents; Mental health; Physical activity; Screen time","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35232,""
"Disparities in naloxone prescriptions in a University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic","Per the CDC, it is estimated that 69,710 opioid overdose deaths occurred in the United States from September 2019 to September 2020. However, it is unclear whether naloxone prescribing also increased or otherwise fluctuated in this time. The objective of this study was to characterize the naloxone prescribing rate in patients with opioid use disorder (OUD) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital in 2019 and 2020. A cross-sectional, retrospective medical record review was performed on patients with OUD from January 2019 through December 2020. Naloxone prescribing, defined as either a written prescription or a provided take-home kit, was assessed for all patients with OUD. In 2019, 11,959 visits were made by 2962 unique patients with OUD, compared to 11,661 visits from 2,641 unique patients in 2020; 609 naloxone prescriptions were provided in 2019 (5.1%) and 619 in 2020 (5.3%). In both years, most OUD-related visits and naloxone prescriptions were from and to male, white, individuals. Compared with 2019, more naloxone prescriptions were given to uninsured patients in 2020 (33.2% vs 44.3%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), and more OUD patients were admitted to inpatient settings (26.0% vs 31.2%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) and received more naloxone prescriptions in the inpatient setting (46.3% vs 62.0%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05) in 2020. The proportion of frequent users (i.e., visitsÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°4 times/year) increased in 2020 for the emergency department (21.5% vs 26.4%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and inpatient setting (24.9% vs 28.6%, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.03). Our findings indicate the need for improving naloxone awareness in providers and prescribing for patients with OUD, particularly in emergency department and outpatient settings. Our results also demonstrated a disparity in naloxone prescribing; a disproportionate number of opioid-related emergency department visits and overdose deaths were noted in Black people and frequent users.","Chieh, Patel, Walter, Li","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-022-00667-9","20220726","Health disparities; Naloxone; Opioid overdose; Opioid use disorder; Prevention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35233,""
"Psychosocial burden in nurses working in nursing homes during the Covid-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study with quantitative and qualitative data","The Covid-19 pandemic led to increased work-related strain and psychosocial burden in nurses worldwide, resulting in high prevalences of mental health problems. Nurses in long-term care facilities seem to be especially affected by the pandemic. Nevertheless, there are few findings indicating possible positive changes for health care workers. Therefore, we investigated which psychosocial burdens and potential positive aspects nurses working in long-term care facilities experience during the Covid-19 pandemic. We conducted a mixed-methods study among nurses and nursing assistants working in nursing homes in Germany. The survey contained the third German version of the Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ III). Using Welch's t-tests, we compared the COPSOQ results of our sample against a pre-pandemic reference group of geriatric nurses from Germany. Additionally, we conducted semi-structured interviews with geriatric nurses with a special focus on psychosocial stress, to reach a deeper understanding of their experiences on work-related changes and burdens during the pandemic. Data were analysed using thematic coding (Braun and Clarke). Our survey sample (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°177) differed significantly from the pre-pandemic reference group in 14 out of 31 COPSOQ scales. Almost all of these differences indicated negative changes. Our sample scored significantly worse regarding the scales 'quantitative demands', 'hiding emotions', 'work-privacy conflicts', 'role conflicts', 'quality of leadership', 'support at work', 'recognition', 'physical demands', 'intention to leave profession', 'burnout', 'presenteeism' and 'inability to relax'. The interviews (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°15) revealed six main themes related to nurses' psychosocial stress: 'overall working conditions', 'concern for residents', 'management of relatives', 'inability to provide terminal care', 'tensions between being infected and infecting others' and 'technicisation of care'. 'Enhanced community cohesion' (interviews), 'meaning of work' and 'quantity of social relations' (COPSOQ III) were identified as positive effects of the pandemic. Results clearly illustrate an aggravation of geriatric nurses' situation and psychosocial burden and only few positive changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Pre-existing hardships seem to have further deteriorated and new stressors added to nurses' strain. The perceived erosion of care, due to an overemphasis of the technical in relation to the social and emotional dimensions of care, seems to be especially burdensome to geriatric nurses.","Schulze, Merz, Thier, Tallarek, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Uhlenbrock, NÃƒÂ¼bling, Lincke, Rapp, Spallek, Holmberg","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08333-3","20220726","COPSOQ; Covid-19; Mixed-methods study; Nurses; Nursing home; Psychosocial burden","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35234,""
"The effects of family-centered empowerment model on depression, anxiety, and stress of the family caregivers of patients with COVID-19: a randomized clinical trial","Taking care of patients with Covid-19 is regarded as a challenging task for family caregivers. Hence, a Family-Centered Empowerment Model (FCEM) should help them achieve greater psychological strength throughout the home healthcare process. This studyÃ‚Â is a randomized clinical trial with two groups; besides, pre-test and post-test designs were conducted based on the CONSORT checklistÃ‚Â from April to July 2020, in Iran.Ã‚Â Seventy familyÃ‚Â caregivers were randomly assigned to FCEM (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35) and control (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°35) groups. Then, four stages of FCEM in four online sessions were provided to the participants of the intervention group via WhatsApp messenger. The procedure started at the patient's discharge and continued for two weeks. The demographic information questionnaire and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) were employed before and five days after the FCEM sessions to gather the required data. The sample was made up of 55.8% women and 44.2% men caregivers, with a mean age of 42.5Ã‚Â years. The results demonstrated a substantial difference in the average score of stress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.023), anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.003), and depression (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.012). The combination of a face-to-face orientation session and online methods of FCEM is likely to lower stress, anxiety, and depression in familyÃ‚Â caregivers, which can be contributed to the practicability, simplicity, and effectiveness of this home healthÃ‚Â intervention.

"Mindfulness in Schools: Evidence on the Impacts of School-Based Mindfulness Programs on Student Outcomes in Pâ€“12 Educational Settings","This Research Brief was developed for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The number of school-based mindfulness programs (SBMPs) for students has been increasing over the last fifteen years. Theyâ€™ve been developed for students from pre- kindergarten through high school (Pâ€“12 settings). While the reach of SBMPs is substantial, their introduction has outpaced research on their effectiveness across diverse sociocultural contexts and school environments, and with students of different ages and backgrounds. A look at studies conducted between 2000 and 2019 showed that SBMPs improve studentsâ€™ mindfulness and self-regulation skills. Further, there is promising evidence that these programs reduce studentsâ€™ feelings of anxiety and depression, support their physical health, and assist them in engaging in healthy relationships with others. However, there is little consistent evidence at this time that SBMPs reduce studentsâ€™ anger and aggression or improve their well-being, and further study is needed to adequately assess program impacts on studentsâ€™ school behavior and performance. In the coming years, more scientific research on SBMPs is needed to determine: which kinds of practices and program elements work best, what outcomes they influence, and which students are impacted the most. Recommendations for practitioners considering the use of SBMPs are offered.","Robert W Roeser et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E01B9-3F7-ABA","20220727","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology|Learner; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Toddlerhood/Preschool Period; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Educational Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Social Development; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; education; review; students; social-emotional development; prevention; school-based mindfulness programs; mindfulness; attention; randomized controlled trials; prek to secondary education","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-28","",35236,""
