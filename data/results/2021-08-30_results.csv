"Novel Coronavirus Pandemic Impacts Children and Adolescents' Psychological Well-Being in Heavily Hit Chinese Provinces","In light of the novel coronavirus'(COVID-19's) threat to public health worldwide, we sought to elucidate COVID-19's impacts on the mental health of children and adolescents in China. Through online self-report questionnaires, we aimed to discover the psychological effects of the pandemic and its associated risk factors for developing mental health symptoms in young people. We disseminated a mental health survey through online social media, WeChat, and QQ in the five Chinese provinces with the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the late stage of the country-wide lockdown. We used a self-made questionnaire that queried children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 on demographic information, psychological status, and other lifestyle and COVID-related variables. A total of 17,740 children and adolescents with valid survey data participated in the study. 10,022 (56.5%), 11,611 (65.5%), 10,697 (60.3%), 6,868 (38.7%), and 6,225 (35.1%) participants presented, respectively, more depressive, anxious, compulsive, inattentive, and sleep-related problems compared to before the outbreak of COVID-19. High school students reported a greater change in depression and anxiety than did middle school and primary school students. Despite the fact that very few children (0.1%) or their family members (0.1%) contracted the virus in this study, the psychological impact of the pandemic was clearly profound. Fathers'anxiety appeared to have the strongest influence on a children's psychological symptoms, explaining about 33% of variation in the child's overall symptoms. Other factors only explained less than 2% of the variance in symptoms once parents'anxiety was accounted for. The spread of COVID-19 significantly influenced the psychological state of children and adolescents. It is clear that children and adolescents, particularly older adolescents, need mental health support during the pandemic. The risk factors we uncovered suggest that reducing fathers'anxiety is particularly critical to addressing young people's mental health disorders in this time.","Jing Ma; Jun Ding; Jiawen Hu; Kai Wang; Shuaijun Xiao; Ting Luo; Shuxiang Yu; Chuntao Liu; Yubxuan Xu; Yingxian Liu; Changhong Wang; Suqin Guo; Xiaohua Yang; Haidong Song; Yaoguo Geng; Yu Jin; Huayun Chen; Chunyu Liu","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.27.21262700","20210829","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-30","",17512,""
"Child and caregiver mental health during COVID-19","There are urgent calls for research into the mental health consequences of living through the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe caregiver and child mental health over 12 months using Australia's only nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional survey of caregivers with children (0-17 years). N=2020 caregivers in June 2020, N=1434 in September 2020, and N=2508 in July 2021 provided data. Caregivers rated their mental health (Kessler-6), and impacts of the pandemic on their own and their children's mental health. Data were weighted using national distribution of age, gender, number of children, state/territory and neighbourhood-level disadvantage. Mental health measures worsened over time. There was an unequal distribution of impacts based on caregiver gender, child age and family socioeconomic characteristics. Negative impacts were more common with current or cumulative lockdown. The indirect impacts of COVID-19 are real and concerning. Mental health must be central to the immediate and ongoing pandemic responses for families and children.","Anna Price; Mary-Anne Measey; Monsurul Hoq; Anthea Rhodes; Sharon Goldfeld","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.08.26.21262708","20210829","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-30","",17513,""
