"Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Working Adults in the Czech Republic: Analysis of Self-Report Psychological Data in a One Year Perspective","The article presents research evidence on psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economically active Czech population aged 18-64 (<i>n</i> = 1603; 365 men and 1238 women) within a one year perspective. The aim is to describe the differences in the reported mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, and distress) for women and men in the four age groups, two groups with different working statuses (continuation of work/interrupted working status), and between two phases of the epidemic (March to May 2020 and September 2020 to February 2021). The results point to elevated scores of negative mental health indicators (anxiety, depression, and distress) in different subgroups. More negative experiences in a pandemic situation were found, especially in groups of women, people under the age of 35, and among people with interrupted working status. The results also indicate a deterioration of symptoms over time during the epidemic.","KuÃ„Âera, StuchlÃƒÂ­kovÃƒÂ¡, MrhÃƒÂ¡lek","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe11030079","20210925","COVID-19; Czech Republic; mental health; negative indicators; working adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18280,""
"A Bibliometric Review of Research on International Students' Mental Health: Science Mapping of the Literature from 1957 to 2020","The mental health of university students is not only a predominant topic for psychology and education researchers but also a source of interest for policymakers and various stakeholders. Although there has been a lot of research on higher education students' mental health, we have little understanding on the mental health of international students (MHIS). Despite their distinctive characteristics compared to native students, the mental health issues of international students only started receiving attention very recently. So far, the literature on this topic lacks a comprehensive overview of its sub-topic and trending issues. By using bibliometric analysis, this research aims to fulfil this gap and provide a review of the extant literature about MHIS. Specifically, this study aims to (i) draw the growth trajectory and geographic distribution of the literature on MHIS; (ii) identify the documents and authors that have the greatest impact, generally and locally, within the major topic clusters of the literature on MHIS; and (iii) identify the most researched keywords in the literature on MHIS over time. The results have shown that academic documents about international students' mental health are increasing in number and becoming more extensive content-wise. The research's findings provide implications for stakeholders and identifies some prominent research avenues for the future.","Cao, Vuong, Pham, Luong, Ho, Hoang, Do","https://doi.org/10.3390/ejihpe11030056","20210925","COVID-19; bibliometric review; international student; mental health; review; science mapping","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18281,""
"Variables Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vaccine Hesitancy Amongst Patients with Neurological Disorders","Given that the success of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relies on herd immunity, identifying patients at risk for vaccine hesitancy is imperative-particularly for those at high risk for severe COVID-19 (i.e., minorities and patients with neurological disorders). Among patients from a large neuroscience institute in Hawaii, vaccine hesitancy was investigated in relation to over 30 sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities, via a telephone quality improvement survey conducted between 23 January 2021 and 13 February 2021. Vaccine willingness (<i>n</i> = 363) was 81.3%. Univariate analysis identified that the odds of vaccine acceptance reduced for patients who do not regard COVID-19 as a severe illness, are of younger age, have a lower Charlson Comorbidity Index, use illicit drugs, or carry Medicaid insurance. Multivariable logistic regression identified the best predictors of vaccine hesitancy to be: social media use to obtain COVID-19 information, concerns regarding vaccine safety, self-perception of a preexisting medical condition contraindicated with vaccination, not having received the annual influenza vaccine, having some high school education only, being a current smoker, and not having a prior cerebrovascular accident. Unique amongst males, a conservative political view strongly predicted vaccine hesitancy. Specifically for Asians, a higher body mass index, while for Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders (NHPI), a positive depression screen, both reduced the odds of vaccine acceptance. Upon identifying the variables associated with vaccine hesitancy amongst patients with neurological disorders, our clinic is now able to efficiently provide ancillary COVID-19 education to sub-populations at risk for vaccine hesitancy. While our results may be limited to the sub-population of patients with neurological disorders, the findings nonetheless provide valuable insight to understanding vaccine hesitancy.","Ghaffari-Rafi, Teehera, Higashihara, Morden, Goo, Pang, Sutton, Kim, Lew, Luu, Yamashita, Mitchell, Carrazana, Viereck, Liow","https://doi.org/10.3390/idr13030072","20210925","Hawaii; coronavirus disease 2019; demographic; neurological disorders; quality improvement; risk factors; socioeconomic; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18282,""
"Bibliometric analysis of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic","As a global pandemic, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a profound effect on public mental health. Publications related to mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic from December 1, 2019, to November 13, 2020, were extracted from the Web of Science database. Bibliometric indicator analysis was performed using VOSviewer 1.6.15. In total, 1233 documents from 2020 were retrieved, of which 680 were original articles. The United States contributed the largest publication output (285, 23.1%). Huazhong University of Science and Technology published the most articles in this field (35), while Wuhan University received the most citations (1149). The United Kingdom had the strongest collaboration network. Four keyword clusters representing hotspots in this field were identified. In addition to developed countries, countries seriously affected by the COVID-19 pandemic also made significant contributions to mental health research during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focused on various aspects, such as mental health during isolation, mental health in healthcare workers, and public mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, countries should strengthen global cooperation and pay more attention to the mental health of vulnerable groups during pandemics.","Chen, Zhang, Chen, Zhang, Wang, Lu, Zhao","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102846","20210925","Bibliometric; COVID-19; Mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18283,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance","The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern. To compare the number of patients and isolation rate of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria before and after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic using the comprehensive national surveillance data. We utilized comprehensive surveillance data, collected in the Japan Nosocomial Infections Surveillance program, which included a total of 16.7 million samples of 5.9 million tested patients from &gt;1,300 hospitals. We compared the number of patients and isolation rate of five bacteria between 2019 and 2020, including antimicrobial-susceptible and -resistant bacteria of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The number of patients and isolation rate of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus decreased slightly; those of S. pneumoniae and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae decreased by 60%; and those of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae increased. The isolation rate of the remaining bacteria apparently increased, although the number of patients decreased. This was due to a substantial decrease in the total number of tested patients (the denominator of the isolation rate), which was larger than that of the number of patients (the numerator of the isolation rate). Consistent results were obtained when the same data were re-aggregated using the procedure of the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System, demonstrating the general importance of this problem. Surveillance data during the COVID-19 pandemic must be carefully interpreted based on examination of the numerator, denominator and background factors that affect the denominator.","Hirabayashi, Kajihara, Yahara, Shibayama, Sugai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2021.09.011","20210925","COVID-19; WHO-GLASS; antimicrobial resistance; surveillance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18284,""
"","This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in Spain during lockdown and the first wave of the pandemic. A self-report questionnaire that integrated the Spanish version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 items (DASS-21) and the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSS) was designed to gather sociodemographic data and information related to the effects of lockdown on the lives of IBD patients. Twelve IBD units invited their patients to answer the anonymous online survey between the 1st July and the 25th August 2020. Of the 693 survey participants with IBD, 67% were women and the mean age was 43 (SD 12). Sixty-one percent had ulcerative colitis, 36% Crohn's disease and 3% indeterminate colitis. DASS-21 scores indicate that during lockdown the estimated prevalence of depression was 11% [95% CI 8.2-13%], anxiety 20% [95% CI -17-23%] and stress 18% [95% CI 8.2-13%]. Multivariate analysis showed that the perceived high risk of COVID-19 infection because of having IBD and maladaptation to government measures to reduce the spread of disease doubled the risk of anxiety and stress during lockdown.

"A Randomized, Triple-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Crossover Study to Investigate the Efficacy of a Single Dose of AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine on Stress in a Healthy Adult Population","Stress is a complex life occurrence essential for survival and goal achievement but can be damaging in excess. Because of the high prevalence of stress in North America, a safe supplement that effectively reduces stress is in demand. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine on whole-scalp and frontal alpha power, midline theta power, and salivary cortisol in healthy, moderately stressed adults. This was a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study that consisted of two study periods with a 7-day washout. A single dose of AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine (200Ã‚Â mg) or placebo was administered. To induce stress, a mental arithmetic test (MAT) was administered before and after the dose. Electroencephalogram, salivary cortisol, blood pressure, heart rate, self-reported stress, adverse events, clinical chemistry, and hematology were assessed to evaluate efficacy and safety. Increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and self-reported stress and state anxiety indicated that participants experienced stress during the MAT. AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine led to a greater increase in frontal region and whole-scalp alpha power 3Ã‚Â h post-dose compared to placebo (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.050). Within groups, there were increases in alpha power, at 3Ã‚Â h with AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine, over the whole recording and during the eyes-open portions (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.048) of the alpha task. The changes in alpha wave activity are supported by greater decreases in salivary cortisol 1 h post-dose (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) with AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine compared to placebo. This study was conducted during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, which has had a rapid and significant effect on both physical and mental health around the world. A single dose of AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine significantly increased frontal region alpha power compared to placebo in response to an acute stress challenge. These changes are indicative of relaxation in the brain and suggest a calming response. AlphaWave<sup>Ã‚Â®</sup> L-Theanine was found to be safe and well tolerated by participants.

"""Halfway Independent"": Experiences of Formerly Homeless Adults Living in Permanent Supportive Housing","Permanent supportive housing (PSH), which combines affordable public housing with social services, has become the dominant model in the U.S. for providing housing to formerly homeless people. PSH has been effective in reducing re-entry to homelessness, yet has shown limited evidence of improving formerly homeless individuals' mental health and quality of life. This study aimed to understand the lived experiences of formerly homeless adults' adjustment to tenancy in PSH, with a focus on how living in PSH has affected their meaningful activity and social engagement. Based on a phenomenological approach, a thematic analysis was conducted using semi-structured interviews with 17 individuals living in three PSH buildings in New York City. Results suggested that PSH was beneficial in fulfilling formerly homeless individual's basic needs and facilitating lifestyle improvements, yet many were dissatisfied with their living conditions and lacked meaningful activity, social integration, and community belongingness. These issues were found to develop in part as a result of formerly homeless individuals' disharmonious relationships within the social context of PSH, consisting of staff members, other residents, and people in the surrounding community. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and implications for PSH social services are discussed. This article is protected by copyright.

"Development of the parental attitude scale-protecting children during COVID-19 and the relationship between parental attitudes and fear of COVID-19","During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents and children have experienced stress and fear, and the attitudes of parents toward COVID-19 need to be explored. This study aimed to develop the Parental Attitude Scale-Protecting Children during COVID-19 (PAS-CV19S) and assess its psychometric properties. This study also aimed to determine the relationship between parental attitudes about COVID-19 and fear of COVID-19. In this methodological and correlational study, parents of children ages 6 to 18Ã‚Â years old were included (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 402). The PAS-CV19S was developed for this study. The study collected data using an online sociodemographic form, a fear of COVID-19 scale, and the PAS-CV19S. The Cronbach alpha coefficient, confirmatory factor analysis, and explanatory factor analysis were used to assess the validity and reliability of PAS-CV19S. Pearson correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 scale and the PAS-CV19S. The PAS-CV19S is a valid and reliable scale consisting of three factors (general health, mental health, and preventive behaviors) as subdimensions. The Cronbach alpha of the PAS-CV19S overall was 0.90; the Cronbach alphas for the general health, mental health, and preventive behaviors subdimensions were 0.78, 0.80, and 0.92, respectively. There was a significant negative correlation between fear of COVID-19 and the mental health subdimension. This study sheds light on parental attitudes about protecting their children from COVID-19. The fear of COVID-19 of parents did not affect attitudes other than mental health. Parental concerns and attitudes about COVID-19 need to be discussed to protect children.","GerÃƒÂ§eker, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, Ãƒâ€“zdemir, BektaÃ…Å¸","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedn.2021.09.007","20210925","Attitudes; COVID-19; Children; Fear; Parent","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18288,""

"Psychiatric emergency admissions during and after COVID-19 lockdown: short-term impact and long-term implications on mental health","The 'lockdown' measures, adopted to restrict population movements in order to help curb the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, contributed to a global mental health crisis. Although several studies have extensively examined the impact of lockdown measures on the psychological well-being of the general population, little is known about long-term implications. This study aimed to identify changes in psychiatric emergency department (ED) admissions between two 8-week periods: during and immediately after lifting the lockdown. Socio-demographic and clinical information on 1477 psychiatric ED consultations at the University Hospital of Geneva (HUG) were retrospectively analyzed. When grouped according to admission dates, contrary to what we expected, the post-lockdown group presented with more severe clinical conditions (as measured using an urgency degree index) compared to their lockdown counterparts. Notably, after the lockdown had been lifted we observed a statistically significant increase in suicidal behavior and psychomotor agitation and a decrease in behavior disorder diagnoses. Furthermore, more migrants arrived at the HUG ED after the lockdown measures had been lifted. Logistic regression analysis identified diagnoses of suicidal behavior, behavioral disorders, psychomotor agitation, migrant status, involuntary admission, and private resident discharge as predictors of post-lockdown admissions. Collectively, these findings can have implications concerning the prioritization of mental health care facilities and access for patients at risk of psychopathological decompensation in time of confinement policies, but above all, provide a foundation for future studies focusing on the long-term impact of the pandemic and its associated sanitary measures on mental health.

"Associations of childhood unintentional injuries with maternal emotional status during COVID-19","To explore the characteristics of unintentional childhood-injury during the COVID-19 pandemic and assess the association of unintentional-injury with maternal emotional status. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a convenience sample of 1300 children under 12-years-old from 21 schools (including nurseries/ kindergartens/ primary schools) in Wuhan and Shanghai during March to April 2020, and the mothers completed questionnaires online. Self-rating Depression/Anxiety Scales were used to evaluate maternal emotional status, questions on child unintentional-injury were based on the International-Statistical-Classification-of-Diseases-and-Related-Health-Problems-version-10 (ICD-10), and a total of 11 kinds of unintentional injuries were inquired. Information on socio-demographic and family-background factors was also collected. The children of 0-4, 5-9, and 10-12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years accounted for 29.2, 55.2 and 15.6%, respectively, the unintentional-injury rates were 10.29, 4.18 and 3.45%, respectively (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), and boys had higher rates than girls. The three leading causes included ""being struck by/against"", falls and animal bites (traffic-injury accounted for a small proportion). Lower maternal educational, living in suburban/rural (vs. urban) areas, grandparents (vs. mothers) being main caregivers, more child exposure to secondhand smoke, close relatives being suspected/ confirmed COVID-19 cases were associated with a higher risk of child unintentional-injury. After adjusting for related confounders, higher maternal depression levels were associated with a higher risk of unintentional injury. The characteristics of unintentional childhood injury were different from those in non-pandemic periods. The main causes, risk factors and the association of unintentional injury with maternal depression deserve attention for development of effective measures for preventing children from unintentional injury during COVID-19 pandemic.","Guo, Hua, Xu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12887-021-02846-2","20210925","Accidents; COVID-19; Child; Family characteristics; Maternal emotions; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-26","",18291,""
