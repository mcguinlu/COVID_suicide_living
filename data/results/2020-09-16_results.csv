"Macroeconomic Policy to Aid Recovery after Social Distancing for COVID-19","Abstract Using the Keynesian model set out in McDonald (2020), in which downward wage rigidity is supported by worker loss aversion with respect to wages, this article shows that a period of social distancing (SD) can leave a post-SD economy with both stimulatory and depressive effects  A loss of productive capacity is stimulating  Costs of restarting firms, lower labour productivity when restarted and a desire to restore wealth from debt incurred during the period of SD are depressive  If, as seems highly probable, the net effect on economic activity is negative then a fiscal expansion can restore activity  To avoid an increased government budget deficit, this expansion would probably require an increased tax rate  Reductions in real wages may also be necessary  A desire to balance the government budget combined with no increase in the tax rate would be unfortunate, because it would cause a further contraction in activity from its post-SD level","","https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8462.12387","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Australian Economic Review;53(3):415-428, 2020.; Publication details: Australian Economic Review;53(3):415-428, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-16","",4828,""
"COVID-19 and Music Therapistsâ€™ Employment, Service Delivery, Perceived Stress, and Hope: A Descriptive Study","In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, which impacted music therapists in terms of employment, service delivery, and mental health  However, the extent of changes within the profession was unknown  The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of the pandemic on the employment, service delivery, stress, and hope of music therapy professionals in the United States  Music therapists (N = 1,196) responded to a 51-item survey including questions related to employment and service delivery  The study also included the Adult Hope Scale and the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10)  Results indicated that many music therapists experienced changes in their positions, including a decrease in client contact hours and an increase in using alternative services, such as telehealth  Changes in service hours and delivery were higher for individuals who worked in private practice than for other settings  Primary respondent concerns included being a carrier of COVID-19, being isolated from loved ones, and income loss  Compared with prior general population samples from the United States, respondents reported higher levels of hope, with a majority of respondents also reporting a high level of hope for the profession  Respondents also indicated a moderate level of perceived stress on the PSS-10  Open response comments provided additional insights into the situational stressors and feelings of hope at this time in the pandemic  The results of this study indicate that music therapists adapted to service delivery changes and continued to provide services to clients, despite the many difficulties faced during the pandemic","","https://doi.org/10.1093/mtp/miaa018","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Music Therapy Perspectives;2020.; Publication details: Music Therapy Perspectives;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-16","",4829,""

"Nurses endured high risks of psychological problems under the epidemic of COVID-19 in a longitudinal study in Wuhan China","BACKGROUND Health care workers, especially frontline nurses, faced great challenges during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak  AIMS To assess the magnitude of the psychological status and associated risk factors among nurses in the pandemic center in Wuhan, China  METHODS In this study, we enrolled nurses from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University  The questionnaire was designed to obtain basic information of the participants, and included four psychological assessment scales  We issued the questionnaires at two different points of time  We conducted the first survey on January 29 to February 2 (outbreak period) with 709 eligible responses, and the second survey on February 26 to February 28 (stable period) with 621 eligible responses  The nurses from Wuchang Fangcang shelter hospital were also enrolled in the second survey  RESULTS During the pandemic, over one-third of nurses suffered from depression, anxiety, and insomnia  In the outbreak period, the nurses showed significantly higher risks for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms than those in the stable period (P &lt; 0 01)  Notably, the nurses from the Fangcang shelter hospitals were more likely to present psychological problems than those from other frontline or non-frontline (all P &lt; 0 001) units, especially for insomnia (38 3% with severe insomnia)  The nurses from the frontline, with worse physical condition and uncertain concerns about this pandemic as compared to the others, were more likely to bear psychological problems  Thus, online psychological information and sufficient protection conditions were effective interventions to help mitigate psychological distress  The nurses from Fangcang shelter hospitals suffered a significantly higher risk of psychological problems than those from other units  CONCLUSION The psychological status of nurses needs more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for those who fought in the frontline during the peak of the outbreak","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.09.007","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Psychiatric Research;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-16","",4833,""
"Psychological Inflexibility and Intolerance of Uncertainty Moderate the Relationship Between Social Isolation and Mental Health Outcomes During COVID-19","The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on human activity worldwide, in part due to many governments issuing stay-at-home orders and limiting the types of social interactions in which citizens can engage  Previous research has shown that social isolation can contribute to psychological distress  The impact of increased social isolation on mental health functioning during the COVID-19 crisis, as well as potential mechanisms to buffer this impact, have yet to be investigated  The current study explored the moderating role of psychological flexibility and related constructs on the relationships between social isolation and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic  Cross-sectional data from 278 participants, the majority residing in the United States, were collected during a 3-week period from mid-April to early May, 2020 via online survey  A series of hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated statistically significant relationships between social isolation and psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and stress), well-being, and valued living  Psychological inflexibility, intolerance of uncertainty, and emotional suppression significantly moderated these relationships in a number of instances  Greater psychological flexibility and acceptance of difficult experiences appeared to act as a buffer against the negative effects of increased social isolation, while amplifying the benefits of social connectedness  Implications for promoting mental health and buffering against the harmful effects of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond are discussed","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcbs.2020.09.005","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-16","",4834,""
"Social (Un)distancing: Teammate Interactions, Athletic Identity, and Mental Health of Student-Athletes During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Purpose Physical distancing measures to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus have presented challenges for the mental health and well-being of college students  As campus activities ceased, student-athletes abruptly became isolated from teammates and were no longer able to participate in sport activities that are often central to their identity as an athlete  However, student-athletes who have supportive social connections with teammates during this pandemic may maintain their athletic identity to a greater extent and report better mental health  The present study examined how student-athletesâ€™ mental health was associated with teammate social support, connectedness, and changes to athletic identity from before to during COVID-19  Method A sample of 234 student-athletes completed surveys before COVID-19 physical distancing (February 2020), with 135 (63% female) participating in a follow-up in the month following school closures (April 2020)  Path models estimated the effects of teammate social support and connectedness (during COVID-19), as well as changes in athletic identity on indices of mental health  Results Considering all path models tested, student-athletes who received more social support and reported more connectedness with teammates reported less dissolution of their athletic identity andâ€”in most modelsâ€”reported better mental health and well-being  Indirect effects indicated that student-athletesâ€™ change in athletic identity mediated the effects of teammate social support on psychological well-being and depression symptoms  Conclusions In addition to advancing theory on how small groups relate to mental health, these findings demonstrate the value in remaining socially connected with peers and maintaining role identities during the COVID-19 pandemic","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2020.08.001","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Adolescent Health;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-16","",4835,""

"Words Matter: Political and gender analysis of speeches made by heads of government during the COVID-19 pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on political leadership and decision-making around the world. Differences in how leaders address the pandemic through public messages have practical implications for building trust and an effective response within a country. Methods: We analyzed the public statements and speeches made by 20 heads of government around the world (Bangladesh, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Dominican Republic, Finland, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Russia, South Africa, Scotland, Sint Maarten, United Kingdom, United States, Taiwan) to highlight the differences between men and women leaders in discussing COVID-19 and pandemic response. We used a deductive analytical approach, coding speeches for specific themes based on language used and content discussed. Findings: Five primary themes emerged across a total of 122 speeches on COVID-19 made by heads of government: economics and financial relief, social welfare and vulnerable populations, nationalism, responsibility and paternalism, and emotional appeals. While all leaders described the economic impact of the pandemic, women leaders spoke more frequently about the impact on local or individual scale. Women leaders were also more often found describing a wider range of social welfare services, including addressing to: mental health, substance abuse, and domestic violence. Both men and women from lower-resource settings described detailed financial relief and social welfare support that would impact the majority of their citizen population. While 17 of the 20 leaders used war metaphors to describe the COVID-19 virus and response, men largely used these with greater volume and frequency. Conclusion: While this analysis does not attempt to answer whether men or women are more effective leaders in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, it does provide insight into the rhetorical tools and types of language used by different leaders during a national and international crisis. This language is important because it influences how leaders inspire citizens to adhere to the social contract, and the priorities they highlight and the words they use are meant to resonate with the rest of the nation.","Sara Dada; Henry C Ashworth; Marlene Joannie Bewa; Roopa Dhatt; Carmen Valenzuela; Raul Santana; Maria M.

"Cognitive Reappraisal and Self-Compassion as Emotion Regulation Strategies for Parents during the COVID-19 Pandemic: An online intervention RCT","Objective: Parenting during pandemic restrictions places extreme demands on everyday family life leading to increased individual stress levels for parents and distressed parent-child interactions. The goal of this RCT study was to investigate whether cognitive reappraisal and self-compassion are helpful emotion regulation (ER) strategies to reduce individual and parental stress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: An online intervention for parents was developed focusing on application of ER strategies on the pandemic requirements of families. N = 265 participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: cognitive reappraisal (CR; n = 88), self-compassion (SC; n = 90) or wait-list control (WLC; n = 87) group. Interventions included two video sessions (day 1 and booster at day 3) and three email reminders to transfer application of ER strategies in daily family life (days 2, 4, 5) supporting daily practice. Parentsâ€™ perceived individual stress and parental stress were assessed at baseline (T0), at T1 prior to the booster session (3 days after baseline), and at T2 (7 days after baseline). Results: Significant decreases from T0 to T2 emerged for both primary stress outcomes in both intervention groups. Moreover, individual stress significantly decreased in CR compared to WLC at T2. No time x group interactions for parental stress were found. However, mediation analyses suggested that parental stress was indirectly decreased by reductions in individual stress for CR compared to WLC at both time points. Conclusions: COVID-19 will not be the last pandemic affecting everyday family life. Cognitive reappraisal as brief online intervention can ease acute stress and strengthen mental health of parents in acute crises.","Hanna Preuss et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46152-A04-9DF","20200916","PsyArXiv|Psychiatry; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology|Intervention Research; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; online intervention; self-compassion; randomized controlled trial; pandemic; emotion regulation; cognitive reappraisal; rct; stress; covid-19; parental stress; corona virus","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-16","",4838,""
