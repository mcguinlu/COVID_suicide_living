"The Effect of WeChat on Parental Care Burden, Anxiety, and Depression in Children after CHD Surgery during COVID-19 Pandemic","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’This study aimed to explore the effect of applying WeChat in the follow-up and health education of children after congenital heart disease (CHD) surgery during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Data from 135 children were retrospectively analyzed. The care burden, anxiety, depression, and satisfaction of the parents of patients at home were analyzed and compared. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’One month after discharge, the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire-18 scores of the WeChat follow-up group were significantly better than those of the outpatient follow-up group (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Compared with the discharge time, the SAS, SDS, and ZBI scores were significantly improved in the WeChat follow-up group but not in the outpatient follow-up group (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05). Ã¢â‚¬Æ’During the COVID-19 epidemic, the application of WeChat to the follow-up management of children after CHD surgery can effectively reduce care burden and relieve anxiety and depression in parents at home. It can also improve the satisfaction of parents with medical treatment.","Zhang, Liu, Xie, Cao, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0041-1733850","20210818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17216,""
"The role of mothers' self-compassion on mother-infant bonding during the COVID-19 pandemic: A longitudinal study exploring the mediating role of mindful parenting and parenting stress in the postpartum period","The current COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging time for postpartum mothers, and associated challenges may have a negative impact on their parenting and, consequently, on mother-infant bonding. This study aimed to longitudinally explore whether mothers' self-compassion was associated with mother-infant bonding and whether this relationship was mediated by mindful parenting and parenting stress. A total of 125 Portuguese mothers of infants aged between 0 and 12 months completed an online survey at two assessment points during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (T1: April-May 2020; T2: June-July 2020). The survey included several questionnaires assessing sociodemographic, clinical, and COVID-19 information; self-compassion; mindful parenting; parenting stress; and mother-infant bonding. Mothers presented significantly higher levels of self-compassion, less impaired mother-infant bonding, and lower levels of depressive symptoms at T2 than T1. Higher levels of self-compassion at T1 predicted less impaired mother-infant bonding at T2, and this relationship was mediated by higher levels of mindful parenting and lower levels of parenting stress (both assessed at T1). These results highlight the relevance of mothers' self-compassion to establishing mother-infant bonding in the postpartum period, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the important role of mindful parenting and parenting stress in determining this relationship.","Fernandes, Canavarro, Moreira","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21942","20210818","COVID-19; mindful parenting; mother-infant bonding; parenting stress; postpartum period; self-compassion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17217,""
"Factors impacting resilience as a result of exposure to COVID-19: The ecological resilience model","Despite the severe psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, some individuals do not develop high levels of psychological distress and can be termed resilient. Using the ecological resilience model, we examined factors promoting or hindering resilience in the COVID-19 pandemic. Of the 1034 participants (49.9Ã‚Â±16.2 years; females 51.2%) from Italian general population, 70% displayed resilient outcomes and 30% reported moderate-severe anxiety and/or depression. A binary regression model revealed that factors promoting resilience were mostly psychological (e.g., trait resilience, conscientiousness) together with social distancing. Conversely, factors hindering resilience included COVID-19-anxiety, COVID-19-related PTSD symptoms, intolerance of uncertainty, loneliness, living with children, higher education, and living in regions where the virus was starting to spread. In conclusion, the ecological resilience model in the COVID-19 pandemic explained 64% of the variance and identified factors promoting or hindering resilient outcomes. Critically, these findings can inform psychological interventions supporting individuals by strengthening factors associated with resilience.","Panzeri, Bertamini, Butter, Levita, Gibson-Miller, Vidotto, Bentall, Bennett","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256041","20210818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17218,""
"Validation of a direct-to-PCR COVID-19 detection protocol utilizing mechanical homogenization: A model for reducing resources needed for accurate testing","Efficient and effective viral detection methodologies are a critical piece in the global response to COVID-19, with PCR-based nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing serving as the current gold standard. With over 100 million confirmed cases globally, the supply chains supporting these PCR testing efforts are under a tremendous amount of stress, driving the need for innovative and accurate diagnostic solutions. Herein, the utility of a direct-to-PCR method of SARS-CoV-2 detection grounded in mechanical homogenization is examined for reducing resources needed for testing while maintaining a comparable sensitivity to the current gold standard workflow of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab testing. In a head-to-head comparison of 30 patient samples, this initial clinical validation study of the proposed homogenization-based workflow demonstrated significant agreeability with the current extraction-based method utilized while cutting the total resources needed in half.","Morehouse, Samikwa, Proctor, Meleke, Kamdolozi, Ryan, Chaima, Ho, Nash, Nyirenda","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256316","20210818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17219,""
"Delivering mental health care virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic: qualitative evaluation of provider experiences in a scaled context","Virtual care delivery within mental health has increased rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding facilitators and challenges to adoption and perceptions of the quality of virtual care when delivered at scale can inform service planning post-pandemic. We sought to understand consistent facilitators and persistent challenges to adoption of virtual care and perceived impact on quality of care, in an initial pilot phase prior to the pandemic and then during scaled use during the pandemic in the mental health department of an ambulatory care hospital. This study took place at Women's College Hospital, an academic ambulatory hospital located in Toronto, Canada. We utilized a multi-methods approach to collect quantitative data through aggregate utilization data of phone, video and in-person visits prior to and during COVID-19 lockdown measures, and through a provider experience survey administered to mental health providers (n=30). Qualitative data was collected through open-ended questions on provider experience surveys, focus groups (n=4) with mental health providers, and interviews with clinical administrative and implementation hospital staff (n=3). Utilization data demonstrated the slower uptake of video visits at launch and prior to COVID-19 lockdown measures in Ontario (pre-March 2020), and subsequent increased uptake of phone and video visits during COVID-19 lockdown measures (post-March 2020). Mental health providers and clinic staff highlighted barriers and facilitators to adoption of virtual care at the operational, behavioural, cultural and system/policy levels such as required changes in workflows and scheduling, increased provider effort, provider and staff acceptance, and billing codes for physician providers. Much of the described provider experiences focused on perceived impact on quality of mental health care delivery, including perceptions on providing appropriate and patient-centered care, virtual care effectiveness, and equitable access to care for patients. Continued efforts to enhance suggested facilitators, reduce persistent challenges, and address provider concerns about care quality based on these findings can enable a hybrid model of patient-centered and appropriate care to emerge in the future, with options for in-person, video and phone visits being used to meet patient and clinical needs as required.","Budhwani, Fujioka, Chu, Baranek, Pus, Wasserman, Vigod, Martin, Agarwal, Mukerji","https://doi.org/10.2196/30280","20210818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17220,""
"An overview of technologies implemented during the first wave of COVID-19: A scoping review","Technologies have been extensively implemented in the fight against the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). While several reviews were conducted regarding technologies used during COVID-19, they were limited either by focusing on a certain technology or feature, or by technologies that were proposed rather than implemented. This review aims to provide an overview of technologies implemented during the first wave of COVID-19 as reported in the literature. The authors conducted a scoping review following the guidelines of PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Studies were retrieved through searching 8 electronic databases and conducting backward and forward reference list checking. The search terms were chosen based on the target intervention (i.e., technologies) and the target disease (i.e., COVID-19). We included English publications that focused on technologies or digital tools implemented during COVID-19 to provide health-related services regardless of target health conditions, users of technologies, and settings. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of studies and extracted data from the included articles. We then used a narrative approach to synthesize the extracted data. Of 7,374 retrieved studies, 126 were deemed eligible. Telemedicine was the most common type of technologies (85%) implemented in the first wave of COVID-19. The most common mode of telemedicine was synchronous (93.5%). The most common purpose of the technologies was providing consultation (59.5%), followed by following up with patients (35.7%) and monitoring their health status (17.4%). Zoom (17.5%) and WhatsApp (9.5%) were the most common social media and video-conferencing platforms. Both healthcare professionals and health consumers were the most common target users (81.7%). The health condition most frequently targeted by the implemented technologies was COVID-19 (30.2%), followed by any physical health conditions (16.7%) and mental health conditions (10.3%). Technologies were web-based in 84.1% of the included studies. Technologies in the included studies could be used through 11 venues. The most common venue of technologies was mobile applications (68.3%), followed by desktop applications (57.9%), telephone calls (38.9%), and websites (35.7%). Technologies played a crucial role in mitigating the COVID-19 challenges. Our review did not find other technologies that were implemented during the first wave of COVID-19 (e.g., contact-tracing apps, drones, blockchain). Further, technologies in this review were used for other purposes (e.g., drugs and vaccines discovery, social distancing, and immunity passport). Future research on studies about such technologies and purposes is recommended. Further reviews are required to investigate technologies implemented in the following waves of COVID-19.","Abd-Alrazaq, Hassan, Abuelezz, Ahmed, Alzubaidi, Shah, Alhuwail, Giannicchi, Househ","https://doi.org/10.2196/29136","20210818","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17221,""
"Religious Coping Amidst a Pandemic: Impact on COVID-19-Related Anxiety","Religious coping is one potential strategy to manage stressors. Positive religious coping has been linked to better physical and mental health outcomes, while negative religious coping has been associated with increased stress and anxiety. The primary objective of this study was to examine individuals' use of religious coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. We examined the relationship between COVID-19 anxiety and religious coping in a national sample of 970 individuals located within the USA recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) between September 12, 2020, and September 25, 2020. Findings indicate negative religious coping is most strongly associated with COVID-19 anxiety, as higher levels of negative religious coping were positively related to COVID-19 anxiety. In a moderated multiple regression wherein positive religious coping and negative religious coping were included in an interaction term, only negative religious coping was significantly associated with COVID-19 anxiety. This may have been due, in part, because individual's typical religious engagement was disrupted by social distancing and isolation measures. When accounting for participant age, sex, religious beliefs and behaviors, and negative religious coping, positive religious coping was negatively, although weakly, associated with COVID-19 anxiety. These findings suggest that negative religious coping has a stronger association with COVID-19 anxiety than positive religious coping.","DeRossett, LaVoie, Brooks","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10943-021-01385-5","20210818","COVID-19; Health; Religion; Religious coping; USA","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17222,""
"The impact of COVID-19 lockdown on child and adolescent mental health: systematic review","COVID-19 was declared a pandemic in March 2020, resulting in many countries worldwide calling for lockdowns. This study aimed to review the existing literature on the effects of the lockdown measures established as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents. Embase, Ovid, Global Health, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and pre-print databases were searched in this PRISMA-compliant systematic review (PROSPERO: CRD42021225604). We included individual studies reporting on a wide range of mental health outcomes, including risk and protective factors, conducted in children and adolescents (agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°19Ã‚Â years), exposed to COVID-19 lockdown. Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted by independent researchers, and results were synthesised by core themes. 61 articles with 54,999 children and adolescents were included (mean ageÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.3Ã‚Â years, 49.7% female). Anxiety symptoms and depression symptoms were common in the included studies and ranged 1.8-49.5% and 2.2-63.8%, respectively. Irritability (rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°16.7-73.2%) and anger (rangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°30.0-51.3%), were also frequently reported by children and adolescents. Special needs and the presence of mental disorders before the lockdown, alongside excessive media exposure, were significant risk factors for anxiety. Parent-child communication was protective for anxiety and depression. The COVID-19 lockdown has resulted in psychological distress and highlighted vulnerable groups such as those with previous or current mental health difficulties. Supporting the mental health needs of children and adolescents at risk is key. Clinical guidelines to alleviate the negative effects of COVID-19 lockdown and public health strategies to support this population need to be developed.","Panchal, Salazar de Pablo, Franco, Moreno, Parellada, Arango, Fusar-Poli","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-021-01856-w","20210818","Adolescents; COVID-19; Children; Coronavirus; Lockdown; Mental health; Systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17223,""

"Psychosocial perspectives among cancer patients during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis: An observational longitudinal study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis and consequent changes in medical practice have engendered feelings of distress in diverse populations, potentially adversely affecting the psychological well-being of cancer patients. The purpose of this observational longitudinal study was to evaluate psychosocial perspectives among patients with cancer on intravenous treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study recruited 164 cancer patients undergoing intravenous anti-neoplastic therapy in a tertiary cancer center. Psychosocial indices were assessed at two points in time, corresponding with the beginning of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in Israel (March 2020) and the time of easing of restrictions implemented to curtail spread of infection (May 2020). At Time 1 (T1), elevated COVID-19 distress levels (score 1 and 2 on 5-point scale) were observed in 44% of patients, and associated with pre-existing hypertension and lung disease in multivariate analyses but no demographic or cancer related factors. At Time 2 (T2), 10% had elevated anxiety and 24% depression as indicated by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A/D). COVID-19 distress at T1 was related to higher levels of HADS-A at T2 (Spearman 0.33 pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), but not HADS-D. Patients with breast cancer expressed greater COVID-19 distress compared with other cancer types (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01), while both HADS-A and HADS-D were highest for patients with GI cancer. Patient report of loneliness and decreased support from relatives were factors associated with HADS-A (pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â .03 and pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.01, respectively), while HADS-D was not similarly related to the factors evaluated. Patients with cancer undergoing intravenous treatment may be vulnerable to acute adverse psychological ramifications of COVID-19, specifically exhibiting high levels of anxiety. These appear unrelated to patient age or disease stage. Those with underlying comorbidities, breast cancer or reduced social support may be at higher risk.","Turgeman, Goshen-Lago, Waldhorn, Karov, Groisman, Reiner Benaim, Almog, Halberthal, Ben-Aharon","https://doi.org/10.1002/cnr2.1506","20210818","clinical observations; medical oncology; psychosocial studies; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17225,""
"Parents' Self-Reported Psychological Impacts of COVID-19: Associations With Parental Burnout, Child Behavior, and Income","The current study investigates associations between parents' perceived coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) psychological impacts and experiences of parental burnout, children's behaviors, and income. Data were collected during an online survey of parents' (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1000) pandemic experiences in April 2020. Parents (MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°36.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, SD = 6.0; 82.1% White) with at least one child 12Ã¢â‚¬â€°years or younger reported on measures of mental health, perceived COVID-19 impacts, parental burnout, and perceived increases in children's stress and positive behaviors. Path model analyses revealed that parents who perceived increased psychological impacts from COVID-19 reported higher levels of parental burnout, greater increases in children's stress behaviors, and less positive behavior in children. Additionally, there were significant indirect effects of parental burnout on the link between COVID-19 psychological impacts and children's behaviors. Finally, family income moderated associations between psychological impacts and children's stress behaviors, such that the association was stronger for families with lower income. These results suggest parents' perceptions of how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted their mental health has implications for parent and child well-being, with stronger associations for low-income families. Given the potential for spillover effects between parents and children, promoting family well-being through practice and policy initiatives is crucial, including providing financial and caregiving relief for parents, and mental and behavioral health support for families.","Kerr, Fanning, Huynh, Botto, Kim","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab089","20210818","COVID-19 pandemic; child stress; parent psychopathology; parental burnout","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17226,""
"Covariance Between Parent and Child Symptoms Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","COVID-19 has had unprecedented effects on American families, including increases in depression, anxiety, and irritability for both parents and children. While parents and children influence each other's psychological functioning during non-disaster times, this effect may be amplified during times of disaster. The current study investigated how COVID-19 influenced covariance of depressive symptoms and irritability in children and their parents. Three hundred and ninety-one parents and their 8- to 17-year-old children (Mage = 10.68Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, 70% male, 86% White) from a large sample of children and parents, primarily from Southeastern Louisiana, completed self-report measures of depression and irritability approximately 6Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks into the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as providing retrospective reports of their symptoms prior to the pandemic. Actor-partner interdependence models were used to measure the reciprocal effects of parent symptoms on children and vice versa, both before and during the pandemic. Actor effects in both the depressive symptoms and irritability models suggested that pre-COVID-19 depressive symptoms and irritability were robust predictors of early-COVID-19 depressive symptoms and irritability for both parents and children. Partner effects were also detected in the irritability model, in that parental irritability prior to COVID-19 was associated with decreased child irritability during the pandemic. Both before and during the pandemic, associations between parent and child depressive symptoms and irritability scores were weaker in families evidencing greater dysfunction. Results suggest that COVID-19-related stress is associated with increases in both parent and child symptomatology, and that family relationships likely influence associations between these symptoms.","Black, Evans, Aaron, Brabham, Kaplan","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab086","20210818","COVID-19; depression; parenting; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17227,""

"Problem Solving Training for Veterans with Complex Comorbidities: Treatment Delivery Adaptations during COVID-19","To summarize adaptations due to COVID-19 for VA Problem Solving Training (PST) for clinicians serving medically complex patients and to compare patient mental health outcomes in the year before (2019) and during COVID-19 (2020). Clinicians attended a multi-day workshop and up to 6 months of small-group consultation for two training cases. In 2019 and 2020, 122 Veteran patients completed baseline and posttreatment measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item), and negative problem-solving beliefs (Negative Problem Orientation Questionnaire). Qualitative data were collected on clinician's pandemic-related treatment implementation challenges. Program adaptations during COVID-19 addressed challenges due to delivering treatment by telephone, video, or in person; Veteran patient recruitment barriers; and privacy issues for telephone and video. Veterans in both pre-pandemic and COVID-19 cohorts had significant improvements in depression, anxiety, and negative problem-solving beliefs, with no significant differences in the amount of improvement between the two cohorts. Flexibilities afforded to clinicians delivering the PST training program during the pandemic addressed key obstacles and barriers to recruitment, and implementation did not diminish the effectiveness of the intervention. Findings support continued implementation of the PST training program with added flexibility to treatment delivery beyond the pandemic.","Beaudreau, Otero, Walker, Gould, Sisco, White, Pella, Wiley, Voorhees, Wetherell","https://doi.org/10.1080/07317115.2021.1963382","20210818","COVID-19; Veterans; complex medical comorbidity; home-based primary care; nursing home; older adult; problem solving therapy; stress; telecommunications; video","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17229,""
"[COVID-19 and stress-related disorders]","Since the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, the most actual problem has been a change in the lifestyle of the population of Russia and the rest of the world. Fear of illness, self-isolation/quarantine, and decreased quality of life have dramatically increased the level of stress-related disorders in the population. The main mental disorders arising from stress refer to anxiety disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder), obsessive-compulsive disorder, depressions of varying severity and conversion reactions. The symptoms and early warning signs of stress-related disorders may be chronic or episodic. Stress-related disorders are corrected with psychotropic therapy, which aims to restore the balance of neurotransmitters. Current first choice agents for the treatment of both pathological anxiety and depression are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). During the pandemic, the SSRI fluvoxamine is of special interest. Its mechanisms of action are recognized as potentially useful for treating COVID-19 infection. Two studies confirming the efficacy and safety of fluvoxamine in the treatment of coronavirus infection are described.

"Significance and Associated Factors of Long-Term Sequelae in Patients after Acute COVID-19 Infection in Korea","As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has progressed, there has been a growing awareness of the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 infection. However, until recently, there was no published study that investigated COVID-19-related sequelae and related factors for greater than six months from the onset of COVID-19 symptoms or the time of COVID-19 diagnosis in Korea. Online survey and statistical analysis were conducted by Kyungpook National University Hospital on 5,252 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 between February 18, 2020 and March 14, 2020. Responders aged between 16 and 70 years were included. Long-term sequelae were defined as persistent symptoms or signs Ã¢â€°Â¥ 6 months after acute COVID-19 infection. The survey was conducted from September 8, 2020 to September 10, 2020. Clinical characteristics and self-reported clinical sequelae of the responders were analyzed to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with sequelae using descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analysis. The median period from the date of the first symptom onset or COVID-19 diagnosis to the time of the survey was 195 (interquartile range [IQR] 191 - 200) days. The response rate was 17.1% (900 out of 5,252). The median age was 31 (IQR 24.0 - 47.0) years old, and 627 responders were female (69.7%). Regarding the disease severity, 29 (3.2%) were asymptomatic, 763 (84.8%) mild, 86 (9.6%) moderate, 17 (1.9%) severe, and 5 (0.6%) critical. In total, 591 (65.7%) responders suffered from COVID-19-related long-term sequelae and 78 (8.6%) responders were receiving outpatient treatment for COVID-19-related long-term sequelae. The most common symptoms identified during the isolation period were anosmia and ageusia at 44.5% and 43.5%, respectively. Fatigue was the most common long-term sequelae, accounting for 253 (26.2%) responders, followed by concentration difficulty, amnesia, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, and depression, which accounted for over 20%. Female gender was identified as the factor associated with mental and psychological long-term sequelae (<i>P</i> &lt;0.05). The results showed that the rate of COVID-19-related long-term sequelae was 65.7%. The most common long-term sequela was fatigue. The risk factor identified was female gender. It was found that the long-term sequelae had various manifestations, including mental and psychological aspects. To improve the care of COVID-19 recovered patients with COVID-19-related long-term sequelae, the participation of a comprehensive and an interdisciplinary group of researchers is required.","Kim, Kim, Chang, Kwon, Bae, Hwang","https://doi.org/10.3947/ic.2021.0022","20210818","COVID-19; Clinical sequelae; Long-term consequences; SARS-CoV-2; Sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17231,""
"Establishment of a psychological intervention mechanism for healthcare workers facing public health emergencies in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak","The novel coronavirus disease pandemic is an unprecedented challenge globally. Medical personnel have been playing a leading role by fighting at the forefront against the pandemic and are the backbone of the fight against the epidemic. These frontline medical workers are under enormous psychological pressure and are prone to overwork and stress, as well as depression depletion, anxiety, insomnia, frustration, or self-blame in the face of patient deaths. Active psychological crisis interventions for medical staff fighting the pandemic are important protect and promote to maintain their occupational health. Based on China's experience, this paper describes the importance of organizational leadership, emergency psychological crisis interventions in pandemics, and psychological intervention measures for medical staff. It cites useful explorations from different regions and makes suggestions for establishing a sound psychological intervention mechanism.","Zhang, Sun, Wang, Zhu","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.3306","20210818","COVID-19; China; coronavirus; healthcare workers; psychological interventions; public health emergency","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17232,""
"The Association Between History of Depression and Access to Care Among Medicare Beneficiaries During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Depression is associated with a higher risk for experiencing barriers to care, unmet social needs, and poorer economic and mental health outcomes. To determine the impact of COVID-19 on ability to access care, social and economic needs, and mental health among Medicare beneficiaries with and without depression. Cross-sectional study using data from the 2020 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Summer Supplement Public Use File. Access to medical care, inability to access food, medications, household supplies, pay rent or mortgage, feelings of economic security, and mental health effects since COVID-19, risk-adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Participants were 11,080 Medicare beneficiaries (nationally representative of 55,960,783 beneficiaries), 27.0% with and 73.0% without a self-reported history of depression. As compared to those without a history of depression, Medicare beneficiaries with a self-reported history of depression were more likely to report inability to get care because of COVID-19 (aOR = 1.28, 95% CI, 1.09, 1.51; P = 0.003), to get household supplies such as toilet paper (aOR = 1.32, 95% CI, 1.10, 1.58; P = 0.003), and to pay rent or mortgage (aOR = 1.64, 95% CI, 1.07, 2.52; P = 0.02). Medicare beneficiaries with a self-reported history of depression were more likely to report feeling less financially secure (aOR = 1.43, 95% CI, 1.22, 1.68; P &lt; 0.001), more stressed or anxious (aOR = 1.68, 95% CI, 1.49, 1.90; P &lt; 0.001), more lonely or sad (aOR = 1.97, 95% CI, 1.68, 2.31; P &lt; 0.001), and less socially connected (aOR = 1.27, 95% CI, 1.10, 1.47; P = 0.001). A self-reported history of depression was associated with greater inability to access care, more unmet social needs, and poorer economic and mental health outcomes, suggesting greater risk for adverse health outcomes during COVID-19.","Balasuriya, Quinton, Canavan, Holland, Edelman, Druss, Ross","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-021-06990-4","20210818","depression; health services research; prevention; primary care; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17233,""
"Interventions for the well-being of healthcare workers during a pandemic or other crisis: scoping review","The aim of this scoping review was to identify pre-existing interventions to support the well-being of healthcare workers during a pandemic or other crisis and to assess the quality of these interventions. Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage scoping review framework was used to identify the types of evidence available in the field of well-being interventions for healthcare workers during a pandemic. PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL and ERIC databases were searched to find interventions for the well-being of doctors during pandemics. Owing to a lack of results, this search was expanded to all healthcare workers and to include any crisis. Databases were searched in June 2020 and again in October 2020. Articles were included that studied healthcare workers, reported an intervention design and were specifically designed for use during a pandemic or other crisis. Well-being was defined broadly and could include psychological, physical, social or educational interventions. Searching produced 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°529 total academic references of which 2062 were duplicates. This left 8467 references. Of these, 16 met our inclusion criteria and were included in data extraction. During data extraction, three more papers were excluded. This left 13 papers to summarise and report. Of these 13 papers, 6 were prospective studies and 7 were purely descriptive. None of the interventions were theoretically informed in their development and the quality of the evidence was generally deemed poor. There are no high-quality, theory-based interventions for the well-being of healthcare workers during a pandemic or other crisis. Given that previous pandemics have been shown to have a negative effect on healthcare workers well-being, it is imperative this shortcoming is addressed. This scoping review highlights the need for high-quality, theory-based and evidence-based interventions for the well-being of healthcare workers during a pandemic.","Cairns, Aitken, Pope, Cecil, Cunningham, Ferguson, Gibson Smith, Gordon, Johnston, Laidlaw, Scanlan, Tooman, Wakeling, Walker","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047498","20210818","COVID-19; anxiety disorders; health policy; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17234,""

"Experiences of nurses caring for respiratory patients during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: an online survey study","Nurses have been at the forefront of the pandemic response, involved in extensive coordination of services, screening, vaccination and front-line work in respiratory, emergency and intensive care environments. The nature of this work is often intense and stress-provoking with an inevitable psychological impact on nurses and all healthcare workers. This study focused on nurses working in respiratory areas with the aim of identifying and characterising the self-reported issues that exacerbated or alleviated their concerns during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was developed consisting of 90 questions using a mixture of open-ended and closed questions. Participant demographic data were also collected (age, gender, ethnicity, number of years qualified, details of long-term health conditions, geographical location, nursing background/role and home life). The online survey was disseminated via social media and professional respiratory societies (British Thoracic Society, Primary Care Respiratory Society, Association of Respiratory Nurse Specialists) over a 3-week period in May 2020 and the survey closed on 1 June 2020. The study highlights the experiences of nurses caring for respiratory patients during the first wave of the pandemic in early 2020. Concerns were expressed over the working environment, the supply and availability of adequate protective personal equipment, the quality of care individuals were able to deliver, and the impact on mental health to nurses and their families. A high number provided free-text comments around their worries and concerns about the impact on their household; these included bringing the virus home, the effect on family members worrying about them, mental health and the impact of changing working patterns, and managing with children. Although both formal and informal support were available, there were inconsistencies in provision, highlighting the importance of nursing leadership and management in ensuring equity of access to services. Support for staff is essential both throughout the pandemic and afterwards, and it is important that preparation of individuals regarding building resilience is recognised. It is also clear that psychological support and services for nurses and the wider healthcare team need to be available and quickly convened in the event of similar major incidents, either global or local.","Roberts, Kelly, Lippiett, Ray, Welch","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjresp-2021-000987","20210818","COVID-19; Adolescent; Adult; COVID-19; Female; Humans; Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional; Leadership; Male; Middle Aged; Nurses; Occupational Stress; Pandemics; Personal Protective Equipment; Psychosocial Support Systems; Resilience, Psychological; Respiratory Care Units; Self Report; Young Adult","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17236,""
"COVID-19 psychological impact: The role of perfectionism","Psychological reactions to pandemics and their constraints depend heavily on personality. Although perfectionism is consistently associated to depression, anxiety and stress, its role in the pandemics' psychological impact has not been yet empirically studied. Our aim was to analyze the role of perfectionism in psychological distress during the pandemic of COVID-19, testing whether it is mediated by fear of COVID-19 and repetitive negative thinking/RNT. Participants (NÂ =Â 413 adults; 269.2% women) were recruited from September until December 2020, via social networks. They completed self-report validated questionnaires to evaluate perfectionism dimensions (self-critical, rigid and narcissistic perfectionism), fear of COVID-19, RNT and psychological distress (sum of anxiety, depression and stress symptoms). As women had significantly higher levels of self-critical perfectionism, RNT, fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress, gender was controlled in mediation analysis. The three perfectionism dimensions correlated with RNT, fear of COVID-19 and psychological distress. The effect of self-critical perfectionism on psychological distress was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19 and RNT whereas the effect of rigid and narcissistic perfectionism was fully mediated. Perfectionism influences emotional and cognitive responses to the COVID-19 and therefore should be considered both in the prevention and psychological consequences of the pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.111160","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17237,""
"Effect of Covid 19 lockdown on the lifestyle and dietary diversity of women handloom workers","Background Covid-19 lockdown has influenced the lifestyle of handloom women as weaving is the only mean of earnings for them. The nutrition profile of working women is a vital part of their general health as they have more chances of dietary deficiencies; in addition they face various safety related problems at workplace. Working conditions and household responsibilities complicate role conflict leading to stress that in turn affect nutrition and health status. Material and methods Purposive sampling method was used to collect data from 100 samples of women handloom workers between the ages of 30â€“60 years from Kanhirode Weaver's Co-operative Society, Kannur, Kerala, India. Personal interview method was used for data collection. The interview schedule included occupational health profile, anthropometric, physical activity and food frequency assessment. Dietary diversity questionnaire was used to assess the levels and adequacy of dietary diversity. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS) was used to assess psychological well-being among the samples. Results COVID-19 lockdown downgraded the life style of majority (90.7%) of women workers. Majority of samples were with mean age 46.74 Â± 5.73 years and height of 1.52 Â± 0.10 m respectively. Out of 100, 63 samples noticed a weight change from which majority (71.4%) noticed an increase in their body weight. The mean weight before lockdown was 54.100 Â± 7.603 Kg and after lockdown 55.020 Â± 8.013 Kg. The mean BMI before lockdown was 23.232 Â± 2.866 and after lockdown BMI slightly increased to 23.572 Â± 2.928. Lockdown introduced a significant reduction in percentage of consumption of pulses (3.7 Â± 1.2g), fish (4.1 Â± 0.5g), chicken (2.0 Â± 0.6g), meat (1.4 Â± 0.6g) and milk products (4.6 Â± 1.05 ml). Most of the subsamples were not meeting the calories (2063.3 Â± 166.9 Kcal), fat (20.6 Â± 4.3g) and micronutrients such as vitamin A (761.3 Â± 180.3 mg), vitamin C (61.2 Â± 15.9 mg) and calcium (963.3 Â± 183.9 mg) requirements which indicate the incomplete dietary diversity. Conclusion The nutrition profile of women handloom workers was negatively influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cegh.2021.100856","20211001","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-19","",17238,""
