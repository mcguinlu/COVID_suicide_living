"Coping with COVID-19 Stressors: Adverse and Protective Factors Responding to Emotions in a Chinese Sample","Background: The potential roles of affective responses to environmental stressors in individuals' physical and mental health are complex and multi-faceted. This study, then, explores Chinese citizens' emotional responses to COVID-19-related stressors and influence factors which may boost or buffer such effects. Methods: From late March to early June (2020), a cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online questionnaire included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related stressors related to individuals' daily functioning, and the self-assessed impact of protective and adverse internal factors on emotions. Results: 1,662 questionnaires were received from residents in 32 Chinese provinces classified by prevalence level according to COVID-19 infections. Among the 17 positive and negative emotional responses, agglomerative hierarchical clustering revealed four subclassifications: (1) stress relations; (2) missing someone relations; (3) individual relations; and (4) social relations. Additionally, heightened regional prevalence levels positively corresponded to intensity of stress relations. Lowest intensity of social relations was found in the areas surrounding Wuhan and coastal areas. Specially, economic- and work-related stressors as well as negative self-perceptions (e.g., suppression, emotionally unstable, self-denial) implicated in negative emotions. While positive emotions were tied to demographic characteristics (e.g., high education, young age and male) and protective traits (e.g., creativity, sympathy, social responsibility), and inversely linked to relationships- and pandemic-related stressors, etc. Conclusion: Associations were clearly noted among Chinese residents' emotions to specific stressors during pandemic. Providing appropriate psychological resources/supports during future or extended public health crises may help offset the cognitive burden of individuals striving to regain an adequate level of normalcy and emotional well-being.","Rui Xu; Xinfeng Zhang; Danni Liu; Qiang Li; Yanping Wang; Rong Jiao; Ximei Gong; Xueyan Hou; Tao Xu; Xuemei Qing; Kangxing Song; Voyko Kavcic; Shiyan Yan; Ruolei Gu; Terry Stratton; Yang Jiang","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.11.30.21250895","20211130","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22899,""
"The Effect of Governmental Health Measures on Public Behaviour During the COVID-19 Pandemic Outbreak","BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in radical changes in many aspects of life. To deal with this, each country has implemented continuous health measures from the beginning of the outbreak. Discovering how governmental actions impacted public behaviour during the outbreak stage is the purpose of this study. METHODS: This study uses a hybrid large-scale data visualisation method to analyse public behaviour (epidemic concerns, self-protection, and mobility trends), using the data provided by multiple authorities. Meanwhile, a content analysis method is used to qualitatively code the health measures of three countries with severe early epidemic outbreaks from different continents, namely China, Italy, and the United States. Eight dimensions are coded to rate the mobility restrictions implemented in the above countries. RESULTS: (1) Governmental measures did not immediately persuade the public to change their behaviours during the COVID-19 epidemic. Instead, the public behaviour proceeded in a three-phase rule, which is typically witnessed in an epidemic outbreak, namely the wait-and-see phase, the surge phase and the slow-release phase. (2) The strictness of the mobility restrictions of the three countries can be ranked as follows: Hubei Province in China (with an average score of 8.5 out of 10), Lombardy in Italy (7.125), and New York State in the United States (5.375). Strict mobility restrictions are more likely to cause a surge of population outflow from the epidemic area in the short term, whereas the effect of mobility restrictions is positively related to the stringency of policies in the long term. CONCLUSION: The public showed generally lawful behaviour during regional epidemic outbreaks and blockades. Meanwhile public behaviour was deeply affected by the actions of local governments, rather than the global pandemic situation. The contextual differences between the various countries are important factors that influence the effects of the different governments' health measures.","Wang, Guoyan; Li, Li; Wang, Lingfei; Xu, Zhi","https://dx.doi.org/10.34172/ijhpm.2021.131","","Country: IR; IRÃƒ; IRAN; IRAN; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Int J Health Policy Manag;2021 Sep 11.; Publication details: Int J Health Policy Manag;2021 Sep 11.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22900,""

Methods: A descriptive, cross-cutting, and exploratory study of the communication products for COVID-19 prevention published up to 28 February 2021 on official websites of the ministries of health of the 47 countries and territories of LAC. Quantitative and qualitative methods based on the dimensions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) were employed, together with a social determinants of health (SDH) approach. The content analysis technique and investigator triangulation were used to improve internal validity. Results: 3 253 information products were analyzed. In 47 countries and territories in LAC at least one product included a WHO recommendation; and in 46 at least one category or subcategory related to intermediate SDHs was addressed. Regarding structural SDHs, a gender approach was used in at least one product in only four countries, and an indigenous language in only seven countries. In 35 countries, at least one product was found to have erroneous information and in 13 countries the infodemic was not addressed. Conclusions: A substantial number of communication products for COVID-19 prevention were found, but they lacked an adequate diversity approach and comprehensive health approach, and they showed gaps and communication errors.

"Working towards Culturally Responsive Trauma-Informed Care in the Refugee Resettlement Process: Qualitative Inquiry with Refugee-Serving Professionals in the United States","Trauma-informed care (TIC) approaches have gained popularity in various contexts of human services over the past decades. However, relatively little has been explored about how it is applicable and built into services for refugee populations in resettlement programs. This study explores the current status of the application of TIC in refugee-serving agencies and identifies perceived and experienced challenges and opportunities for culturally responsive TIC in the United States. As designed as part of the evaluation of state-wide refugee health promotion programs, this study conducted individual interviews with 78 refugee service providers from five resettlement sites. Despite the burgeoning interest and attempt to embrace TIC, our findings show that there is clear inconsistency and inexperience in TIC adaptation in resettlement programs. This study highlights that TIC that is culturally responsive and relevant to refugee trauma and acculturation experiences is a vital way to address the chasms between refugee-specific programs and mainstream services including mental health care systems. This study also discusses community resources and opportunities to bridge the deep divide and substantial gaps between mental health services and refugee resettlement services and to address comprehensive needs around mental health and wellness in the refugee community.","Im, Hyojin; Swan, Laura E T","https://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bs11110155","","Country: CH; SUÃÃ‡A; SWITZERLAND; SUIZA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Behav Sci (Basel);11(11)2021 Nov 07.; Publication details: Behav Sci (Basel);11(11)2021 Nov 07.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22902,""
"Demographics Associated With Stress, Severe Mental Distress, and Anxiety Symptoms During the COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: Nationwide Cross-sectional Web-Based Survey","BACKGROUND: With the spread of COVID-19, the deterioration of public mental health has become a major global and social problem. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to elucidate the relationship between the 3 mental health problems associated with COVID-19, that is, perceived stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms, and the various demographic factors, including occupation. METHODS: A nationwide web-based questionnaire survey was conducted in Japan from August 4 to 31, 2020. In addition to sociodemographic data, the degrees of perceived stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms associated with COVID-19 were measured. After performing a descriptive statistical analysis, factors related to stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 8203 respondents submitted survey responses, among whom 34.9% (2861/8203) felt intense stress associated with COVID-19, 17.1% (1403/8203) were depressed, and 13.5% (1110/8203) had severe anxiety symptoms. The logistic regression analysis showed that each of the 3 mental health problems were prevalent in females, nonbinary gender, people in their 50s, 60s and older, respondents who visited psychiatrists, and those currently in psychiatric care. Severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms were associated with the number of effective lifestyle coping strategies during the lockdown period. Severe mental distress was only prevalent in teenagers and respondents in their 20s, as students tended to develop stress and severe mental distress. With regard to occupation, working in nursing care and welfare, education and research, and medical and health sectors was associated with stress; however, working in these occupations was not associated with severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms. Unemployment was associated with severe mental distress and anxiety symptoms. All 3 mental health problems were prevalent in part-time workers and those working in entertainment and arts sectors. CONCLUSIONS: Gender, age, occupation, history of psychiatric visits, and stress coping mechanisms were associated with mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their associations with stress, severe mental distress, and anxiety symptoms differed. In addition, the actual state of mental health varied according to the respondents' occupation. It is necessary to consider the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health not only at the individual level but also at the occupational level.","Midorikawa, Haruhiko; Tachikawa, Hirokazu; Taguchi, Takaya; Shiratori, Yuki; Takahashi, Asumi; Takahashi, Sho; Nemoto, Kiyotaka; Arai, Tetsuaki","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/29970","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(11): e29970, 2021 Nov 22.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;7(11): e29970, 2021 Nov 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22903,""
"[VKA overdose in Covid-19 infected patients]; Cas rapportÃ©s de surdosage en anti-vitamines K (AVK) chez des patients infectÃ©s par la Covid-19","During the Covid-19 pandemic, four patients were admitted in a healthcare center. They were treated by vitamin K antagonists (VKA). We observed a substantially increased of their International Normalized Ratio (INR) The mean age of patients was 90 (Â± 8). All had different usual long-term therapy treatments but had fixed doses of VKA to reach a stable INR. No change of background treatment were realized. One patient presented cough whereas the three others were asymptomatic. In the pandemic context, a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 was realized for each patients. RT-PCR were all positives and were associated with a substantially increased INR. Mr H. was admitted with an INR of 2.25 and it increased to 5.93 the day after RT-PCR positivity. The VKA treatment was stopped but the INR one day after was 7.89. Mrs J. presented INR value from 1.96 to 4.58, 10 days later. PCR have been realized and VKA treatment was stopped: INR still increased up to 5.85. The INR of Mr R. increased from 1.82 to 8.05, 24Â h after positive PCR results. Mrs F. presented a gradually increase of INR from 1.5 to 3.36, 72Â h after PCR results three days after VKA discontinuation. Finally, this study suggest a link between the Covid-19 infection and an increased INR. It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 infection induces hypercoagulability in severe forms. Inversely, these four cases show a hemorrhagic risk with the elevation of the INR. It could have a risk of overdose when patients treated with VKA and positive to Covid-19. This raises the question of discontinuing VKA and substituting them with another anticoagulant, or performing INR controls more frequently in the context of Covid-19. Moreover, an unexpected increase of INR could lead to realize a Covid-19 RT-PCR in this pandemic context.","Moine, Marion; Vasse, Marc; Jegaden, Sarah; Boufares, Olfa; Besson, Elodie; Dodille, Svetlana; Jerome, Joelle; Bonan, Brigitte; Ducasse, ValÃ©rie","https://dx.doi.org/10.1684/pnv.2021.0972","","Country: FR; FRANÃ‡A; FRANCE; FRANCIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil;2021 Nov 23.; Publication details: Geriatr Psychol Neuropsychiatr Vieil;2021 Nov 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22904,""
"Association between voriconazole exposure and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score in critically ill patients","Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is essential for voriconazole to ensure optimal drug exposure, mainly in critically ill patients for whom voriconazole demonstrated a large variability. The study aimed at describing factors associated with trough voriconazole concentrations in critically ill patients and evaluating the impact of voriconazole concentrations on adverse effects. A 2-year retrospective multicenter cohort study (NCT04502771) was conducted in six intensive care units. Adult patients who had at least one voriconazole TDM were included. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of voriconazole concentrations, and univariable logistic regression analysis, to study the relationship between voriconazole concentrations and adverse effects. During the 2-year study period, 70 patients were included. Optimal trough voriconazole concentrations were reported in 37 patients (52.8%), subtherapeutic in 20 (28.6%), and supratherapeutic in 13 (18.6%). Adverse effects were reported in six (8.6%) patients. SOFA score was identified as a factor associated with an increase in voriconazole concentration (p = 0.025), mainly in the group of patients who had SOFA score &#8805; 10. Moreover, an increase in voriconazole concentration was shown to be a risk factor for occurrence of adverse effects (p = 0.011). In that respect, critically ill patients who received voriconazole treatment must benefit from a TDM, particularly if they have a SOFA score &#8805; 10. Indeed, identifying patients who are overdosed will help to prevent voriconazole related adverse effects. This result is of utmost importance given the recognized COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis in ICU patients for whom voriconazole is among the recommended first-line treatment.","Bienvenu, Anne-Lise; Pradat, Pierre; Plesa, Alexandra; Leclerc, Vincent; Piriou, Vincent; Fellahi, Jean-Luc; Argaud, Laurent; RimmelÃ©, Thomas; Menotti, Jean; Aubrun, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Richard, Jean-Christophe; Gagnieu, Marie-Claude; Parant, FranÃ§ois; Chidiac, Christian; Leboucher, Gilles; Tod, Michel; Goutelle, Sylvain","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260656","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(11): e0260656, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(11): e0260656, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22905,""
"Barriers and facilitators to the integration of digital technologies in mental health systems: A protocol for a qualitative systematic review","INTRODUCTION: Digital technology has the potential to improve health outcomes and health system performance in fragmented and under-funded mental health systems. Despite this potential, the integration of digital technology tools into mental health systems has been relatively poor. This is a protocol for a synthesis of qualitative evidence that will aim to determine the barriers and facilitators to integrating digital technologies in mental health systems and classify them in contextual domains at individual, organisational and system levels. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The methodological framework for systematic review of qualitative evidence described in Lockwood et al. will be applied to this review. A draft search strategy was developed in collaboration with an experienced senior health research librarian. A systematic search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, Web of Science and Google Scholar, as well as hand searching of reference lists and reviews will identify relevant studies for inclusion. Study selection will be carried out independently by two authors, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. The quality of selected studies will be assessed using JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Qualitative Research. Data will be charted using JBI QUARI Data Extraction Tool for Qualitative Research. Findings will be defined and classified both deductively in a priori conceptual framework and inductively by a thematic analysis. Results will be reported based on the Enhancing transparency in reporting the synthesis of qualitative research. The level of confidence of the findings will be assessed using GRADE-CERQual. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not require ethics approval. The systematic review will inform policy and practices around improving the integration of digital technologies into mental health care systems.","Berardi, Chiara; Hinwood, Madeleine; Smith, Angela; Melia, Adrian; Paolucci, Francesco","https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259995","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: PLoS One;16(11): e0259995, 2021.; Publication details: PLoS One;16(11): e0259995, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22906,""
"Japanese newspaper advertisements for dietary supplements before and after COVID-19: a content analysis","OBJECTIVES: Public health institutions have alerted consumers about advertising for dietary supplements with false claims of preventing or treating COVID-19. We quantitatively and qualitatively examined newspaper advertisements for dietary supplements before and after the COVID-19 spread. DESIGN: Content analysis. PARTICIPANTS: We analysed advertisements for dietary supplements in two major Japanese newspapers in February-July 2019 and February-July 2020. Our analysis covered 2167 advertisements. RESULTS: The number of advertisements for dietary supplements that claimed to be effective in infection prevention (p=0.009) and improving joint (p=0.002) and digestive functions (p=0.002) significantly increased after the spread of COVID-19 compared with before. Dietary supplements that claimed to be effective in preventing infection were advertised in combination with recommendations for gargling and handwashing. Such terms as 'defence' and 'prevent' were used to promote the preventive effect. CONCLUSIONS: False and misleading claims in advertising for dietary supplements may result in consumer harm, such as overdosing and failure to take preventive behaviour. While the pandemic continues, there will be an increasing need for disseminating accessible information about the appropriate use of dietary supplements, consumer education and warnings to manufacturers.","Okuhara, Tsuyoshi; Yokota, Rie; Shirabe, Ritsuko; Iye, Reina; Okada, Hiroko; Kiuchi, Takahiro; Chiba, Tsuyoshi; Akamatsu, Rie","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050898","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(11): e050898, 2021 Nov 23.; Publication details: BMJ Open;11(11): e050898, 2021 Nov 23.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22907,""
"Trust and responsibility in food systems transformation Engaging with Big Food: marriage or mirage?","Concentration of power among transnational 'Big Food' companies has contributed to food systems that are unsustainable, unhealthy and inequitable for people and planet. Given these commercial determinants of health, if 'food systems transformation' is to be authentic-more than a passing narrative-then leveraging Big Food is paramount. To this end, researchers, practitioners and policy-makers are increasingly encouraged to engage with these powerful entities. However, given the conflicts of interest at stake, engagement relies on trust and transparency, that all stakeholders take responsibility for their actions and demonstrate commitment to do no harm. Given Big Food's track record in influencing policy, shifting costs and responsibility for their harms-and while profit primarily drives business decision making-we question whether it is logical to expect trust.This analysis explores concepts of responsibility and trust in relation to food systems transformation involving public-private partnerships. Through short cautionary case studies-looking at the United Nations Food Systems Summit, and Big Food's plastic burden-it argues that unless such companies take responsibility for their cross-cutting effects and earn authentic trust through demonstrably doing no harm, their participation in evidence generation and policy processes should be limited to responding to information requests and adhering to regulation. Any involvement in research agenda-setting or formulating policy solutions introduces conflicts of interest, legitimises corporate irresponsibility and jeopardises scientific integrity. Big Food has dynamism and power to address food system problems, but while it contributes to so many of these problems it should follow-not formulate-transformational evidence, policies and regulations.","Yates, Joe; Gillespie, Stuart; Savona, Natalie; Deeney, Megan; Kadiyala, Suneetha","https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjgh-2021-007350","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMJ Glob Health;6(11)2021 Nov.; Publication details: BMJ Glob Health;6(11)2021 Nov.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22908,""

"Morally Injurious Experiences and Emotions of Health Care Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic Before Vaccine Availability","Importance: Moral injury in health care professionals (HPs) has worsened over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The trauma and burnout associated with moral injury has profound implications for the mental health of HPs. Objective: To explore the potential factors associated with moral injury for HPs who were involved in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, prior to the availability of vaccines. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, HPs were actively recruited to participate in a survey via snowball sampling via email and social media in 2 phases of 5 weeks each: April 24 to May 30, 2020 (phase 1), and October 24 to November 30, 2020 (phase 2). Overall, 1831 respondents answered demographic questions and assessments for moral injury, intrinsic religiosity, and burnout. Of those, 1344 responded to the open-ended questions. Responses to open-ended questions were coded iteratively and thematically analyzed within the framework of moral injury. Exposures: Working in a patient care setting during the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the availability of vaccines. Main Outcomes and Measures: Inductive thematic analysis of open-response survey answers identified dominant emotions and common stressors associated with moral injury. Results: There were 335 individuals (109 [32.6%] aged 35-44 years; 288 [86.0%] women; 294 [87.8%] White) in phase 1 and 1009 individuals (384 [38.1%] aged 35-44 years; 913 [90.5%] women; 945 [93.7%] White) in phase 2. In phase 1, the respondents were predominantly nurses (100 [29.9%]), physicians (78 [23.3%]), advanced practice practitioners (APPs) (70 [20.9%]), and chaplains (55 [16.4%]). In phase 2, the respondents were predominantly nurses (589 [58.4%]), physicians (114 [11.3%]), and APPs (104 [10.3%]). HPs faced numerous stressors, such as fear of contagion, stigmatization, short-staffing, and inadequate personal protective equipment. The emotions experienced were (1) fear in phase 1, then fatigue in phase 2; (2) isolation and alienation; and (3) betrayal. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that HPs experienced moral injury during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moral injury was not only experienced after a single moral dilemma but also from working in morally injurious environments. These experiences can serve as potential starting points for organizations to engender and enhance organizational and individual recovery, team building, and trust. System-level solutions that address shortages in staffing and personal protective equipment are needed to promote HP well-being.","Song, Ye Kyung; Mantri, Sneha; Lawson, Jennifer M; Berger, Elizabeth J; Koenig, Harold G","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.36150","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(11): e2136150, 2021 Nov 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(11): e2136150, 2021 Nov 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22912,""
"Mental Health Outcomes Among Italian Health Care Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: Health care workers (HCWs) exposed to COVID-19 have high rates of mental health issues. However, longitudinal data on the evolution of mental health outcomes in HCWs are lacking. Objective: To evaluate the mental health outcomes among Italian HCWs 14 months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This longitudinal cohort study collected data from March 1 to April 30, 2020 (T1) and from April 1 to May 31, 2021 (T2), from 2856 Italian HCWs aged 18 years or older who responded to an online questionnaire. Participants were also recruited via snowballing, a technique in which someone who receives the invitation to participate forwards it to his or her contacts. Exposures: Frontline vs second-line position, job type, hospitalization for COVID-19, and colleagues or family members affected by COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes are depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, insomnia symptoms, and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSSs). Four different trajectories are described for each condition: resilient, remittent, incident, and persistent. Results: Of the 2856 HCWs, 997 (34.9%) responded to the follow-up assessment (mean [SD] age, 42.92 [10.66] years; 816 [82.0%] female). Depression symptoms (b = -2.88; 95% CI, -4.05 to -1.71), anxiety symptoms (b = -2.01; 95% CI, -3.13 to -0.88), and PTSSs (b = -0.77; 95% CI, -1.13 to -0.42) decreased over time; insomnia symptoms increased (b = 3.05; 95% CI, 1.63-4.47). Serving as a frontline HCW at T1 was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (b = -1.04; 95% CI, -2.01 to -0.07), and hospitalization for COVID-19 was associated with increased depression symptoms (b = 5.96; 95% CI, 2.01-9.91); younger age (b = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.70 to -0.03) and serving as a frontline HCW at T1 (b = -1.04; 95% CI, -1.98 to -0.11) were associated with decreased anxiety symptoms. Male sex was associated with increase in insomnia symptoms (b = 1.46; 95% CI, 0.39-2.53). Serving as a frontline HCW at T1 (b = -0.42; 95% CI, -0.71 to -0.13) and being a physician (b = -0.52; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.24) were associated with a decrease in PTSSs, whereas younger age (b = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.09-0.61) and male sex (b = 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01-0.22) were associated with an increase in PTSSs. Depression trajectories were 629 resilient (65.5%), 181 remittent (18.8%), 58 incident (6.0%), and 92 persistent (9.6%). Anxiety trajectories were 701 resilient (73.3%), 149 remittent (15.6%), 45 incident (4.7%), and 61 persistent (6.4%). Insomnia trajectories were 858 resilient (88.9%), 77 remittent (8.0%), 20 incident (2.1%), and 10 persistent (1.0%). The PTSS trajectories were 363 resilient (38.5%), 267 remittent (28.3%), 86 incident (9.1%), and 226 persistent (24.0%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, relative to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health among HCWs has improved. Factors associated with change in mental health outcomes could help in the design of prevention strategies for HCWs.","Rossi, Rodolfo; Socci, Valentina; Jannini, Tommaso Benedetto; Pacitti, Francesca; Siracusano, Alberto; Rossi, Alessandro; Di Lorenzo, Giorgio","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.36143","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(11): e2136143, 2021 Nov 01.; Publication details: JAMA Netw Open;4(11): e2136143, 2021 Nov 01.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22913,""
"The challenges faced by PharmD students in online learning due to Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on their mental health in the Northern border Region of Saudi Arabia","Objective: The purpose of the survey was to gather information from students on their learning preferences prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, barriers to online education during the pandemic, and the mental and psychological effects of COVID-19 on students. Method: Applying Google Forms, a cross-sectional pharmacy student-targeted online questionnaire designed to develop. In order to ensure that only pharmacy students responded, an introductory opening inquiry of the program name used to select out non-pharmacy students. Following that, these few demographic questions are asked to the participant's present institution and program year in which the participants currently in. Results: A total 260 pharmacy students received the survey, out of total 186 replies were received from professional pharmacy students, resulting in a response rate of around 71.5%. Almost half of the students (94%) chose traditional face-to-face training, while 32.8% preferred a combination of online and face-to-face instruction, and only 16.7% liked online instruction alone. The difficulties to online education during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak show that, Issues with in-person communication (23.7%), pandemic-related anxiety and stress (22%), time management (19.9%), experience in online education (16.7%). The majority of respondents (87%) intended to incorporate online knowledge gained during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak into their teaching/learning techniques. During the COVID-19 epidemic, we discovered that practically all students were plagued by symptoms of sadness, anxiety, tension, and poor sleep quality, with the majority suffering from significant depression (31.2 %). Conclusion: This study concludes that most of the students are in favor of incorporation and applications of online learning experiences in teaching/learning practices garnered during pandemic. Furthermore, the majority of students had changed their behavior as a result of coronavirus, while nearly half of those polled experiencing an increase in anxiety and tension.","Alshammari, A.

"Nature-based tourism enterprise adaptive responses to COVID-19 in South Africa","COVID-19 is forcing a re-orientation of tourism research agendas. Emerging themes relate to ramification, transformation and adaptation. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the research cluster on adaptation by examining tourism business adaptive responses to COVID-19 through the lens of a case study destination in the global South, namely Bushbuckridge in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. The methods implemented were qualitative, using semi-structured interviews. Data was analysed from 20 interviews conducted with enterprise owners or managers in a nature tourism destination which is one of South Africa's tourism-dependent areas and thus most exposed to the negative impacts of COVID-19. The results show that adaptation to the crisis has been challenging because of the financial impacts experienced by these enterprises in the wake of minimal government support. The enterprise adaptive responses included staff reductions and wage cuts, adjustments towards the domestic market through price cutting and changes in marketing as well as adjusted tourism product offerings towards an emerging Black middle class domestic market. Of critical importance is the finding that these adaptive measures cannot replace the revenues formerly generated from the international tourism market. Accordingly, without a change in government policy and the availability of direct government financial support, there is a danger that in the short term the tourism product base will be diminished as many lodges and other tourism businesses are in danger of permanent closure.","Giddy, J.

"COVID-19 pandemic quarantine and social jetlag","Covid-19 pandemic forced the governments to choose the policy to the lockdown the gathering centers, including universities and schools to prevent the rapid spread of the disease, forcing millions of people to stay at home for several weeks and even more. Staying in the home for such long periods is associated with a change in the wake/sleep period (a kind of social jet lag) and the resulting alteration in feeding time and type of food. Moreover, the prevalence of anxiety and depression resulted from the reduction in physical activity and bad news also may help to worsen the social jetlag effect on these parts of society. Possible hazardous changes in this factor are reviewed in this study and some suggestions for better management of this condition are also offered. Pubmed, SCOPUS, WOS, and Google Scholar data banks were searched using the following keyword in combination and/or alone: jetlag, social jetlag, Chronobiology, photoperiod, metabolic disease, cardiovascular, sleep/weak period. Longtime lockdown gathering centers are shown to change the photoperiod cycle in people, and it may induce several consequences, including the effects on cognitive brain function, induce mental illness, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, mitochondrial aging, and cardiovascular diseases. Considering these facts, it is important to make rehabilitation programs for all the societies' members for post-pandemic time.","Sahraei, M.; Meftahi, G.

The region's economy fell into a severe recession from the second half of the 1980s after a stagnation in the late 1970s. Government interventions in the early 1990s (e.g. release of state liabilities of large companies, privatization, commitments in privatization contracts, etc.) did not bring any substantial change, which caused a break in the development path of the region. The output has fallen, unemployment has risen, income conditions, infrastructure and the environment have deteriorated. The authors' decomposition analyses confirm that after the depression of the mid-1990s, first the economic situation of Borsod-AbaÃºj-ZemplÃ©n and then Heves county improved, while that of NÃ³grÃ¡d county stagnated. Following the recovery in the economic output, the public infrastructure investments (e.g. M3 motorway, district heating reconstructions, industrial park infrastructure, etc.) usually started with a two-to-three-year delay. As a result of the economic and monetary policy shiftthat took place after 2010, the region began to catch up socially and economically to the domestic average, but this process was broken by the crisis caused by the corona virus. After a brief theoretical review of the topic, the authors present indicators suitable for quantifying the development process of the region and the change in the composite index formed on the basis of the indicators. They make an attempt to technically forecast the index for 2020-2024, and then the gained results are corrected with data from an expert panel. Based on this, they examine the chances of restoring the development path of Northern Hungary.","Kocziszky, GyÃ¶rgy, Szendi, DÃ³ra","https://doi.org/10.15196/TS610601","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: TeruÂ¨leti Statisztika; 61(6):679-711, 2021.; Publication details: TeruÂ¨leti Statisztika; 61(6):679-711, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22919,""
"A Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities Program for Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Objectives Numerous studies have demonstrated the high risk for burnout and mental illness in medical students. Because of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our medical school transitioned to an all-virtual learning environment from March to June 2020, which raised concerns among student leaders and administrators, as reduced interpersonal attachments have known associations with decreased mental health. In an effort to facilitate student well-being during the pandemic, the Virtual Wellness and Learning Communities (VWLC) program was established. VWLC consisted of hour-long events that offered students the opportunity to engage with their peers online. Methods More than 20 events and workshops were conducted from March to June 2020, including trivia nights, song and guitar performances, sketching, video editing tutorials, chess lessons, yoga, and personal investing tips. An institutional review board-approved survey to assess the efficacy of the VWLC program was sent to medical student participants and nonparticipants. Results The overall response rate of this study was 43% (53/123). The response rate for students who attended a VWLC event was 51% (33/65), and the response rate for students who did not attend a VWLC event was 34% (20/58). Of all of the respondents, 85% (45/53) reported a decreased sense of connectivity with peers because of the pandemic, and 40% (21/53) reported a decrease in their sense of wellness. After attending a VWLC event, 79% (26/33) reported an increased sense of peer connectivity, 61% (20/33) reported improved wellness, and 55% (18/33) believed that these events should continue postpandemic to supplement in-person programming. Those who did not attend a virtual event stated that the main barriers to attending were unfamiliarity with attendees and screen fatigue. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened medical student well-being and sense of community. VWLC programming may be an effective strategy for promoting medical student wellness and community while social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first virtual wellness program for promotion of medical student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic to be described in the literature.","Ahlers, C.

"Effect of COVID-19 pandemic on medical students: A single center study","Introduction: The Covid-19 pandemic caused medical education to shift in unprecedented ways, leading medical schools to adopt virtual platforms and modify student-patient interactions. On top of educational changes, medical students adapted to changes in their support network, finances, and health - both mental and physical. Previous studies have demonstrated the specific effect of online learning on medical students as a result of the pandemic, with as many as 13% experiencing health difficulties and 15% experiencing psychological effects.1 This study explores the holistic impact of the pandemic on medical students at a single US institution. Methods: An anonymous online survey was distributed to medical students at Sidney Kimmel Medical College at Thomas Jefferson University in February 2021. Participants self-reported the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on their medical education, family life, financial burden, mental health, and physical health. Results: 168 out of 1,088 students at Sidney Kimmel Medical College completed the survey with 58% (98/168) of responders identifying as female. The class breakdown was as follows: 38% (63/168) first years, 18% (31/168) second years, 21% (36/168) third years, 20% (34/168) fourth years, 2% (4/168) were considered â€œotherâ€ (including research year, Master's program). 28% of respondents reported developing new mental illness, with second years having the highest incidence at 39%. 42% reported the pandemic affecting a previous mental health condition. 96% of third and fourth years reported Covid-19 affected their clinical rotations. 68% of first years reported their entrance to medical school was severely affected. 13% reported losing a family member due to Covid-19, and 7% reported personal sickness due to Covid-19. 16% reported incurring financial burden due to the pandemic. Conclusion: Covid-19 impacted the well-being of students by affecting their mental health and financial burdens. Educationally, clinical rotations and entrance to medical school were the aspects most affected. In future settings of natural disasters or major disruptions in education, this study provides a starting point for where to focus resources - mental health support, financial support, and educational flexibility..","Poluch, M.; Ries, R.

"Topiramate as the solitary cause of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury","Introduction: Anticonvulsant agents have been associated with drug induced liver injury (DILI). Topiramate, an anticonvulsant agent used to treat seizures disorders and migraine headaches, has been reported as a cause of DILI only when combined with other anticonvulsants. Here we present a unique case of DILI caused solely by Topiramate. Case Description/Methods: A 42-year-old White female with a past medical history of anxiety, depression, migraine headaches, and hypertension presented to the liver clinic for evaluation of elevated liver enzymes. She had been experiencing increasing headaches, fatigue, joint pain, anxiety, and depression after contracting COVID-19. She started topiramate in September 2020 in an attempt to palliate her headaches. In December as part of her workup for continued fatigue, an elevated ALT/ AST of 88 U/L and 40 U/L was noted. Approximately 3 weeks later repeat labs showed an increase in the ALT and AST to 194 U/L and 80 U/L respectively. She was referred to the liver clinic and repeated labs showed ALT/AST of 314 U/L and 184 U/, normal ALK.P, bilirubin, albumin, and INR. She had negative abdominal ultrasound and negative autoimmune and viral serology and genetic disease. Given the temporality of starting topiramate and the elevation of liver enzymes she was counseled on discontinuing topiramate. A liver biopsy was perused and showed compatible findings of drug induced liver injury. The patient returned for follow-up approximately 6 weeks after stopping Topamax and her liver enzymes returned to normal. Discussion: Most cases of DILI involving topiramate are in the setting of concomitant use of antipsychotic medications. Topiramate interferes with the metabolism of the antipsychotic medication leading to hepatotoxicity. This interference is thought to involve inducing the CYP3A4 or inhibiting the CYP 2C19 enzymes. This case shows Topiramate alone may cause DILI. This is noteworthy given the increasing number of prescriptions for CNS agents written, the increasing uses approved by the FDA for topiramate, and the increase in primary care physicians writing these prescriptions. This case shows how treating DILI will require a collaborative effort between the prescribing doctor and the gastroenterologist.","Green, J.; Idriss, R.","https://doi.org/10.14309/01.ajg.0000784908.45557.43","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: American Journal of Gastroenterology; 116(SUPPL):S1181, 2021.; Publication details: American Journal of Gastroenterology; 116(SUPPL):S1181, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22922,""
"A case report of early eosinophilic and ulcerative colitis","Introduction: Eosinophilic colitis (EC) is a rare inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder with a poorly understood pathophysiology. Recent studies suggest that eosinophil-driven breakdown of colonic wall structure may be contributing to both EC and early stages of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We report a case of a young woman with biopsy findings suggestive of both EC and ulcerative colitis (UC) in an early disease state. Case description/methods: An 18 year old female with a history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) for 2 years, obesity (BMI 31), depression, anxiety, migraines and ovarian cysts presents for outpatient colonoscopy for suspected ulcerative colitis after 3 months of diarrhea, vomiting, diffuse abdominal pain, chills and body aches. A CT abdomen showed a 12mm left ovarian cyst and no other discernible pathology. Her medications include bupropion, escitalopram, hydroxyzine, Depo-Provera, dicyclomine, and mesalamine rectal enema. She denies toxic habits and her vital signs were unremarkable. Her CMP, CBC and coagulation panels were also unremarkable, and COVID testing was negative. Her colonoscopy showed diffuse mild inflammation extending from the rectum to the descending colon suggestive of left-sided ulcerative colitis. Biopsies were taken from the right colon, left colon and terminal ileum. Pathology report showed mild active colitis with moderate eosinophilia in the right colon with at least 50 eosinophils per high power field (HPF), with similar findings in the left colon. The eosinophilia extended into the lamina propria with focal epithelial invasion of eosinophils, but no overt distortion of crypts or other signs of chronic colitis were noted. The terminal ileum showed no diagnostic pathology. Overall, the findings suggest a combination of early ulcerative colitis with eosinophilic colitis. Discussion: First described in the mid-19th century, eosinophils are continuously active in mucus and antibody secretion and should populate colonic mucosa in counts no higher than 50 per high power field. In contrast to EC, UC is characterized by mucosal infiltration by neutrophils helped in part by eosinophilic secretion of chemokines. Although our patient demonstrates left-sided colitis, histology did not show characteristic crypt abscesses nor neutrophilic invasion, but rather an eosinophilic predominance with a relatively mild phenotype. In light of current pathophysiologic literature, this may represent an early stage of UC development, or a mixed EC/UC phenotype rarely observed otherwise.

"The impact of covid-19 on the development of a newly integrated gi psychology program in a community-based hospital setting","Introduction: Brain-gut psychotherapies are efficacious, resulting in recognition of integrated GI psychology (GI-PSY) services. However, the COVID-19 (C-19) pandemic changed the healthcare landscape. Aim of this study was to characterize referral patterns and baseline health status during the peak of the C-19 pandemic in a community-based GI-PSY program. Methods: Retrospective analysis of adults who had a baseline assessment for GI-PSY services in a community GI center during the C-19 peak in North Carolina (11/2020-2/2021). Demographics, referring provider specialty (Physician [PN], Advanced Practice Provider [APP]), and self-reported GI symptoms were obtained. Participants completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scale (Range: 0-21;higher scores 5 more severe anxiety), PHQ-9 (Range: 0-27;higher scores 5 more severe depression), PHQ-15 (Range: 0-30;higher scores = greater levels of somatization), and the PROMIS Global-10 (assesses physical (PH) and mental domains (MH) of quality of life via a T-score distribution). Comparison between PN vs APP was examined on these measures. Statistical analyses included: t-test, chi-square, and linear regression models. P-values&lt;0.05 are considered statistically significant. Results: 30 participants (mean age = 38.3Â±16.9: Range: 18-75;60.0% female;80% functional or motility referrals) were included. Referral provider distribution: PN (64%) vs APP (36%). The mean Global-10 MH was statistically significance for APP vs PN referrals: 46.7 vs 35.1, p = 0.02. A significant trend was found for PHQ-15 scores for APP vs PN: 13.9 vs 9.9, p=0.09. No significant differences related to self-reported GI symptoms for PN vs APP in GI-PSY referrals. Linear regression models using health outcomes as the dependent variable controlling for age, sex, and referral provider depicted: GAD-7 (females [P=0.02] and PN (p = 0.05) were associated with greater anxiety;PHQ-9 (PN [P=0.02] for higher levels of depressive symptoms;PHQ-15 (females [P=0.004] and PN [P=0.05] for greater levels of somatic symptoms);MH (PN [P=0.10] for lower quality of life). Conclusion: During the NC C-19 peak, GI-PSY patients referred by PN vs APP differed on baseline psychological status. GI-PSY female patients referred by PNs had more severe anxiety, depression, somatization, and lower levels of MH-related quality of life. Further investigation is warranted to identify factors associated with GI-PSY referral patterns among providers.","Thakur, E.; Moshiree, B.; Jarvis, M.; Baker, J.","https://doi.org/10.14309/01.ajg.0000774600.00947.06","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: American Journal of Gastroenterology; 116(SUPPL):S240-S242, 2021.; Publication details: American Journal of Gastroenterology; 116(SUPPL):S240-S242, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22924,""
"Fear, stress and stigma of COVID-19 among Indian dental practitioners","BACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus pandemic has impacted the lives and well-being of all people around the globe. Dental practitioners are at a high risk of catching infection. This situation has brought risk of death from infection along with unbearable psychological pressure. Therefore, this study was done to assess the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on mental health of dental practitioners. METHODS: A survey was conducted amongst 265 dental practitioners using snowball sampling technique, collecting basic demographic data, practice setting and relevant data. Psychological stress was collected through Covid-19 Peri-traumatic Distress Index (CPDI). General self-efficacy scale (GSE) was used to measure the self-efficacy of dental surgeons. Pearson correlation between the distress levels and self-efficacy scores were calculated. RESULTS: Nearly 3.7% respondent's score was indicative of low distress. 30.18% of the respondents' scores suggested moderate distress, and 65.6% of the respondents' scores were indicating severe distress. Mean self-efficacy was found out to be 22.06 (standard deviation = 4.71). Those with greater self-efficacy scores reported less distress, showing a moderate negative correlation, with a Pearson coefficient of -0.1406, which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study interprets the relationship between factors associated with Covid-19 and elevated psychological distress among dentists. There was a negative correlation between distress and self-efficacy of dentists. Stressors such as greater risk of infection for dentists, lockdown, falling economy and liabilities, social media, lead to anxiety, fear, and strong emotions. Dentists should be provided with broader understanding of mental health and the methods for enhancing the self-efficacy of dentists should be implemented. Professional help can be provided by the government to health workers for their mental well-being. Tele dentistry can be practiced in the pandemic to minimize the risk of infection.","Ruchika, Bagde, Shilpa, Dandekeri","https://doi.org/10.14260/jemds/2021/498","","Database: CAB Abstracts; Publication details: Journal of Evolution of Medical and Dental Sciences; 10(31):2433-2438, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Evolution of Medical and Dental Sciences; 10(31):2433-2438, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22925,""
"Attitude and practices of health care professionals and their family members toward health care professionals dealing with COVID-19 patients in New Delhi, India","BACKGROUND: Coronavirus was noticed in the mid-1930's and the first case of infection in humans was reported as a cold in 1960. In December 2019, clusters of pneumonia cases caused havoc in China. In order to eliminate the infection in the current pandemic, World Health Organisation (WHO) has furnished several recommendations, online courses, and training sessions to increase knowledge, prevention, and control among the health care workers (HCWs). It is crucial to guarantee the safety of not only the health care professionals but also the people who are in close contact with them. We wanted to assess the attitude and safety practices of family members of health care professionals dealing with Covid-19 patients and if the increasing number of cases in India have altered their reaction. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted from July - August 2020 on HCWs dealing with Covid-19 patients and any close contact personnel such as family members of HCWs in order to avoid the spread of Covid-19 among individuals aged 14 - 60 years. RESULTS: A total of 368 respondents participated in the study. Majority of the respondents had a positive attitude. In terms of relation, children had a negative attitude towards having their family member deal with Covid-19 patients (46.2%;N = 46) whereas, 51.5% (N = 35) spouses had a more positive outlook and 49.2% (N = 181) respondents reported that the increasing cases in India had altered their initial reaction. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the participants from our study reported a positive attitude towards a family member working in close contact with a Covid-19 patient.

"Psychological responses of Tunisian general population during COVID-19 pandemic","Introduction: This is the first study assessing the psychological impact on Tunisian general population during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess the prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms and insomnia, as well as associated factors. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey of 1615 people during March 23rd to May 5th, 2020. We used the hospital anxiety and depression scale for anxiety and depression screening, and the insomnia severity index to assess sleep disturbances. Results: Our study revealed a high prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms, and insomnia (70.9%, 71.1% and 60.6% respectively). Multivariable statistics showed that anxiety symptoms were correlated to female gender (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.784, 95% confidence interval (CI 1.252-2.542;p=10Â¯3), history of mental illness (aOR: 1.680, 95% CI: 1.329-2.125;p&lt;10Â¯3), frequently social media exposure (aOR: 1.578, 95%CI: 1.250-1.992;p&lt;10Â¯3), times to focus on COVID-19 = 3hours (aOR: 1.840, 95% CI: 1.433-2.362;p&lt;10Â¯3), consultation with doctor in the clinic in the past 14 days (aOR: 1.821, 95%CI : 1.220-2.718;p=0.003) and recent traumatic event in the past 14 days (aOR: 1.641,95% CI: 1.331-2.024;p&lt;10Â¯3). Principal factors associated with depressive symptoms included female gender (aOR: 1.637, 95% CI: 1.150-2.331;p=0.006), history of mental illness (aOR: 1.498, 95% CI: 1.189-1.888;p=10Â¯3), times to focus on COVID-19 = 3hours (aOR: 1.956, 95% CI: 1.555-2.461;p&lt;10Â¯3), and recent traumatic event in the past 14 days (aOR: 1.558, 95% CI: 1.265-1.919;p&lt;10Â¯3). The main factors correlated to insomnia were younger (age &lt;35years) (aOR: 1.592, 95% CI: 1.17 -2.152;p=0.003), female gender (aOR: 1.864, 95% CI: 1.252-2.775;p=0.002), having organic diseases (aOR: 1.527, 95% CI: 1.131-2.061;p=0.006), history of mental illness (aOR: 1.777, 95% CI: 1.396-2.263;p&lt;10Â¯3), students (aOR: 1.931, 95% CI: 1.495-2.495;p&lt;10Â¯3), times to focus on COVID-19 =3hours (aOR: 1.877, 95% CI: 1.467-2.400;p&lt;10Â¯3) and recent traumatic event (aOR: 1.431, 95% CI: 1.144-1.789;p=0.002).

"Physician Suicide in the Era of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Physician burnout is a common problem among US physicians. Burnout has been associated with absenteeism, mood disorders, and medical errors. Over the last several decades, physician burnout has become more prevalent because of increasing workloads, increasing administrative burden, and time spent on electronic medical records, among several other reasons. The rate of suicidal ideation in physicians is almost twice as high as the general population. In addition, studies on mortality related to suicide show that the rates of suicides in physicians are consistently higher than in the general population. Firearms are the most common suicide method in both groups, while physicians are more likely to use poisoning and blunt force trauma, as physicians who committed suicide were more likely to have benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or antipsychotics detectable in their blood. Unfortunately, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) brought to the surface multiple prevailing issues in the US healthcare system, including physician burnout and the prevalence of suicidality among physicians in the recent past. With this editorial, we plan to discuss the current understanding of the impact on physician suicide in the context of COVID-19.","Laboe, C. W.; Jain, A.; Bodicherla, K.

"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Medical Interns' Education, Training, and Mental Health: A Cross-Sectional Study","Background and objectives The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has challenged healthcare systems worldwide. Various studies have revealed the negative impact of the pandemic on the education and mental health of medical students and residents. In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical interns' educational experience, clinical practice, and mental health. We also engage in a discussion on the compensatory methods that have been adopted to improve medical interns' learning processes during the ongoing pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted at the King Saud University Medical City (KSUMC) in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from March to October 2020. The participants consisted of medical interns. The survey collected information on participants' demographics, training, and the educational and psychological impact of the pandemic. Results The survey was distributed to 480 medical interns, of whom 345 (71.8%) participated. Most of our sample (75.6%) believed that the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their cumulative experience. Regarding the pandemic's impact on training and education, it was found that the emergency department rotation was the most affected rotation (60.3%). The majority of the participants (55.9%) believed that all tracks have received equal education and the volume of patients seen by interns decreased by 91.9%. As for the compensatory methods, 73.3% reported the utilization of remote platforms. Regarding the pandemic's mental health impact, 36% believed that it has affected their mental health, where increased stress levels were noticed in 47.8% of participants. Statistical significance was found in both Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores, which indicated that during the pandemic, 20.6% of the participants suffered from depression, and 13.9% had moderate to severe anxiety. Conclusions This study highlights the negative educational and psychological impact of COVID-19 on medical interns. With emerging infectious diseases on the rise, recognizing the impact of COVID-19 on medical interns is vital to improving interns' educational experiences and mental health during future crises.","AbuDujain, N.

"EEG NEUROFEEDBACK IN THE TREATMENT OF COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTIONS AFTER THE INFECTION OF SARS-CoV-2 AND LONG COVID-19","Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is likely to have long-term mental health effects on individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 can see a range of long-term side effects. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of neurotherapy (EEG neurofeedback and goal-oriented cognitive training) in the treatment of neurocognitive dysfunctions in a patient after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and the long long-term side effects after the contraction of COVID-19. Case study: The 48-year-old woman ZR, an accountant by profession, an employee of the administration of the Municipal Board of Municipal Resources, fell ill on October 13, 2020. The disease began with very severe burning headache, eyeballs pain, muscle aches. Ten days later more symptoms joined: loss of smell (anosmia) and loss of taste (ageusia), hearing disorders, shortness of breath and chest pains. The symptoms were associated with SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection confirmed by an rt-PCR genetic test. Brain MRI with intravenous paramagnetic contrast medium injection did not show either lesions of acute microischemic significance or areas of pathological enhancement after paramagnetic contrast medium administration. The patient was treated at home. In mid-November 2020, about a month after the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and contracting NeuroCOVID-19, neurocognitive impairment developed and after half a year she was deteriorating and not able to live independently in society because of her condition. She called her problem ""brain fog"", and was referred for further diagnosis and therapy to the Reintegration and Training Center of the Polish Neuropsychological Society. We diagnosed a range of long-term side effects and introduced neurotherapy (EEG neurofeedback and goal-oriented cognitive training) in the treatment of neurocognitive dysfunctions. It was found that almost all the long-term side effects were reduced in magnitude. The patient improved and she was able to return to work. Conclusions: EEG neurofeedback and goal-oriented cognitive training might be helpful in the reduction of neurocognitive dysfunctions in patients following the infection of SARS-CoV-2 and long-term side effects after the contraction of COVID-19.","Luckos, M.; Cielebak, K.; Kaminski, P.","https://doi.org/10.5604/01.3001.0015.2464","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Acta Neuropsychologica; 19(3):361-372, 2021.; Publication details: Acta Neuropsychologica; 19(3):361-372, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22930,""
"THE POWER OF SELF-DECEPTION: PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION TO THE COVID-19 THREAT","Background: Poland's inhabitants have often expressed disbelief and negative attitudes toward social isolation, combined with restlessness. This is due to a tendency to discount troubling information while facing the unknown and counter-argue against information that causes discomfort and fear. This tendency helps humans to maintain hope and well-being. The study aimed to determine if Polish citizens tend to downplay or even deny danger when faced with a death threat. Material/Methods: The study comprised 58 adults - 46 females 12 males, aged 21 to 49. The participants were asked to answer 12 questions defining their beliefs and attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic threat and its consequences. The subjects gave answers on the 5-point Likert scale, from ""definitely not"" to ""definitely yes"". Results: The findings of the present study show that a considerable number of the participants tend to exhibit an optimistic bias. This is reflected in their direct statements and in the lack of congruence of their opinions. They do feel the threat of becoming ill but also seem to believe it need not affect them personally. They are also relatively optimistic about the outcomes of the pandemic. At the same time, they realize that COVID-19 may lead to severe psychological, neurological, and mental disorders. Conclusions: The study confirmed a tendency to deny the threat that can pose a severe risk to health and psychological well-being. This is a manifestation of an optimism bias that has its roots in the way the human brain works. The participants did express concerns about the future but at the same time hoped that life after the pandemic would return to normal. It reflects a benevolent facet of self-deception since it makes it possible to cope with highly threatening and impossible to control events.","Kaczmarek, B. L. J.; Gas, Z.

"Stress of COVID-19 and mental health outcomes in Palestine: the mediating role of well-being and resilience","BACKGROUND We tested the association between the stress of COVID-19 and mental distress manifested by anxiety, depression, and stress, and whether well-being and resilience mediate the relationship between the two variables in a population of Palestinian adults. Namely, we hypothesized that stress of COVID-19 will be positively associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and stress);well-being and resilience will be negatively associated with mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and stress);and well-being and resilience will mediate the association between the stress of COVID-19 and mental health problems (anxiety, depression, and stress). PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, the Resilience Scale for Adults, the WHO-5 Well-Being Index, and the COVID-19 Stress Scales were administered to 860 participants via online survey. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to address the study hypothesis. RESULTS Participants recorded a mild level of stress of COVID-19 and high scores for resilience and well-being. A conceptual model depicting COVID-19 stress as a predictor, mental distress as an outcome variable, and resilience and subjective well-being as mediators was confirmed. CONCLUSIONS Palestinians are exposed to mental distress in an environment characterized by ongoing stressors. Conversely, the capability of Palestinians to conserve good levels of wellbeing and resilience protects them from mental distress even in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak. On the other hand, COVID-19 can be considered a new critical event demanding and diminishing the people's resiliency recourses in Palestine. Implications for clinical practice and research are discussed.","Veronese, G.; Mahamid, F.; Bdier, D.; Pancake, R.","https://doi.org/10.5114/hpr.2021.104490","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Health Psychology Report; 9(4):398-410, 2021.; Publication details: Health Psychology Report; 9(4):398-410, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22932,""

METHODS: This was a qualitative phenomenology study was conducted in West Java Province, Indonesia. Total sample was 13 adolescent girls which obtained by purposive sampling technique. The inclusion criteria for this study were high school students from high schools;experienced moderate internet addition as evidenced by the result of the internet addiction test;and able to communicate in Indonesian. Exclusion criteria were participants with communication problem and psychiatric disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. Data were collected through in-depth interviews and analysis was performed using the Colaizzi approach. RESULTS: Five themes were identified in this study: Constant use of the internet due to boredom, bad mood, and curiosity;health issues due to internet use;easily influenced by internet contents;tend to forget learning materials and lazy to learn;and parental supervision. CONCLUSION: Adolescent girls with internet addiction have a complex life as they are easily influenced by what they see on the internet. In addition, these girls also experience various health problems. The results of this study can provide information to the public and health workers about the importance of monitoring the use of the internet among adolescents. Controlling the use of the internet is still necessary for internet use and is good and in accordance with the needs and based on the development of adolescents.","Suryani, S.; Rakhmawati, W.; Widiasih, R.; Kosasih, C.

"Personal protective equipment and nurse self-efficacy due to Coronavirus disease-19 pandemic: A systematic review","BACKGROUND: High number of nurses who infected and died from contracting coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 put them in a difficult situation during the COVID-19. Personal protective equipment (PPE) is the final line of protection for nurses from the risk of healthcare-associated infections, while self-efficacy plays an important role in surviving stressors during the pandemic. AIM: This review aims to analyze factors related to the use of PPE and nurse self-efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A systematic and comprehensive search using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses with six electronic databases was used. Nine cross-sectional, three cohorts and survey, one caseâ€“control, and one surveillance study met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: From 104 articles screened, 16 articles were included in this review. High self-protection was the main factor preventing nurses from contracting COVID-19 infection. Lack of PPE and low cautiousness were the primary factor for nurses of contracting COVID-19. Increased stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and insomnia were associated with nurseâ€™s low self-efficacy. CONCLUSION: The best protection for nurses from COVID-19 exposure is the availability and consistent use of PPE. Moreover, the consideration for designing staff training programs and psychological support was recommended for building nursesâ€™ self-efficacy.","Ayu, N. M.

"Rhaponticum uniflorum and Serratula centauroides Extracts Attenuate Emotional Injury in Acute and Chronic Emotional Stress","In modern life, the use of plant stress-protectors has taken on particular significance due to the wide distribution of neurosis-like and neurotic diseases caused by neuroendocrine-immune system imbalance. Special attention has been paid to the plants containing ecdysteroids, i.e., hormone-like bioactive substances with high adaptogenic activity. The article deals with the study of bioactivity of two plant extracts as Rhaponticum uniflorum (L.) DC. and Serratula centauroides L. with a high content of ecdysteroids and phenolic compounds. The models of acute and chronic emotional stress in white rats were used to estimate the stress-protective activity of R. uniflorum and S. centauroides extracts. Both extracts showed the stress-protective effect via inhibiting the development of signs induced by single and long-term effects of stress factors. In acute stress, the development of Selye's triad signs was less pronounced against the background of the plant remedies introduction. In chronic stress, the extracts prevented the development of anxiety-depressive syndrome. Besides, R. uniflorum and S. centauroides extracts banned the development of stress-induced injuries in the brain cortex and had a neuroprotective effect on ischemia against chronic stress. The stress-protective effects of both plant extracts were based on a decrease of hyperactivation of the central stress-promoting systems (sympathoadrenal, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) due to their GABA-mimetic effects. Peripheral mechanisms were connected with the inhibition of free radical oxidation processes and with an increase in the endogenous antioxidant system activity. Thus, R. uniflorum and S. centauroides extracts have a high potential to increase non-specific body resistance against acute and chronic emotional stress effects.","Shantanova, Larisa N.; Olennikov, Daniil N.; Matkhanov, Irinchey E.; Gulyaev, Sergey M.; Toropova, Anyuta A.; Nikolaeva, Irina G.; Nikolaev, Sergey M.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ph14111186","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals; 14(11):1186, 2021.; Publication details: Pharmaceuticals; 14(11):1186, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22936,""
"Therapeutic Deep Eutectic Systems towards the Treatment of Tuberculosis and Colorectal Cancer: Opportunities and Challenges","What if a new technology based on therapeutic deep eutectic systems would disrupt the current treatment of major economic and socially burden diseases? The classical definition of eutectic systems is that they are the combination of two or more compounds that interact via hydrogen bonds, from which results a melting temperature depression in comparison with that of its individual components. Therapeutic deep eutectic systems are defined as eutectic systems in which at least one of the individual components is an active pharmaceutical ingredient, or a eutectic system in which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is dissolved. Current literature reports on tuberculosis have been mostly based on the most common anti-tuberculosis drugs prescribed. Using eutectic systems based on naturally occurring molecules known for their anti-microbial activity may also present a promising therapeutic strategy able to cope with the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and prevent the appearance of multidrug resistance strains. With regards to colorectal cancer, literature has been unravelling combinations of terpenes with anti-inflammatory drugs that are selectively cytotoxic towards colorectal cancer cells and do not compromise the viability of normal intestinal cells. This technology could contribute to preventing tumor growth and metastasis while providing a patient compliance therapeutics, which will be crucial to the success of overcoming the challenges presented by cancers.","Oliveira, Filipe, Santos, Filipa, Duarte, Ana Rita C.","https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26227022","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Molecules; 26(22):7022, 2021.; Publication details: Molecules; 26(22):7022, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22937,""
"Virtual Reality-Based Therapy Reduces the Disabling Impact of Fibromyalgia Syndrome in Women: Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials","Background: Virtual reality-based therapy (VRBT) is a novel therapeutic approach to be used in women with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS). The aim of our study is to assess the effect of VRBT to reduce the impact of FMS in outcomes such as pain, dynamic balance, aerobic capacity, fatigue, quality of life (QoL), anxiety and depression. Methods: Systematic review with meta-analysis was conducted from a bibliographic search in PubMed, Scopus, PEDro, Web of Science and CINAHL until April 2021 in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compare VRBT versus others to assess the mentioned outcomes in women with FMS. Effect size was calculated with standardized mean difference (SMD) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Results: Eleven RCTs involving 535 women with FMS were included. Using the PEDro scale, the mean methodological quality of the included studies was moderate (6.63 Â± 0.51). Our findings showed an effect of VRBT on the impact of FMS (SMD -0.62, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.31);pain (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.21);dynamic balance (SMD -0.76, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.39);aerobic capacity (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.63);fatigue (SMD -0.58, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.14);QoL (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.3 to 0.81);anxiety (SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.03) and depression (SMD -0.46, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.16). Conclusions: VRBT is an effective therapy that reduces the impact of FMS, pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression and increases dynamic balance, aerobic capacity and quality of life in women with FMS. In addition, VRBT in combination with CTBTE showed a large effect in reducing the impact of FMS and fatigue and increasing QoL in these women.","CortÃ©s-PÃ©rez, Irene, Zagalaz-Anula, Noelia, MarÃ­a del RocÃ­o, Ibancos-Losada, Nieto-EscÃ¡mez, Francisco Antonio, Obrero-GaitÃ¡n, Esteban, Osuna-PÃ©rez, MarÃ­a Catalina","https://doi.org/10.3390/jpm11111167","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 11(11):1167, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Personalized Medicine; 11(11):1167, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22938,""
"Risk of Suicidal Behavior in Children and Adolescents Exposed to Maltreatment: The Mediating Role of Borderline Personality Traits and Recent Stressful Life Events","Childhood maltreatment (CM) is associated with increased non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal behavior (SB), independently of demographic and mental health conditions. Self-Trauma Theory and Linehanâ€™s Biopsychosocial Model might explain the emergence of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) symptoms as mediators of the association between CM and the risk of SB. However, little is known regarding such relationships when the exposure is recent for young persons. Here, we study 187 youths aged 7â€“17, with or without mental disorders. We explore CM experiences (considering the severity and frequency of different forms of neglect and abuse), recent stressful life events (SLEs), some BPD traits (emotion dysregulation, intense anger and impulsivity), and the risk of SB (including NSSI, suicide threat, suicide ideation, suicide plan and suicide attempt). We study the direct and mediating relationships between these variables via a structural equation analysis using the statistical software package EQS. Our findings suggest that youths exposed to more severe/frequent CM have more prominent BPD traits, and are more likely to have experienced recent SLEs. In turn, BPD traits increase the risk of SLEs. However, only emotion dysregulation and recent SLEs were found to be correlated with SB. Therefore, targeted interventions on emotion dysregulation are necessary to prevent NSSI or SB in children and adolescents exposed to CM, as is the minimization of further SLEs.","Marques-Feixa, Laia, Moya-Higueras, Jorge, Romero, Soledad, Santamarina-PÃ©rez, Pilar, Rapado-Castro, Marta, Zorrilla, IÃ±aki, MartÃ­n, MarÃ­a, Anglada, Eulalia, Lobato, MarÃ­a JosÃ©, RamÃ­rez, Maite, Moreno, Nerea, Mayoral, MarÃ­a, MarÃ­n-Vila, MarÃ­a, Arias, BÃ¡rbara, FaÃ±anÃ¡s, Lourdes, Blasco-Fontecilla, Hilario","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10225293","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(22):5293, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Clinical Medicine; 10(22):5293, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22939,""
"Investigating Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing Techniques Applied for Predicting Depression Disorder from Online Support Forums: A Systematic Literature Review","Depression is a common mental health disorder that affects an individualâ€™s moods, thought processes and behaviours negatively, and disrupts oneâ€™s ability to function optimally. In most cases, people with depression try to hide their symptoms and refrain from obtaining professional help due to the stigma related to mental health. The digital footprint we all leave behind, particularly in online support forums, provides a window for clinicians to observe and assess such behaviour in order to make potential mental health diagnoses. Natural language processing (NLP) and Machine learning (ML) techniques are able to bridge the existing gaps in converting language to a machine-understandable format in order to facilitate this. Our objective is to undertake a systematic review of the literature on NLP and ML approaches used for depression identification on Online Support Forums (OSF). A systematic search was performed to identify articles that examined ML and NLP techniques to identify depression disorder from OSF. Articles were selected according to the PRISMA workflow. For the purpose of the review, 29 articles were selected and analysed. From this systematic review, we further analyse which combination of features extracted from NLP and ML techniques are effective and scalable for state-of-the-art Depression Identification. We conclude by addressing some open issues that currently limit real-world implementation of such systems and point to future directions to this end.","Isuri Anuradha Nanomi, Arachchige, Sandanapitchai, Priyadharshany, Weerasinghe, Ruvan","https://doi.org/10.3390/info12110444","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Information; 12(11):444, 2021.; Publication details: Information; 12(11):444, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22940,""
"Smartphone Addiction and Associated Health Outcomes in Adult Populations: A Systematic Review","Background: Smartphones play a critical role in increasing humanâ€“machine interactions, with many advantages. However, the growing popularity of smartphone use has led to smartphone overuse and addiction. This review aims to systematically investigate the impact of smartphone addiction on health outcomes. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to carry out the systematic review. Five electronic databases including Medline, Web of Science, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Scopus were searched to identify eligible studies. Eligible studies were screened against predetermined inclusion criteria and data were extracted according to the review questions. This review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020181404). The quality of the articles was assessed using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: A total of 27 of 2550 articles met the inclusion criteria. All of the studies were cross-sectional and focused on physical, mental, and neurological health outcomes. The majority of the studies focused on mental health outcomes and consistent associations were observed between smartphone addiction and several mental health outcomes. Anxiety and depression were commonly found to mediate mental health problems. A wide range of physical health sequelae was also associated with smartphone addiction. Furthermore, there was an association between smartphone addiction and neurological disorders. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are consistent associations between smartphone addiction and physical and mental health, especially mental health. Social awareness campaigns about smartphone addiction and its impact on physical and mental health are needed. Further studies, especially randomized controlled trials, are warranted to validate the impacts of smartphone addiction.","Zubair Ahmed, Ratan, Parrish, Anne-Maree, Sojib Bin, Zaman, Alotaibi, Mohammad Saud, Hosseinzadeh, Hassan","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212257","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12257, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12257, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22941,""
"Mental Health Provision in UK Secondary Schools","Research reports high levels of mental health problems faced by young people in the UK. Schools provide a range of mental health support services, although these are often not robustly evaluated. This paper aims to explore the mental health provision of secondary schools across two large regions in the North of England and provide comparisons to the mental health questionnaire scores of their pupils. Results are part of a wider study providing an overview of the mental health of secondary school pupils. Measures include the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, distributed to year 8, 9, and 11 pupils attending secondary schools and a bespoke mental health service provision questionnaire for school staff at the same schools. A total of 6328 pupil questionnaires and 36 staff questionnaires were returned from 21 schools. Results showed a non-significant correlation between provision and young peopleâ€™s mental health scores and highlight a range of factors to take into consideration. There is a need to improve the evaluation and recording of school-based mental health provision. Mental health difficulties in young people are prevalent in schools. Future research is needed to elucidate which types of services are most helpful in preventing, supporting, and signposting those with mental health problems.","Garside, Megan, Wright, Barry, Nekooi, Roshanak, Allgar, Victoria","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212222","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12222, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12222, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22942,""
"Occurrence of Professional Burnout and Severity of Depressive Symptoms among Cardiac Nurses: A Cross-Sectional Study","Nurses with depression are not only likely to suffer themselves, but it may have an impact on their coworkers and potentially the quality of care they provide. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and its association with burnout in cardiac nurses. A group of 400 cardiac nurses (361 women and 39 men) was enrolled. The standardized tools such as Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9) were used. A high level of professional burnout regarding emotional exhaustion was observed in 53.3% of nurses, high depersonalization in 52.5%, and low personal accomplishment in 72.8%. PHQ-9 and BDI were shown to correlate significantly and positively with all three MBI subscales (p &lt; 0.05). High depressive symptoms and occupational burnout were correlated with depression (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, nurses were found to have high levels of depression and professional burnout, which may have resulted in a negative impact on the quality of patient care.

"Anxiety, Depression and Quality of Lifeâ€”A Systematic Review of Evidence from Longitudinal Observational Studies","This review aimed to systematically review observational studies investigating the longitudinal association between anxiety, depression and quality of life (QoL). A systematic search of five electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX, NHS EED and EconLit) as well as forward/backward reference searches were conducted to identify observational studies on the longitudinal association between anxiety, depression and QoL. Studies were synthesized narratively. Additionally, a random-effects meta-analysis was performed using studies applying the mental and physical summary scores (MCS, PCS) of the Short Form Health Survey. The review was prospectively registered with PROSPERO and a study protocol was published. n = 47 studies on heterogeneous research questions were included, with sample sizes ranging from n = 28 to 43,093. Narrative synthesis indicated that QoL was reduced before disorder onset, dropped further during the disorder and improved with remission. Before onset and after remission, QoL was lower in comparison to healthy comparisons. n = 8 studies were included in random-effects meta-analyses. The pooled estimates of QoL at follow-up (FU) were of small to large effect sizes and showed that QoL at FU differed by disorder status at baseline as well as by disorder course over time. Disorder course groups differed in their MCS scores at baseline. Effect sizes were generally larger for MCS relative to PCS. The results highlight the relevance of preventive measures and treatment. Future research should consider individual QoL domains, individual anxiety/depressive disorders as well as the course of both over time to allow more differentiated statements in a meta-analysis.","Hohls, Johanna Katharina, KÃ¶nig, Hans-Helmut, Quirke, Eleanor, Hajek, AndrÃ©","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182212022","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12022, 2021.; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 18(22):12022, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22944,""
"Can the Development of Religious and Cultural Tourism Build a Sustainable and Friendly Life and Leisure Environment for the Elderly and Promote Physical and Mental Health?","From the perspective of satisfaction, physical and mental health, and re-travel, this study explored whether the development of religious and cultural tourism could construct a sustainable and friendly life and leisure environment for the elderly to promote physical and mental health. This research adopted a mixed method, collected 700 questionnaires, used SPSS 22.0 statistical software, and analyzed basic statistics, t-test, and PPMCC test. Then, the researchers conducted semi-structured interviews, collected the opinions of six interviewees, and finally analyzed with multiple checks Law discussion. The results found that people of different genders and stakeholders had different opinions about DIY activities on leisure satisfaction, featured itineraries, relaxation areas, signs and instructions, community association and service center services, historical landmarks, and public transportation. They found peopleâ€™s life satisfaction in physical and mental health was increased, their headaches or pressures on the top of their heads were relieved, backache problems were reduced, and they were no longer anxious and lost tempers. They had a greater willingness to revisit some places and share experiences. This study found significant differences among these topics (p &lt; 0.01).

"Development and Psychometric Testing of the Mental Health Scale for Childrearing Fathers","The mental health of fathers influences the development of children and the functioning of families significantly. However, there is no useful scale for the mental health screening of childrearing fathers. This study developed a Mental Health Scale for Childrearing Fathers (MSCF) and determined its reliability and validity. Childrearing fathers are working fathers who co-parent with their spouses. This survey was conducted in two stages: a pilot study and a main survey. Data were obtained from 98 fathers raising preschoolers in the pilot study and 306 fathers in the main survey. The collected data were used to confirm the construct validity, criterion-related validity, convergent validity, and internal consistency reliability. The final MSCF consisted of 25 items comprising four factors: peaceful familial connection, healthy mind and body, satisfying paternal alliances, and leading a meaningful life as a parent. The internal consistency reliability estimated using Cronbachâ€™s alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.918. The validity of the MSCF was logically secured using a confirmatory factor analysis. The MSCF can be an effective tool for mental health screening among fathers in relation to the burden of childrearing during regular infant health checks.","Kondou, Aya, Haku, Mari, Yasui, Toshiyuki","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111587","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1587, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1587, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22946,""

"Mindfulness-Based Interventions for Undergraduate Nursing Students in a University Setting: A Narrative Review","(1) Introduction: Undergraduate (UG) nursing students are vulnerable to stress throughout their education, known to result in burnout, with high attrition rates of up to 33%. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that mindfulness-based interventions are effective for the management of anxiety, depression and wellbeing, thereby reducing stress in healthcare provider populations. The aim of this narrative review was to synthesize and provide a critical overview of the current evidence in relation to mindfulness-based interventions for UG nursing students in a university setting. (2) Methods: A review of the literature was conducted in March 2020 and updated in May 2021, utilising the databases CINAHL, Medline and PsycINFO. (3) Results: Fifteen studies were included in the review, with three common themes identified: (i) the positive impact of mindfulness on holistic wellbeing, (ii) mindfulness-based techniques as a positive coping mechanism within academic and clinical practice, and (iii) approaches to the delivery of mindfulness-based interventions. (4) Conclusions: Mindfulness-based interventions are effective strategies for the management of stress, development of self-awareness and enhanced academic and clinical performance in undergraduate nursing students. No ideal approach to delivery or duration of these interventions was evident from the literature. Best practice in relation to delivery of mindfulness-based interventions for nursing students is recommended for future studies.","McVeigh, Clare, Lindsay, Ace, Ski, Chantal F.; Carswell, Claire, Burton, Stephanie, Rej, Soham, Noble, Helen","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111493","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1493, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1493, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22948,""
"Work Stress, Mental Health and Validation of Professional Stress Scale (PSS) in an Italian-Speaking Teachers Sample","This study aimed validate the Italian version of the Professional Stress Scale (PSS). A questionnaire was translated into Italian and administered to two sample groups. The first group (n = 200) was the control group and the second (n = 1137) the experimental group. The participants in the study were students enrolled in a special needs training teacher course or a specialization course that aims to train support teachers. The study conducted two analyses;factor and reliability analyses. The factor analysis utilized the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test which had a result of 0.925 for the scale;this was above the acceptable value of 0.7. The research studied 33 items and the BTS was significant for the 33 items scale (<U+03C7>2 (528) = 4353.508, p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, five eigenvalues greater than 1 were identified in the data, whereas the total variance explained was 63.7%. The reliability test utilized the Cronbachâ€™s Alpha score (0.936) of the scale and the value is calculated based on the response of 1106 individuals. The value is well above the value of 0.80, which indicates a high internal consistency level of the different items of the scale. This study showed that the Italian version of the PSS is a reliable and valid measure that can be used for research and clinical purposes.","Limone, Pierpaolo, Zefferino, Roberto, Toto, Giusi Antonia, Tomei, Gianfranco","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111434","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1434, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1434, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22949,""
"The Effect of Social Media Use on Depressive Symptoms in Older Adults with Self-Reported Hearing Impairment: An Empirical Study","Older people with hearing impairment are more likely to develop depressive symptoms due to physical disability and loss of social communication. This study investigated the effects of social media on social relations, subjective aging, and depressive symptoms in these older adults based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework. It provides new empirical evidence to support improving the mental health and rebuilding the social relations of older people. A formal questionnaire was designed using the Wenjuanxing platform and distributed online through WeChat;643 valid questionnaires were received from older people with self-reported hearing impairments, and SmartPLS 3.28 was used to analyze the data. The results show that (1) social media significantly impacts the social relations of older people with hearing impairment (social networks, ÃŸ = 0.132, T = 3.444;social support, ÃŸ = 0.129, T = 2.95;social isolation, ÃŸ = 0.107, T = 2.505). (2) For these older people, social isolation has the biggest impact on their psychosocial loss (ÃŸ = 0.456, T = 10.458), followed by the impact of social support (ÃŸ = 0.103, T = 2.014);a hypothesis about social network size was not confirmed (ÃŸ = 0.007, T = 0.182). Both social media (ÃŸ = 0.096, T = 2.249) and social support (ÃŸ = 0.174, T = 4.434) significantly affect the self-efficacy of hearing-impaired older people. (3) Both subjective aging (psychosocial loss, ÃŸ = 0.260, T = 6.036;self-efficacy, ÃŸ = 0.106, T = 3.15) and social isolation (ÃŸ = 0.268, T = 6.307) significantly affect depressive symptoms in older people with hearing impairment. This study expands the theories of social media aging cognition, social support, and social networks and can provide practical contributions to the social media use and mental health of special persons 60 years and older.","Ma, Yiming, Liang, Changyong, Yang, Xuejie, Zhang, Haitao, Zhao, Shuping, Lu, Liyan","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9111403","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1403, 2021.; Publication details: Healthcare; 9(11):1403, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22950,""
"Brazilian Consumersâ€™ Attitudes towards So-Called â€œCell-Based Meatâ€","The main goal of this online survey was to investigate the attitudes of Brazilians towards â€œcell-based meatâ€, which has become the subject of great scientific and media enthusiasm. The answers of 4471 respondents concluded that 46.6% of them thought â€œcell-based meatâ€ was promising and acceptable. More than 66% would be willing to try this novel product compared to 23% who expressed reluctance to do so. Nearly 40% of the total respondents did not want to eat â€œcell-based meatâ€ regularly at all, whereas 29%, 43.2%, and 39.9% were willing to eat it regularly in restaurants, at home, and/or in ready-made meals, respectively. However, the majority of respondents (71%) were keen to pay much less for â€œcell-based meatâ€ than conventionally produced meat (or even nothing at all), compared to 24.3% who were willing to pay the same price as conventional meat, whereas only 4.8% were willing to pay more. Approximately 51% of them considered that â€œcell-based meatâ€ should not be called â€œmeatâ€ for marketing purposes. Job, monthly income, age, and gender were major factors impacting consumer acceptance. Meat professionals and consumers with higher incomes were less willing to eat â€œcell-based meatâ€ regularly. Women (especially younger women) were the most concerned about the ethical and environmental issues related to meat production and were the most convinced that reducing meat consumption could be a good solution to the meat industryâ€™s problems. Respondents who did not accept â€œcell-based meatâ€ and did not eat meat substitutes had a negative attitude to this novel food (they considered it absurd and/or disgusting) and did not believe that â€œcell-based meatâ€ should be called â€œmeatâ€ for marketing purposes. In contrast, the people who thought that â€œcell-based meatâ€ could be called â€œmeatâ€ perceived it in a rather positive way. These results are important for consumers of meat and meat substitutes and for companies aiming to enter the potential future Brazilian market of â€œcell-based meatâ€.","Chriki, Sghaier, Payet, Vincent, SÃ©rgio Bertelli, Pflanzer, Marie-Pierre, Ellies-Oury, Liu, Jingjing, Hocquette, Ã‰lise, Rezende-de-Souza, JonatÃ£ Henrique, Jean-FranÃ§ois, Hocquette","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10112588","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Foods; 10(11):2588, 2021.; Publication details: Foods; 10(11):2588, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22951,""
"How Does the World View Chinaâ€™s Carbon Policy? A Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data","China has recently put forth an ambitious plan to achieve carbon peak around 2030 and carbon neutrality around 2060. However, there are quite a few differences regarding the public views about Chinaâ€™s carbon policy between the Chinese people and the people from other countries, especially concerning the doubt of foreign people about the fidelity of Chinaâ€™s carbon policy goals. Based on Twitter data related to Chinaâ€™s carbon policy topics from 2008 to 2020, this study shows the inter- and intra-annual trends in the count of tweets about Chinaâ€™s carbon policy, conducts sentiment analysis, extracts top frequency words from different attitudes, and analyzes the impact of Chinaâ€™s official Twitter accounts on the global view of Chinaâ€™s carbon policy. Our results show: (1) the global attention to Chinaâ€™s carbon policy gradually rises and occasionally rises suddenly due to important carbon events;(2) the proportion of Twitter users with negative sentiment about Chinaâ€™s carbon policy has increased rapidly and has exceeded the proportion of Twitter users with positive sentiment since 2019;(3) people in developing countries hold more positive or neutral attitudes towards Chinaâ€™s carbon policy, while developed countries hold more negative attitudes;(4) Chinaâ€™s official Twitter accounts serve to improve the global views on Chinaâ€™s carbon policy.","Xiang, Ning, Wang, Limao, Zhong, Shuai, Chen, Zheng, Wang, Bo, Qu, Qiushi","https://doi.org/10.3390/en14227782","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Energies; 14(22):7782, 2021.; Publication details: Energies; 14(22):7782, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22952,""
"Additional Evidence for Neuropsychiatric Manifestations in Mosaic Trisomy 20: A Case Report and Brief Review","Mosaic trisomy 20 is a genetic condition in which three chromosomes 20 are found in some cells. Its clinical phenotype seems to be highly variable, with most features not reported across all individuals and not considered pathognomonic of the condition. Limited and recent evidence indicates that neuropsychiatric manifestations may be more present in the context of trisomy 20 than was once thought. Here, we present a case of a 14-year-old female adolescent of White/Caucasian ethnicity with mosaic trisomy 20, who was admitted twice to an inpatient Child and Adolescent Neuropsychiatry Unit for persisting self-injury and suicidal ideation. A severe and complex neuropsychiatric presentation emerged at the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral levels, including mild neurodevelopmental issues, isolation, socio-relational difficulties, depressed mood, temper outbursts, irritability, low self-esteem, lack of interest, social anxiety, panic attacks, self-cutting, and low-average-range and heterogeneous intelligence quotient profile. Particularly, the patient was considered at high risk of causing harm, mainly to self, and appeared to be only partially responsive to medication, even when polypharmacy was attempted to improve clinical response. Except for school bullying, no other severe environmental risk factors were present in the patientâ€™s history. The patient received a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder.","Colizzi, Marco, Antolini, Giulia, Passarella, Laura, Rizzo, Valentina, Puttini, Elena, Zoccante, Leonardo","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8111030","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Children; 8(11):1030, 2021.; Publication details: Children; 8(11):1030, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22953,""
"Providing Psychological Support to Parents of Childhood Cancer Survivors: â€˜Cascadeâ€™ Intervention Trial Results and Lessons for the Future","Simple SummaryWe assessed a new group-based cognitive behavior therapy videoconferencing program to support parents of childhood cancer survivors. The trial allocated parents to three groups: Cascade, peer-support, waitlist. Cascade achieved good parent engagement. We successfully delivered Cascade to participants who lived &gt;3200 km apart. Any technical difficulties caused only minor disruptions. Most Cascade parents were satisfied and reported experiencing benefits from the program. However, Cascade did not improve our main outcomes, including parentsâ€™ quality of life, depression and anxiety. Cascade parents reported a short-term improvement in their confidence to use the skills they learnt, but this did not translate into actual use. After six months, Cascade parents felt their child survivor had lower psychological health than waitlisted parents. Our findings show that while some parents find Cascade helpful, it may not suit everyone. We used these findings to further improve Cascade and will trial the new version in future.AbstractWe conducted a three-armed trial to assess Cascade, a four-module group videoconferencing cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention for parents of childhood cancer survivors currently aged &lt;18 years. We allocated parents to Cascade, an attention control (peer-support group), or a waitlist. The primary outcome was parentsâ€™ health-related quality of life (PedsQL-Family Impact/EQ-5D-5L) six months post-intervention. Parents also reported their anxiety/depression, parenting self-agency, fear of recurrence, health service and psychotropic medication use, engagement in productive activities, confidence to use, and actual use of, CBT skills, and their childâ€™s quality of life. Seventy-six parents opted in;56 commenced the trial. Cascade achieved good parent engagement and most Cascade parents were satisfied and reported benefits. Some parents expressed concerns about the time burden and the group format. Most outcomes did not differ across trial arms. Cascade parents felt more confident to use more CBT skills than peer-support and waitlisted parents, but this did not lead to more use of CBT. Cascade parents reported lower psychosocial health scores for their child than waitlisted parents. Cascade parentsâ€™ health service use, psychotropic medication use, and days engaged in productive activities did not improve, despite some improvements in waitlisted parents. Our trial was difficult to implement, but participants were largely satisfied. Cascade did not improve most outcomes, possibly because many parents were functioning well pre-enrolment. We used these findings to improve Cascade and will trial the new version in future.","Wakefield, Claire E.; Sansom-Daly, Ursula M.; McGill, Brittany C.; Hetherington, Kate, Ellis, Sarah J.; Robertson, Eden G.; Donoghoe, Mark W.; McCarthy, Maria, Kelada, Lauren, Girgis, Afaf, King, Madeleine, Grootenhuis, Martha, Anazodo, Antoinette, Patterson, Pandora, Lowe, Cherie, Dalla-Pozza, Luciano, Miles, Gordon, Cohn, Richard J.","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13225597","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Cancers; 13(22):5597, 2021.; Publication details: Cancers; 13(22):5597, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22954,""
"Sex-Specific Microglial Activation and SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Expression Induced by Chronic Unpredictable Stress","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a lot of stress and anxiety among not only infected patients but also general population across the globe, which disturbs cerebral immune homeostasis and potentially exacerbates the SARS-CoV-2 virus-induced neuroinflammation, especially among people susceptible for neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we used a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model to study its effects on glia-mediated neuroinflammation and expressions of SARS-CoV2 viral receptors. We observed that female mice showed depressive-like behavior after CUMS, whereas male mice showed enhanced anxiety and social withdrawal. Interestingly, CUMS led to increased amounts of total and MHCII+ microglia in the hippocampi of female mice but not males. mRNA levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Ace2) and basigin (Bsg) were also upregulated in the prefrontal cortices of stressed females but not males. Similarly, sex-specific changes in SARS-CoV-2 viral receptors FURIN and neuropilin-1 (NRP1) were also observed in monocytes of human caregivers enduring chronic stress. Our findings provided evidence on detrimental effects of chronic stress on brain and behavior and implied potential sex-dependent susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection after chronic stress.","Yan, Ling, Jayaram, Mohan, Chithanathan, Keerthana, Zharkovsky, Alexander, Tian, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2021.750373","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience;2021.; Publication details: Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22955,""
"Rates of Anxiety, Depression, and Stress Among High School Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was first reported in Wuhan, China, and has since then spread worldwide, resulting in a large number of hospitalizations and deaths. To the best of our knowledge, the study about the mental health status (depression, anxiety, and stress) among high school students during COVID-19 has not been performed in Iran. Objective: This study was performed to investigate rates of anxiety, depression, and stress among high school students during the pandemic of COVID- 19. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed among high school students (12-18 years) from 30 April until 1 June 2020, in Hamadan City, west of Iran. In total, 2852 students contributed to the present study. Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (DASS-21) was used in this study. Statistical analyses were conducted in STATA 14 with a significant level of 0.05. Results: The present study showed that although stress status was normal among most high school students (70.3%), the status of anxiety and depression was high. The boys had reported a higher proportion of normal status of depression (51.62% vs. 44.97%), anxiety (31.71% vs. 26.91%), and stress (77.66% vs. 66.10%) compared to the girls. Also, students in grades 7-9 had reported a higher percentage of normal status in all three dimensions of stress, anxiety, and depression. Conclusion: These findings suggest that as rates of depression and anxiety are high, schoolage children may benefit from policymakers and other authorities' active role.","Jenabi, E.; Bashirian, S.; Khazaei, S.; Poorsdavood, M.; Heidarimoghadam, R.; Barati, M.; Shirahmadi, S.; Zareian, S.; Shamsaei, F.; Farzian, S.; Asgari, A.; Nankali, Y.; Haghighi, M.","https://doi.org/10.2174/2666082217666210924143126","","Database: Web of Science; Publication details: Current Psychiatry Research and Reviews; 17(2):98-104, 2021.; Publication details: Current Psychiatry Research and Reviews; 17(2):98-104, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22956,""

"Designing a Chatbot System for Recommending College Students to Counseling and Collecting Dialogue Data","In Japan, the number of college students suffering from changes in the communicative environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing. However, many college students do not use on-campus counseling services even though they are available. The reason for this is students' psychological barriers to counseling. Therefore, we designed a chatbot to reduce the psychological barrier and recommend counseling services to college students. We defined dialogue tasks for maintaining mental health, i.e., lifelogging, confiding, and recommending counseling services. We also defined the required and optional slots for each dialogue task. We used crowdsourcing to collect an example dataset of ideal dialogues between chatbots and users. From the collected data, we categorized the chatbot's responses and design a task-and slot-based response-selection method that is based on Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis.

Totally, 461 potential references recorded through Endnote and imported. Out of the 117 potential titles and abstracts screened by two independent researchers through Covidence, 54 full-text assessed for eligibility of which, 28 were included. Quality of studies and risk of bias were then assessed.ResultsStudies carried out in 4 continents and 14 countries while recruiting female and male players aging range from 9 to 30. These indicate that the 11+ has been investigated worldwide. Quality of studies was moderate to high and except an unclear amount of bias for blinding outcome assessment;risk of bias for all domains was low. Excepting lower extremity stability, ankle evertors time latency and proprioception improvement, application of the 11+ at long-term (a complete football season) appeared to be successful in improving a variety of performance tests e.g. agility, sprinting, balance, jumping, cutting maneuvers etc;physiological responses and a majority of biomechanical measures. Vice versa, that the 11+ causes acute negative impact on the physical performance and technical abilities compared to the dynamic warm ups was highlighted in two studies.ConclusionApplication of the 11+ as warm up routine during trainings at long-term with higher adherence can be recommended for improving performance. However, caution must be observed while recruiting the 11+ for warming up before competitions as it may acutely decrease physical performance and technical abilities. Given the contradictory nature of the literature, further studies should evaluate short-term effects of the programme.","Asgari, Mojtaba, Jaitner, Thomas, Nazari, Bahareh","https://doi.org/10.1136/bjsports-2021-IOC.190","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: British Journal of Sports Medicine; 55(Suppl 1):A80-A81, 2021.; Publication details: British Journal of Sports Medicine; 55(Suppl 1):A80-A81, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22961,""
"Psychological distress and maladaptive coping in olympic-level swimmers following postponement of the 2020 olympic games due to COVID-19","BackgroundElite-level athletes are vulnerable to psychological distress due to rigorous training and competitive schedules. Psychological screening is a preventative strategy to target athletes at risk for maladaptive coping and psychopathology;however, psychological screening is rarely implemented in elite sport environments.ObjectiveTo assess psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, psychological strain, and burnout) and coping behavior in Olympic-level swimmers following a major athletic stressor: postponement of the 2020 Olympics due to COVID-19.DesignA retrospective mixed-methods design was used.SettingAn online psychological assessment and a follow-up telehealth semi-structured interview were completed.ParticipantsParticipants (n=14) included international swimmers who: achieved a top 10 time;placed in the top 3 in their 2019 national meet;or qualified for the World Championships.Assessment of Risk FactorsAnxiety, psychological strain, and burnout were evaluated as risk factors for maladaptive coping.Outcome MeasurementsAssessment included Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Athlete Psychological Strain Questionnaire (APSQ), and Athletic Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ) scales. Coping behaviors were derived from interview content (available for 12 of the 14 participants).ResultsFindings (mean Â± SD) indicated mild anxiety (6.29 Â± 4.87) and severe psychological strain (22.71 Â± 4.83). Higher psychological strain associated with higher emotional and physical exhaustionâ€”a subscale of the ABQ (r = 0.791;p = 0.001). A subset of athletes (n=5) reported moderate-to-severe anxiety. Most athletes (n = 9) practiced maladaptive coping (75%) (e.g., behavioral and mental disengagement);however, maladaptive coping was more frequent in athletes with greater psychological distress.ConclusionsSeveral athletes reported levels of anxiety and psychological strain that, according to APSQ and GAD-7 guidelines, necessitated clinical evaluation.

"Black and ethnic minority carers perceptions on mental health services and support in the United Kingdom: a systematic review","PurposeThe purpose of this study was to examine and synthesise the empirical evidence on the perceptions of Black and Ethnic Minority (BAME) carers views on mental health (MH) services and support offered in the UK.Design/methodology/approachA comprehensive search conducted by searching Medline, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection served to identify relevant studies that explored the perceptions of BAME carers on MH services. Other key sources and reference list of identified journal articles were searched to ascertain that this review contains all relevant studies and captured studies not indexed in the databases. Using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool, 20 relevant studies published between 1996 and 2020 retrieved were and reviewed. From the reviewed papers five themes emerged which summarised the perception of BAME carers views on MH services and support services offered in the UK.FindingsCritical appraisal of 20 studies that met the ascribed inclusion criteria was undertaken. A total of 18 studies were of qualitative design, one used a quantitative approach and one was a systematic review. Several themes addressing the participantsâ€™ views were identified from the studies. The core themes central to these studies were: awareness and utilization of available MH services, language barriers to accessing MH services, positive experience whilst in contact with MH services, negative experience whilst in contact with MH services and difficulties in seeking help.Research limitations/implicationsOne of the review criteria was to focus on peer-reviewed articles;grey literature was exempted from the search for relevant studies. Although a systematic literature review was conducted, there is the possibility that some appropriate studies were not identified. This could be because of different use of key terms in some of the studies. Papers that identified and acknowledged BAME MH carers and MH services were focused on, which resulted in 20 eligible studies for synthesis.Originality/valueThis review revealed the perception of BAME carers on MH services and available support offered. It highlighted that a significant number of BAME carers had limited understanding of the range of available MH services and support on offer within the UK. The review highlighted that fear of stigmatisation, discrimination in conjunction with the formulaic nature of MH services, delayed at best and inhibited at worst BAME Carers from accessing support from MH services, which consequentially had detrimental effects on service users receiving the timely appropriate support needed (Mermon et al., 2016). It is, therefore, a recommended imperative that MH services are deliberate in their endeavour to be inclusive, culturally embracing and accessible, if the MH needs of diverse ethnic minority groups within the UK are to be met appropriately.","Miller, Eula, Bosun-Arjie, Stella Foluke, Mandu Stephen, Ekpenyong","https://doi.org/10.1108/JPMH-12-2020-0152","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Journal of Public Mental Health; 20(4):298-311, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Public Mental Health; 20(4):298-311, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22963,""
"On graphic mental illness narratives: an interview with Clem Martini, Tatiana Gill and Tyler Page","Mental illness continues to be the most stigmatized medical condition across cultures. Autobiographical accounts on affective disorders/mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression among others not only foreground the distinctive circumstances of oneâ€™s suffering but also poignantly portray what it means to undergo the disquieting phases of treatment (such as drug therapy and institutionalisation). As such, these narratives open up dialogues about mental illness which otherwise remain stigmatised and thus contribute to overcome discrimination associated with mental illness. Of late, graphic medicine, one of the burgeoning genres of comics, have widened the scope of such first-person accounts of mental illness. Coined by a British physician and comics artist, Ian Williams in 2007, graphic medicine, typically narrated by patients, (professional) caregivers or physicians, refers to the intersection of comics and healthcare. Prominent graphic mental illness memoirs include Darryl Cunninghamâ€™s Psychiatric Tales (2010), Ellen Forneyâ€™s Marbles: Mania, Depression, Michelangelo & Me (2012), and Rachel Lindsayâ€™s Rx (2018). In their mission to counteract medicineâ€™s dogmatic and reductionist approaches, these visual memoirs foreground a plethora of subjective experiences as they also expose and change the current mental health procedures for the better. Taking these cues and in the context of deteriorating global mental health prompted by COVID-19 pandemics, three authors, Clem Martini, Tyler Page and Tatiana Gill, in an email interview share their views on mental illness, graphic medicine, identity crisis, stigma, and, the larger systemic challenges of mental illness treatments and care-giving. The interview consists of two parts. In the first part Drawing Mental Illness the authors respond to questions common to all of them and in the second part Greater Choice, Better Care each of them answer specific questions pertaining to their respective memoir.

"Tracking the evolution of crisis processes and mental health on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all aspects of society, bringing health hazards and posing challenges to public order, governments, and mental health. This study examines the stages of crisis response and recovery as a sociological problem by operationalising a well-known model of crisis stages in terms of a psycho-linguistic analysis. Based on an extensive collection of Twitter data spanning from March to August 2020 in Argentina, we present a thematic study on the differences in language used in social media posts and look at indicators that reveal the distinctive stages of a crisis and the country response thereof. The analysis was combined with a study of the temporal prevalence of mental health related conversations and emotions. This approach can provide insights for public health policy design to monitor and eventually intervene during the different stages of a crisis, thus improving the adverse mental health effects on the population.

"Core belief disruption amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Japanese adults","Due to the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide, most people have been forced to alter their lifestyles. This situation may affect the mental health of individuals through the disruption of core beliefs about humans, the world, and the self. Therefore, in this study, an online survey of Japanese adults was conducted to investigate the associations between subjective achievement and the burden of cooperation in preventive measures, disruption of core beliefs, and psychological distress. The results showed that pandemic-induced disruption of core beliefs occurred at a relatively low level in the general population of Japan. In addition, the achievement and psychological burden of preventive measures, reduced income due to the pandemic, and stressfulness of the pandemic were significantly associated with the level of the disruption of core beliefs. Moreover, the greater the disruption of core beliefs, the greater the psychological distress. These findings indicate that the violation of fundamental assumptions about life are an important factor determining mental health during a pandemic.","Matsudaira, Izumi, Takano, Yuji, Yamaguchi, Ryo, Taki, Yasuyuki","https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-021-00976-7","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1), 2021.; Publication details: Humanities & Social Sciences Communications; 8(1), 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22967,""
"Assessing costs of developing a digital program for training community health workers to deliver treatment for depression: A case study in rural India","Digital technology has emerged as a promising approach for training and building capacity of community health workers in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Little is known about the cost of developing digital training programs in LMICs, which hinders the adoption, implementation, and scaling up of the programs in routine primary care settings. This study assessed the costs of developing a digital program for training community health workers to deliver a psychological treatment for depression in a rural district of Madhya Pradesh, India. We developed survey instruments to document required resources in development, including involved personnel (their roles, responsibilities, time spent, and salaries or payments), information technologies (e.g., smartphones, software programs), and infrastructure-related costs (e.g., vehicle, office space, utilities). Costs were estimated from an accounting perspective. Over a 10-month developmental period, the total costs were 208,814 USD, with the largest portion on human resources (61%, with 14% on management and supervision), followed by information technologies (33%), and infrastructure-related costs (6%). These findings could inform policymakers in LMICs on costs of developing online-training programs, which will be especially useful during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Joshi, Udita, Naslund, John A.; Anand, Aditya, Tugnawat, Deepak, Vishwakarma, Ram, Bhan, Anant, Patel, Vikram, Lu, Chunling","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.114299","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114299, 2021.; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114299, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22968,""
"The ecology of youth psychological wellbeing in the covid-19 pandemic","The consequences of profound disruption to everyday life caused by the COVID-19 pandemic will only emerge over time. Guided by ecological systems (Pitchik et al., 2021) and a developmental psychopathology (Masten & Cicchetti, 2010) frameworks, I review evidence that points to parents at home with children as particularly vulnerable to increased psychological difficulties, particularly in contexts of poverty. Resultant compromized parenting may reduce childrenâ€™s opportunities for the kinds of everyday interactions that promote cognitive and socioemotional development, and expose them increases in coercive, avoidant, and other problematic caregiving behaviours. I discuss three evidence-based strategies that parents could adopt to buffer their childâ€™s mental health: building positive discipline strategies, talking with the child about the pandemic and its consequences, and conversing about the past. I conclude, however, that approaches to supporting parents and their children at this time must also address multisystem factors that compromize caregiversâ€™ ability to provide nurturing care.","Salmon, Karen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmac.2021.11.002","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22969,""
"Disordered eating across COVID-19 in LGBTQ+ young adults","Emerging evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively affecting mental health, especially for sexual and gender minority populations. Relatively little is known about the impact of the pandemic on disordered eating behaviors (DEB) for these populations. The aim of this study is to understand changes in DEB across COVID-19 within an LGBTQ+ sample, with a particular focus on differences across sexual and gender identities, and the impact of social support on these outcomes. In a sample of 830 LGBTQ+ adults with a past year history of DEB, most, but not all, participants reported that the frequency of and urge to engage in each DEB increased a little bit or a lot during COVID-19. Contrary to research showing more severe psychopathology and DEB among gender minorities (GM) compared to sexual minorities (SM), changes in DEB severity since COVID-19 were not significantly different between SM and GM participants. There were a few small and significant relationships between changes in average DEB severity and characteristics of interpersonal relationships, average quality of home relationships, and living with someone not affirming of one's identity. Results highlight that COVID-19 may have exacerbated DEB for SGM young adults, that these changes were not different across sexual versus gender minorities, and that these changes are weakly but significantly related to minority stressors.","Hart, Erica A.; Rubin, Alex, Kline, Kiki M.; Fox, Kathryn R.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2021.101581","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Eating Behaviors;: 101581, 2021.; Publication details: Eating Behaviors;: 101581, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22970,""
"What are the mental health impacts of epidemics on relatives of people affected, and relatives of healthcare workers: What interventions are available to support them? A systematic review and narrative synthesis","Background: Previous research has mainly focused on the impacts of epidemics on those people who are directly affected by the epidemic infection, or of healthcare workers caring for them. Less is known about the impact on mental health of their relatives, and potential interventions to support them. Methods: Systematic review and narrative synthesis. Outcomes: 28 studies were identified, sixteen quantitative and twelve qualitative. One involved health workers' relatives, and the rest covered relatives of directly affected individuals. We found considerable burden of mental ill-health in both groups. Among relatives of healthcare workers, 29.4% reported symptoms consistent with probable anxiety disorder and 33.7% with probable depression. Prevalence rates for probable anxiety disorder ranged from 24 to 42% and probable depression 17â€“51% for the relatives of affected people. One study found a 2% prevalence of PTSD and another found odds of PTSS were significantly higher among relatives of affected individuals compared with the general population. Only two intervention studies were identified and both were descriptive in nature. Interpretation: Available evidence suggests relatives of people affected by infective outbreaks report mental ill-health. Having a relative who died particularly increased risk. Good outcomes for relatives of affected individuals were promoted by practical and social support, public health guidance that recognises the caring role of relatives, and being supported to see the positives as well as negatives in their situation. Good outcomes for relatives of health workers were promoted by perceived effectiveness of protective equipment. High quality evidence on potential interventions to support relatives is lacking. Funding: No external funding sought.","Gentry, Sarah V.; Thomas-Meyer, Molly, Tyrrell, Carina S.

"Psychiatric hospitalization in Korea, 2011-2020: the impact of the Mental Health Act revision of 2017 in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic","Objective This study was performed to examine the changes in utilization of inpatient and outpatient care for schizophrenia in Korea prior and subsequent to the mental health law revision of 2017 in consideration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods The number of outpatients and outpatient visits and the number of inpatients and lengths of stay for schizophrenia from 2011 to 2020 were obtained for National Health Insurance beneficiaries and Medical Aid beneficiaries, and their changes during the period were compared with those for other psychiatric disorders and all causes other than psychiatric disorders. With difference-in-differences analysis, the changes in utilization of inpatient and outpatient care for schizophrenia after the law revision in 2017 were analyzed with two comparison groups. Results While the number of inpatients and length of hospital stays for schizophrenia decreased between 2017 and 2019, the number of outpatients and outpatient visits for schizophrenia increased during the period. The decrease in inpatient care for schizophrenia after the revision is in contrast with the increase in two other groups. While the COVID pandemic in 2019 lead to the general decrease in health case use among the population, the decrease was most distinct for schizophrenia. Difference-in-differences analysis showed that the law revision was associated with the decrease in the use of inpatient care for schizophrenia. Conclusions The mental health law revision in Korea led to a significant decrease in hospitalization of people with schizophrenia, and this effect was significant after adjustment for the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Agnus M.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102934","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 102934, 2021.; Publication details: Asian Journal of Psychiatry;: 102934, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22973,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Radiology Resident Education: Where do we go from here?","The Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused a dramatic shift in radiology resident education. Primarily, physical distancing prompted a general transition to virtual learning. Common changes made by radiology residency programs included virtual rounds and readouts, the use of simulation technology, and case-based learning which utilized pedagogical approaches such as the flipped classroom for teaching residents. Virtual learning appears to be a suitable alternative to traditional, in-person learning, and may have a place post-pandemic as part of a blended curriculum with in-person and virtual components. The extent of disruption to radiology resident education varied based on the local impact of COVID-19 and the prevalence of redeployment, as did residentsâ€™ mental health and wellbeing. Accessibility of mental health resources for residents was highlighted as an issue that programs need to address during these difficult times. Moreover, the pandemic resulted in unavoidable reductions in procedural exposure which programs mitigated through the use of simulation technologies and virtual learning resources. Professional development activities such as mentorship and career planning were also dramatically impacted by the pandemic and remains a challenge that programs need to consider moving forward post-pandemic. The purpose of this review is to outline the changes made to radiology resident education as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and suggest what changes may be worthwhile to continue.","Patil, Nikhil, Gunter, Dane, Larocque, Natasha","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.acra.2021.11.015","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication details: Academic Radiology;2021.; Publication details: Academic Radiology;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22974,""
"Role of Cold Form Steel in Covid-19 Infra Structure","The COVID-19 pandemic requires large scale infrastructure facilities within a short span of time for quarantining the people by introducing partition in the existing building or to construct light weight structures which can be dismantled or altered in future. Medical facilities like covid triage center need to set up in many areas. Also most of hospital facilities like emergency, obstetric services, toilet facilities need to be duplicated for both covid and non covid patients. All the above requirements can be easily fabricated by using cold form steel sections which is known for its ease of construction, light weight, low cost, high strength properties and speedy construction. The speed of construction can be increased tremendously since no skilled man power will be required for the erection of cold form steel structure. It can be assembled by semi-skilled man power as do it yourself (DIY) kit. Minimum tools like screw gun and cutter will only be required for the erection. A prototype CFS-based covid infrastructure with its components will be discussed in detail. Connections which play a key role in cold form steel construction are also covered. Further, in this paper, the sequence and methodology adopted in the installation of the above said services required during COVID-19 has been discussed in detail.

"Covid-19 and mental disorders: Data analysis and perspectives","The study was carried out in order to study the clinical features of the mental state in people who have suffered from the infectious disease COVID-19 for the development of adequate measures of medical prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and medical rehabilitation. The persons who suffered from the infectious disease COVID-19 sent for medical rehabilitation in the Â«Republican Scientific and Practical Center for Medical Expertise and RehabilitationÂ» were examined: 95 patients (M/ W=44/51) aged 51Â±4.21 years. Symptoms of depressive disorder were detected in 27 (28.5%) patients when filling out the Beckâ€™s Depression Inventory (BDI-D). Symptoms of anxiety disorder were observed in 92 (87.4%) patients when filling out Beckâ€™s Anxiety Inventory (BDI-A). Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder were detected only in 6 (6.3%) patients when filling out the General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7). Symptoms of distress were detected in 79 (85.0%) patients when filling out the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). When filling out the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), 78 (82.1%) patients of the examined patients had sleep disorders. According to the results of the correlation analysis, there were no reliable relationships between the severity of these mental disorders and the severity of the infectious disease COVID-19 (p&gt;0.05). There was also no gender difference in the occurrence of mental disorders in patients who suffered from the infectious disease COVID-19. There was a significantly strong correlation between the severity of depressive symptoms in patients and the severity of distress (r=0.823;p&lt;0.001). A significant relationship between the symptoms of anxiety and depression was confirmed (r=0.753;p&lt;0.001).

"Effect of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease on cognition in adolescents","Background: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by macrovesicular hepatic steatosis occurring in the absence of significant alcohol consumption or identifiable secondary causes of hepatic lipid accumulation. Estimated prevalence of pediatric NAFLD in the United States has increased from 3.8% in 1988-1994 to 10% -12 % in 2007-2018. Pediatric obesity rates have also risen, with a prevalence among adolescents 12-19 years of 21% in 2018. Cognitively, recent studies have shown an association between NAFLD and deficits in executive functioning and visuospatial domains;the etiology is uncertain but may relate to increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and microvascular changes altering neuronal functioning and cerebral perfusion. Studies associating NAFLD and decreased cerebral volume even after controlling for cardiometabolic risk factors suggest hepatic steatosis can influence brain development. Objective: To investigate the potential association between NAFLD and neurocognitive and social/emotional health in adolescents. Methods: Study of three groups comprised of a convenience-based sample of participants, 12 to 17 years of age, recruited from an outpatient pediatric gastroenterology clinic. NAFLD Group (n=15) included youth with BMI = 95th% for age/sex, hepatic ultrasound with increased echogenicity compatible with hepatic steatosis, and ALT &gt; 2 times upper limit of normal. Elevated BMI Group (n=16) included youth with BMI = 95th% for age/sex and normal ALT. Non-obese Control Group (n=15) included youth with BMI &lt;95th % for age/ and sex normal ALT. The study included subjects proficient in English and English or Spanish speaking parent/legal guardian available to participate in the consent process. Exclusion criteria included individuals with documented causes of liver disease (e.g., known hepatotoxic medications, autoimmune hepatitis, hemachromatosis, viral hepatitis, rheumatalogic diseases), or treatment with combined hormonal contraceptives, antipsychotic or diabetic medications. Using the NIH Toolbox iPad app, subjects were administered the Sadness, Emotional Support, & Anxiety self-report measures and three performance-based cognitive tasks: Picture Vocabulary Test, Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test, and Dimensional Change Card Sort Test. Statistical analyses of primary outcome measures included one-way ANOVAs, unpaired Student's t-tests, and Pearson correlations to assess relationships between dependent and independent variables. Results: No significant group differences for demographics, social/emotional outcomes, vocabulary test, or dimensional card sort test were observed. ANOVA of the Flanker Test of Inhibition and Attention was significant (p= 0.047), and post-hoc t-tests revealed Elevated BMI group scored significantly lower than the non-obese controls (p=0.03). Pearson correlation analysis of the total study sample revealed a significant inverse relationship between BMI and Flanker Test (r= -0.38, p &lt;0.001). Exploratory analysis revealed a significant increase in BMI of study subjects enrolled following onset of COVID-19 pandemic (n=22) compared to subjects enrolled pre-pandemic (n=23), p= 0.03. Conclusions: We found no significant difference in social/emotional health or cognitive functioning between adolescents with NAFLD and those without NAFLD from our pediatric GI clinic. However, adolescents with elevated BMI (without NAFLD) performed significantly below non-obese controls on a measure of attention and inhibition. We also found a significant inverse relationship between BMI and attentional processing and inhibition for our overall adolescent sample. These results are consistent with studies reporting lower cognitive function in obese adults and improved neurocognitive outcomes in adults following bariatric surgery. Studies with children and adolescents are limited but our data support findings from a previous adolescent study citing a negative correlation between elevated BMI and cognition. Our study adds to a growing body of research in pediatric populations. tudy limitations include potential impact of confounding variables, namely the environment in which the cognitive tests were administered -a busy outpatient GI clinic- as well as possible inclusion of undiagnosed NAFLD patients in the elevated BMI group, as our study included a mix of both newly referred patients and established patients. Interestingly, we must also consider and further explore the potential impact of COVID-19 pandemic, as across all three of our study groups, pre-pandemic patients had a lower BMI compared to patients enrolled during the pandemic.","Saurman, V.; Hartman, L.; Daniel, R.; Lowry, S.; Grant, M.; Mitchell, E.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Effect+of+non-alcoholic+fatty+liver+disease+on+cognition+in+adolescents","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition; 73(1 SUPPL 1):S280-S281, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition; 73(1 SUPPL 1):S280-S281, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22977,""
"Experiential avoidance in the context of the health contingency by COVID-19","The current health contingency resulting from COVID-19 is having a significant impact on the lives of people around the world, having repercussions not only on a physical level but also on a psychological level. Various organizations and researchers at national and international level have drawn attention to the consequences at the mental health level that could be evident in the short, medium and long term. In this context, the presence and chronification of patterns of experiential avoidance can be evidenced at a general level, to the extent that people invest time and energy in controlling, reducing, or changing their unpleasant thoughts, emotions and sensations in the face of the pandemic, the coronavirus-2019 and/or all the meanings that arise in each person. Experiential avoidance or psychological rigidity can prolong suffering and have a great psychological cost, so the alternative to this behavioral pattern could be found in psychological fexibility.","Santamaria-Galeano, C.

"The opioid epidemic: a geography in two phases","The United States has been experiencing a drug overdose mortality epidemic marked by the introduction and spread of opioids across rural and urban communities over the past 20 years. The current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has overshadowed the opioid epidemic but aggravated the opioid problem by hindering access to health services and increasing the number of people out of work. Research on the geography of the opioid epidemic has focused on the association between declining local economic opportunities and increases in drug overdose mortality since 2000, but the link has not always been strong. This study identifies two phases comprising the epidemic and examines their differing demographic and geographic natures. Results show that in the first phase, beginning around 2000 and ending in the early 2010s, drug overdose mortality rates soared among the middle aged as prescription opioid painkillers drove the epidemic. Physical disability is associated with chronic pain, and during this period, drug overdose deaths rose most in areas with high physical disability rates. The researchers found little evidence that the aggravation of local economic problems was associated with increases in drug overdose mortality in the 2000s. Since the early 2010s, opioid drug reformulation and declining prescription rates have resulted in ebbing mortality from prescription opioids. At the same time, illicit opioids such as heroin and, increasingly, fentanyl and related synthetic opioids rapidly entered the scene-causing a growing share of drug overdose deaths, marking the beginning of what the researchers call the illicit opioid phase of the epidemic. In this phase, drug overdose mortality has risen, particularly among young adult males, and its geography has shifted markedly. Physical disability seems less a factor in rising drug overdose mortality than local (county) economic hardship and outmigration in the northeastern quadrant of the United States, where the marketing of these drugs currently appears most developed.","McGranahan, D.

"Impact of COVID-19 related restrictions on eating behaviors and mental well being of children 5-12 years of age in Middlesex County, NJ","The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a variety of unprecedented pressures on our society. Many families face pressures due to unforeseen changes in daily life and a lack of resources to cope. In addition, imposed sedentary environment and limitation of opportunities for outdoor activities created the set up for the increase in obesity in children. Rapid weight gain and mental difficulties are now reported in children and adolescents. Objective: This study aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on weight gain, eating behaviors, and emotional responses in children between the ages of 5-12 years. Follow up survey is planned in 6 months to evaluate the persistence or resolution of these behaviors. Design/Methods: The study was conducted in a general pediatric clinic at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital, NJ. A survey included the validated Family Eating and Activity Habits Questionnaire (FEAHQ), Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and questions to ascertain socio-economic conditions of the family. Medical records were reviewed for demographic characteristics. Results: A total of 104 families with 156 children (53% boys) of diverse self-reported race- 58% White, 12% Black, and 44% identified as Hispanic/Latino participated. The mean age of the child was 8.5 years. At least one adult caretaker had a post-secondary education in 64% of the families. 30% of children had BMI&gt;95% and 46% &gt;85%, higher than documented prior to the pandemic. The prevalence of obesity was higher in families with food insecurity (FI) and those with lower educational levels of parents (LELP). Obesogenic behaviors (total FEAHQ score) were significantly higher in families with LELP (high-school or less vs college-educated, p=0.004) and FI (insecure vs secure) as well. Behavioral problems were noted in 14 % of the children, of those 47% occurred after the onset of the pandemic. 39% severely affected family functioning. Boys were affected significantly more than girls. Conclusion: 1. Increased prevalence of childhood obesity is noted in the following COVID-19 isolation. 2. Obesogenic behaviors are disproportionately affecting families with LELP and with FI, which may make these groups a focus for the more aggressive interventions. 3. Emotional health is adversely affected by COVID-19 isolation not only in adolescents but also in younger children 4. Boys are more affected than girls by mental health problems. 4. A follow-up survey in 6 months will assess adjustment over time to varying levels of social restriction.","Iofel, E.; Quinn, M.; Sena, C.; Thaker, V.","https://www.google.com/search?q=Impact+of+COVID-19+related+restrictions+on+eating+behaviors+and+mental+well+being+of+children+5-12+years+of+age+in+Middlesex+County,+NJ","","Database: EMBASE; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition; 73(1 SUPPL 1):S274-S275, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition; 73(1 SUPPL 1):S274-S275, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22980,""
"Intensive outpatient treatment of pediatric rumination syndrome in the era of telemedicine","Background: Rumination syndrome is a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID) that involves effortless postprandial regurgitation of food followed either by rechewing or expulsion, and can be challenging to both diagnose and treat effectively. Patients with more severe symptoms require intensive management. At our institution, we have had success treating children with severe rumination syndrome using a multidisciplinary intensive outpatient program (IOP) involving multiple treatment sessions daily. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have needed to transition from in-person treatment to telemedicine. The objective of this study is to compare outcomes of patients with rumination syndrome who completed IOP treatment in person versus by telemedicine. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients diagnosed with rumination syndrome by Rome IV criteria and participated in IOP treatment from 2018-2020. IOP consists of intensive medical and behavioral treatment provided by a specialized multidisciplinary team. Until March 2020, this program involved 3 in-person treatment sessions with meals per day for up to a week. Similar treatment sessions were performed during telemedicine visits. We compared outcomes of patients who received IOP treatment in person versus by telemedicine. Families/patients were then asked to complete a survey outlining their child's current rumination symptom severity and review of the IOP. Results: We included 34 patients (79% F, median age 15 years, range 7-19 years) with rumination syndrome who completed IOP treatment. Patients had also been diagnosed with anxiety (17/34, 50%), depression (7/34, 21%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (6/34, 18%), constipation (6/34, 18%), functional abdominal pain (5/34, 15%), eating disorder (5/34, 15%), and superior mesenteric artery syndrome (4/34, 12%). At baseline, 9 patients (26%) required tube feeding or parenteral nutrition compared to 2 patients (6%) at follow up. Twenty-six patients (76%) were treated in person and 8 patients (24%) by telemedicine. There were no significant differences in sex, age, likelihood of anxiety or depression, and duration of IOP treatment between in person and telemedicine groups. The median duration of treatment for both groups was 4 days. Symptom severity at baseline and follow up are described in Table 1. For patients treated in person, 76% (19/25) had improvement in symptoms while 16% (4/25) had complete resolution of symptoms. For patients treated by telemedicine, 88% (7/8) had improvement in their symptoms. There were no significant differences between groups in likelihood of improvement. Of the 34 patients who completed the IOP, 23 (68%) completed both surveys. Overall, 78% (18/23) preferred in person therapy while 17% (4/23) did not have a preference. Of the telemedicine patients, 60% (3/5) would have preferred in-person IOP. All 18 of the in-person cohort preferred in-person management. When asked to elaborate, 4 families expressed similar answers including the need for â€œin-person interaction,â€ having a â€œhands-on approach,â€ and because the psychologist can give â€œbody instructions.â€ Other reported strengths of in-person treatment included a majority of families believing this would lead to â€œa stronger connection with the providerâ€ (90%, 19/21), â€œfewer distractionsâ€ (86%, 18/21), and noting â€œtreatment would be more effective in personâ€ (76%, 16/21). In-person challenges included transportation and parking (63%, 12/19) as well as concerns about time commitment (84%, 16/19). The primary strengths of online treatment were that it saves time (72%,13/18) and some parents felt their child was more comfortable at home (39%,7/18). One family described that it was â€œeasier to integrate habits at homeâ€ after completing the process online. Online challenges included having more distractions (81%, 13/16) and some parents felt their child was more comfortable talking to someone in person (75%, 12/16). Conclusion: Although multidisciplinary intensive outpatient treatment for children and adolescents with severe rumination syndrome is effective and the likelihood of improvement appears similar when completed in person or by telemedicine, the majority of families prefer in-person therapy.","Hawa, K.; Van Diest, A.

"Receptor effects and therapeutic spectrum of mirtazapine","Mirtazapine is a dual-acting antidepressant that acts on both noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission through alpha-2 receptor antagonism. It has a unique pharmacological profile among other antidepressants. Antidepressant effect appears in moderate to severe depression. It also shows anxiolytic effect. Antagonism to 5-HT3-receptors provides indications for prescribing the antidepressant for anxiety and sleep disorders. Antagonism to 5-HT3-receptors determines the antiemetic effect and suppression of excessive release of mesolimbic dopamine. The toxic effects are significantly less pronounced if compared to tricyclic antidepressants. There are no drug interactions and serotonin syndrome. Therapy with mirtazapine should be started with the dose of 15 mg per day followed by the increase to therapeutic dose. The dose exceeding 30â€“45 mg per day does not add a significant therapeutic effect. The antidepressant should be administered in the evening, taking into account sedative and hypnotic effect in the initial period of therapy. Mirtazapine can be given as monotherapy or in combination with other medicines. The most effective combination for treatment of resistant depression appears to be the combination of mirtazapine and venlafaxine. Mirtazapine can be effectively used in treatment of functional disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, pain and diarrhea. It reduces the risk of complications and death from COVID-19. Â© 2021, Professionalnye Izdaniya.

"User's perceptions and online education acceptance in the new normal at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Saudi Arabia","Research on Information Technology has demonstrated that IT is an indispensable tool for achieving better and effective education among others, as it provides both educators and learners with easy-to-access information, accelerated learning, and makes people to gain 21st-century technical skills necessary for future occupations etc. however, research on IT is still ongoing, giving room for more contributions. One aspect of IT cutting the attention of researchers in the recent times is online education. It is in-thing in this present era particularly with the current situation of Covid-19 pandemic which brought about some changes in the way education is being conducted in terms of teaching and learning among teachers and students. Although, online education is gaining more popularity day by day, however, its acceptance among different categories of users is a major issue of concerned which has resulted to several divergent views and findings. Unfortunately, majority of the effort is concentrated on one user particularly between the teachers and the students. It is critical to know that both academic staff and students are indispensable when you talk about online education and therefore should be included in any research of this nature for better insight. This deficiency provided the present study the opportunity to investigate the user's perceptions and online education acceptance. Thus, the study investigates user's perceptions and online education acceptance in the new normal at Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Saudi Arabia. It adopted a survey research design while the population covered all the lecturers and teachers in Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University (IMSIU), Saudi Arabia. Of all the copies of questionnaires sent out to the respondents, only 218 returned filled. The returned questionnaires were analysed using STATA version 13 statistical tool. The finding revealed that User's perception is generally a significant predictor of Online Education Acceptance with F(1,214)=94.40, p&gt;0.001;Prob. &gt; F =0.0000. Additionally, it revealed that user's perception also affect Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease-of-Use (PEOU) and Attitudes towards Usage (ATU).

"What protects us against the COVID-19 threat? Cultural tightness matters","BACKGROUND: The only previous studies that formulated a theoretical model of epidemics for psychological response relative to cultural perspectives have focused on the role of individualism-collectivism and have omitted analysis of tightness-looseness. This study explored the role of cultural tightness in relation to psychological disorders during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We recruited 1827 Chinese adolescents (MageÂ = 18.16 Â± 2.23 years, 53.3% female) to participate a cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a series of questionnaires, including the scales of cultural tightness, risk perception of COVID-19 pandemic, perceived protection efficacy, anxiety and depression. A latent moderated structural equations model was used to analyse the mediating and moderating effects of risk perception regarding COVID-19, cultural tightness and perceived protection efficacy on psychological disorders. RESULTS: The results showed that greater risk perception of COVID-19 predicted greater psychological disorders, however cultural tightness moderated this positive relationship. The increase in psychological disorders with risk perception regarding COVID-19 was less pronounced among people who lived in tighter cultural areas. In addition, this moderating effect of cultural tightness was further mediated by perceived protection efficacy; that is, tight culture protects against psychological disorders by enhancing perceived protection efficacy. CONCLUSION: This study enriched the theoretical framework of cultural tightness and indicated its importance in the field of mental health and health policies. It also emphasized the importance of tight culture as a protective factor against psychological disorders in case of COVID-19 outbreaks, providing valuable practical insight into psychological prevention for COVID-19 outbreaks.","Dong, Dan; Chen, Zhipeng; Zong, Min; Zhang, Peng; Gu, Wen; Feng, Yi; Qiao, Zhihong","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-12161-1","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 2139, 2021 Nov 22.; Publication details: BMC Public Health;21(1): 2139, 2021 Nov 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22988,""
"COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and determinants among physicians in a university-based teaching hospital in Thailand","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 vaccines provide renewed hope in the fight against the recent pandemic. To ensure widespread vaccination, it is crucial to analyze vaccine willingness and its determinants among physicians, key health care influencers. This study aimed to assess acceptance rate and identify factors associated with vaccine hesitancy among Thai physicians. METHODS: A cross-sectional online-based questionnaire was distributed to all physicians at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital during March 31, 2021 to April 30, 2021 in order to assess their attitudes toward receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. Reasons for vaccine acceptance and refusal as well as predictors of vaccine hesitancy were analyzed by bivariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: A total of 705 complete responses were received with 95.6% (n = 675) of physicians expressing willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Only one of the 31 physicians (4.4%) who expressed a hesitancy or unwillingness to be vaccinated was a faculty member; the others were physicians-in-training. Approximately one-fifths of physicians surveyed were also not willing to recommend the vaccine to their family members (21.4%, n = 151) or patients (18.7%, n = 132). Using multivariable logistic regression, vaccine hesitancy was independently associated with preference for particular vaccines over the government allocated option, especially for mRNA vaccine (aOR 8.86; 95% CI 1.1-71.54; p = 0.041). Vaccine literacy showed an inverse relationship (aOR 0.34; 95% CI 0.13-0.9; p = 0.029) with vaccine hesitancy. Uncertainty of the vaccine efficacy (83.9%) and fear of adverse events (48.4%) were major concerns contributing to vaccine hesitancy. CONCLUSION: This study revealed a high rate of physician willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine especially among staffs; however, a significant proportion would not currently suggest vaccination to their families or patients. Restrictions on vaccine choice and vaccine illiteracy, together with concerns over adverse effects and uncertainty of efficacy, were associated with negative attitudes toward vaccination. To raise acceptance of the vaccination program, efforts should be made to balance individual preference for vaccine type in addition to increasing the availability of accurate data on safety and efficacy for each vaccine.","Sirikalyanpaiboon, May; Ousirimaneechai, Krittin; Phannajit, Jeerath; Pitisuttithum, Panyavee; Jantarabenjakul, Watsamon; Chaiteerakij, Roongruedee; Paitoonpong, Leilani","https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12879-021-06863-5","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: BMC Infect Dis;21(1): 1174, 2021 Nov 22.; Publication details: BMC Infect Dis;21(1): 1174, 2021 Nov 22.; COVID-19; Physicians; Vaccines; COVID-19 Vaccines; Cross-Sectional Studies; Hospitals, Teaching; Hospitals, University; Humans; SARS-CoV-2; Thailand; Universities; Vaccination; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22989,""
"Current impact and future consequences of the pandemic on children's and adolescents' health; Impacto presente y consecuencias futuras de la pandemia en la salud de niÃ±os, niÃ±as y adolescentes","There is plenty bibliography about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the mental and social health of children, adolescents, and youth. A very high percentage of this population developed emotional symptoms and their levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation increased considerably. The adults who were responsible for generating a support network were impacted and suffered emotional symptoms and job and economic uncertainty. In many children, without a supportive context, exposure to adverse experiences increased, so the pandemic may be considered an adverse experience itself. The future effect of such unfavorable experience on childhood and how family and social support may help to reduce stress through the development of resilience were reviewed. As citizens and health care providers, our responsibility is to reflect, discuss, and develop strategies to mitigate such damage that may have severe consequences on the mental and physical health of children and adults.","Cacchiarelli San RomÃ¡n, NicolÃ¡s; Eymann, Alfredo; Ferraris, Jorge R","https://dx.doi.org/10.5546/aap.2021.eng.e594","","Country: AR; ARGENTINA; ARGENTINA; ARGENTINA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Arch Argent Pediatr;119(6): e594-e599, 2021 12.; Publication details: Arch Argent Pediatr;119(6): e594-e599, 2021 12.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22990,""
"Quality of life of older adults in Peruvian Social Security during the COVID-19 pandemic","Objetive: To evaluate the quality of life of older adults who belong to the Seniors Centers (CAM) of the Social Security during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods: Data were collected through telephone calls to older adults aged 60 years and over in the CAM. Quality of life was assessed with the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, which considers the dimensions of mobility, self-care, activities of daily living, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression and an analog scale from 0 to 100. The presence of depression, anxiety, comorbidities and functional status were also measured. A bivariate analysis with nonparametric tests was performed to assess the association between covariates and the quality of life analog scale. In addition, a simple regression analysis was performed using generalized linear models of the Poisson family to evaluate variables associated with the presence of problems in the quality of life dimensions. Results: A total of 99 older adults participated, mostly women (84.9%) and with an average age of 73.1 years, 83.3% had a higher education level and 86.7% lived with their spouse. Older adults with obesity, lung disease, inability to manage their own money, feeling fatigued, and hearing problems reported a lower than average score (&lt;78.9) on the analogous quality of life scale. Osteoarticular diseases and feeling fatigued increase the likelihood of having problems with mobility, performing daily activities, and pain/discomfort.

"The Mental Health Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Care Workers and Coping Strategies: A Systematic Literature Review","In December 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. Since then, this virus has spread at a very rapid rate affecting many countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently declared a global pandemic, and a range of precautions have been implemented to reduce the spread of the virus. Some of these precautions included social distancing, selfisolation, and quarantine of those who have contracted or potentially contracted COVID-19. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk because of the constant contact with infected patients for extended periods or by exposure to a patient's environment or biological samples. This may cause fear of transmitting the infection to their families. Also, the extended working hours put them under severe stress, fatigue, and adverse social life. All of these factors affect their behaviors and attitudes. to explore the mental health impact of COVID-19 on HCWs as this will be reflected on their performance on such crisis. Besides, we aim to investigate HCWs' coping strategies during the pandemic and provide coping recommendations based on evidence. A systematic review using PRISMA methodology was used through three electronic databases, including PubMed, ScienceDi-rect, and Scopus. All cross-sectional studies that were published in English and that assessed the mental health impact of COVID-19 on HCWs or/and coping strategies adopted by them were included. A total of one hundred and forty articles total were retrieved from the three databases and were reviewed for relevance. reviews for relevance after remove duplicate. We Ended up with twenty-four recent studies from 2020 that were included in the analysis. As COVID-19 has started in China, our review identified many studies that were done there on the subject of HCWs mental health due to the crisis. Italy took the second place in the number of studies. Nurses and physicians were the populations targeted in many studies. COVID-19 has created much pressure on HCWs. This pressure has increased the following mental health complaints: anxiety, depression, insomnia, and stress. Many studies have emphasized the effects of social support as an effective way of coping with COVID-19. Â© 2021. All Rights Reserved.","Alaradi, A.; Irum, S.; Ebrahim, N.; Mohamed, F. M.

"Consultation-Liaison Telepsychiatry on an Inpatient Obstetrical Labor and Delivery Unit","BACKGROUND: Limited access to mental health resources has challenged clinicians in delivering early behavioral health interventions to perinatal populations. We describe telepsychiatry consultations to a rural hospital's labor and delivery unit. OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate how consultation-liaison services during peripartum hospitalization could meet this need. METHODS: One-year data from electronic medical records of women who were at risk of postpartum syndromes and offered a telepsychiatry consult was extracted and reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 85 consults were conducted via telepsychiatry primarily for depression, anxiety, and medication management. Bedside psychotherapeutic interventions and education were provided to 63 patients, medications were initiated for 32 patients, and outpatient referrals were made for 47 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that consultation-liaison telehealth can successfully engage at-risk mothers in psychiatric treatment. Given accelerated telemedicine efforts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, improving access to telepsychiatry for rural, peripartum populations is an important area of development.","Gopalan, Priya; Auster, Lauren; Brockman, Ida; Shenai, Neeta","https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.04.001","","Country: NL; HOLANDA; NETHERLANDS; PAISES BAJOS; THE NETHERLANDS; HOLLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry;62(6): 577-581, 2021.; Publication details: J Acad Consult Liaison Psychiatry;62(6): 577-581, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22994,""

"BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine Reactogenicity: The key role of immunity","We examined the impact of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2-specific cellular immunity on BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine reactogenicity. Of 96 healthcare workers (HCWs), 76% reported any vaccine reaction (first dose: 70%, second dose: 67%), none of which was severe. Following first dose, systemic reactions were significantly more frequent among HCWs with past infection than in infection-naÃ¯ve individuals, and among HCWs with pre-existing cellular immunity than in those without it. The rate of systemic reactions after second dose was 1.7 and 2.0-times higher than after first dose among infection-naÃ¯ve HCWs and those without pre-existing cellular immunity, respectively. Levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells before vaccination were higher in HCWs with systemic reactions after the first dose than in those without them. BNT162b2 vaccine reactogenicity after first dose is attributable to pre-existing cellular immunity elicited by prior COVID-19 or cross-reactivity. Reactogenicity following second dose suggests an immunity-boosting effect. Overall, these data may reduce negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines. Study Registration.

"High morbidity and mortality risk due to COVID-19 by smoked drug users","In much of the West, including Brazil, drug use has increased since social distancing began due to the pandemic. Use of smoked and modified drugs, and their impacts on health, may contribute to aggravate the pandemic. However, studies on the relationship between use of smoked drug and the new coronavirus are still scarce and have not received enough attention in global health recommendations. This paper aimed to briefly review the relationship between use of smoked drugs and acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2]. Recent studies also suggest that drug consumption increases the risk of contamination by SARS-CoV-2 and leads to worse prognosis, particularly drugs that affect lung functions. Use of smoked drugs, especially tobacco, is strongly associated with lung diseases that are risk factors for contamination by SARS-CoV-2. It is essential to develop strategies based on specific characteristics of drug users and for mental health professionals to be part of strategic teams. It is also necessary to invest in information campaigns regarding risks and prevention of harm caused by smoked drugs, as well as to design strategies that facilitate access to psychosocial treatment during the pandemic.","Volpatto, Borgonhi, Ornell, Bavaresco, Moura, Rabelo-da-Ponte, Kessler","https://doi.org/10.47626/2237-6089-2021-0290","20211130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22997,""
"Use of Telehealth Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: Experiences of Mental Health Providers Serving Rural Youth and Elderly in Pennsylvania","Stay-at-home orders and public health safety concerns precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic facilitated rapid changes in policy and reimbursement regulations and resulted in the sudden uptake of telehealth in mental health practices across the United States. This study explored how mental health service providers experienced the use of telehealth in serving their rural clients who are youth and older adults. A purposive sampling strategy was employed to identify and recruit mental health service providers and insurance agency representatives for this study. By means of online focus groups, this statewide study explored the experiences of 147 mental health and public insurance providers using telehealth to serve rural youth and elderly in Pennsylvania amid the pandemic in 2020. NVivo 12 qualitative analysis software was used in data analysis. The findings suggest that telehealth is perceived as both: silver linings during the pandemic (service continuation during the pandemic, improved parental involvement and responsiveness, easing the transportation challenges, and decrease in no-show rates) and some roadblocks to success (Not for every youth!, Technology challenges among the older adults, and ""Dead zones"" without internet and cellphone reception). Policy and practice recommendations are suggested including incentives for proactive telehealth uptake, telehealth parity laws and reimbursement policies, and incentivizing innovative use of technology for specific populations and therapeutic modalities. Continuous policy support and organizational efforts to provide customized telemental health are called for to remediate rural disparities in access to mental health services beyond the pandemic period.","Svistova, Harris, Fogarty, Kulp, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10488-021-01181-z","20211130","COVID-19; Elderly; Mental health services; Rural disparity; Telehealth; Youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",22998,""
"Psychological distress resulting from the COVID-19 confinement is associated with unhealthy dietary changes in two Italian population-based cohorts","To examine the relationship between psychological distress resulting from the COVID-19 lockdown and dietary changes. Cross-sectional analysis from 2 retrospective Italian cohorts recruited from May to September 2020: (1) The Moli-LOCK cohort consists of 1401 participants from the Moli-sani Study (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°24,325) who were administered a telephone-based questionnaire to assess lifestyles and psychological factors during confinement; (2) the ALT RISCOVID-19 is a web-based survey of 1340 individuals distributed throughout Italy who self-responded to the same questionnaire using GoogleÃ‚Â® forms. Psychological distress was measured by assessments of depression (PHQ-9 and depressive items from the Screening Questionnaire for Disaster Mental Health- SQD-D), anxiety (GAD-7), stress (PSS-4), and post-traumatic stress disorder (SQD-P). Diet quality was assessed either as changes in consumption of ultra-processed foods (UPF) or adherence to Mediterranean diet (MD). In ALT RISCOVID-19, increased UPF intake was directly associated with depression (both PHQ-9 and SQD-D; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), anxiety (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.0001), stress (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and SQD-P (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001); similar results were obtained in the Moli-LOCK cohort except for perceived stress. When psychometric scales were analysed simultaneously, only depression (SQD-D) remained associated with UPF (both cohorts). In both cohorts, psychological distress poorly influenced changes toward an MD, except for depression (SQD-D) that resulted inversely associated in the ALT RISCOVID-19 participants (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-Ã‚Â 0.16; 95% CI -Ã‚Â 0.26, -Ã‚Â 0.06). Psychological distress from the COVID-19 confinement is directly associated with unhealthy dietary modifications in two Italian cohorts.

Of 1,598 students who completed the baseline survey (S1), 836 students completed a follow-up survey 10 months after school resumption (S2). There were statistically significant differences in stress and mild anxiety between male and female students (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). Comparison of PSS-10, PHQ-9, and SAS scores by perceived impact of COVID-19 showed significant differences (Welch test, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.01). The correlation between PHQ-9 and SAS scores in school resumption and non-school resumption groups was relatively strong (adjusted R2 = 0.49 vs. 0.5). Multivariate linear regression showed that only PSS-10 (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.01) and SAS (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) scores significantly differed between returning and non-returning students.

The ongoing coronavirus pandemic has severely hampered the economy in a number of developing countries, resulting in a reduction in available research funding. The fallout of this will result in limiting educational institutes and small enterprises from using cutting edge biological techniques such as real-time PCR. Here, we report a cost-effective approach for preparing and assembling cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR mastermixes with similar efficiencies as commercially available kits. Our results thus demonstrate an alternative to commercially available kits.","Mote, Laxmikant, Singh, Tiwari, Singh, Srivastava, Tripathi, Seshadri, Majumdar, Subramanyam","https://www.google.com/search?q=A+cost-effective+and+efficient+approach+for+generating+and+assembling+reagents+for+conducting+real-time+PCR.","20211130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23006,""
"Impact of the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic on Mental Health among Local Residents in Korea: a Cross Sectional Study","This study aimed to evaluate traumatic stress and mental health problems associated with the prolonged coronavirus disease pandemic and to determine the differences across different age groups. A total of 1,151 individuals who visited Gwangmyeong City Mental Health Welfare Center, South Korea, or accessed the website from September 1 to December 31, 2020, were included in the study. Mental health problems such as traumatic stress (Primary Care Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Screen for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder-5); depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Children's Depression Inventory); anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Penn State Worry Questionnaire for Children); suicide risk (P4 Screener); and demographic information were evaluated. The participants were divided into three groups based on age group: children and adolescents, adults, and the elderly. The results showed that 24.7%, 20.9%, 16.8%, and 20.5% of the participants were at high-risk for traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and suicide, respectively. The difference in the proportion of high-risk groups by age of all participants was significant for traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, and suicide risk. In particular, the percentage of high-risk groups in all areas was the highest in the adult group. Also, in most areas, the ratio of the high-risk groups for children and adolescent group was the lowest, but the suicide risk-related ratio was not (adolescent group: 20.9%, adult group: 25%, elderly group 9.3%). These results suggest that there is a need for continued interest in the mental health of the general population even after the initial period of coronavirus disease. Additionally, this study may be helpful when considering the resilience or risk factors of mental health in a prolonged disaster situation.","Ko, Cho, Park, Chi, Han, Yi, Lee","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e322","20211130","Age Differences; Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Suicide Risk; Traumatic Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23007,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Mental Health of Adolescent Students in Daegu, Korea","In February 2020, as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spread rapidly in Daegu, South Korea, students in that region experienced many emotional difficulties. In this study, we analyzed the stress and emotional crisis experienced by students during the COVID-19 pandemic, its causative factors, and the factors that affect negative emotions. We identified the demographic information related to the experiences of unbearable stress and emotional crisis and their causal factors at three points in time: before the pandemic, during its peak, and at the time of the survey (2-3 months after the peak). In addition, we analyzed the factors related to depression and anxiety experienced by students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Korean version of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 and the Korean version of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 was used to assess for depressive and anxiety symptoms in the subject students, respectively. A total of 8,177 students participated in the analysis, with 4,072 boys (49.8%), 4,105 girls (50.2%), and 4,463 middle school students (54.6%) and 3,177 high school students (45.4%). The percentage of students who experienced unbearable stress was 9% before the COVID-19 pandemic, increased to 16% at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, then decreased to 12.7% at the time of the survey. Stress was experienced more by girls (18.1% versus 13.8% in boys; Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² = 28.159, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and high school students (19.0% versus 13.5% in middle school students; Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² = 45.437, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Overall, 7.6% experienced emotional crises during the COVID-19 pandemic, which was more prevalent in girls (10.1% versus 5.2% in boys; Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² = 71.025, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001) and in high school students (8.8% versus 6.7% in middle school students; Ãâ€¡Ã‚Â² = 12.996, <i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). Depression and anxiety was seen in 19.8% and 12.3% of students during the COVID-19 pandemic, respectively. The risk factors for depression and anxiety included unbearable stress before the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), mental health (<i>P</i> = 0.044), and age (<i>P</i> = 0.040), whereas resilience was identified as a protective factor for depression and anxiety (<i>P</i> = 0.001). Students in Daegu experienced lots of mental difficulties since the COVID-19 pandemic. It will be necessary to improve stress management and resilience to improve students' mental health in disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lee, Noh, Seo, Park, Kim, Won","https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2021.36.e321","20211130","Adolescents; COVID-19; Daegu; Mental Health; SARS-CoV-2; Students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23008,""
"Examining the association among fear of COVID-19, psychological distress, and delays in cancer care","Given the high risk of COVID-19 mortality, patients with cancer may be vulnerable to fear of COVID-19, adverse psychological outcomes, and health care delays. This longitudinal study surveyed the pandemic's impact on patients with cancer (N=Ã‚Â 1529) receiving Patient Advocate Foundation services during early and later pandemic. Generalized estimating equation with repeated measures was conducted to assess the effect of COVID-19 on psychological distress. Logistic regression with repeated measures was used to assess the effect of COVID-19 on any delays in accessing health care (e.g., specialty care doctors, laboratory, or diagnostic testing, etc.). Among 1199 respondents, 94% considered themselves high risk for COVID-19. Respondents with more fear of COVID-19 had a higher mean psychological distress score (10.21; 95% confidence intervals [CI] 9.38-11.03) compared to respondents with less fear (7.55; 95% CI 6.75-8.36). Additionally, 47% reported delaying care. Respondents with more fear of COVID-19 had higher percentages of delayed care than those with less (56; 95% CI 39%-72% vs. 44%; 95% CI 28%-61%). These relationships persisted throughout the pandemic. For respondents with a COVID-19 diagnosis in their household (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 116), distress scores were similar despite higher delays in care (58% vs. 27%) than those without COVID-19. Fear of COVID-19 is linked to psychological distress and delays in care among patients with cancer. Furthermore, those who are personally impacted see exacerbated cancer care delays. Timely psychosocial support and health care coordination are critical to meet increased care needs of patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Caston, Lawhon, Smith, Gallagher, Angove, Anderson, Balch, Azuero, Hung, Rocque","https://doi.org/10.1002/cam4.4391","20211130","COVID-19; COVID-19 fear; care disruption; mental health; oncology; psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23009,""
"Mental health outcomes and experiences of family caregivers of children with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Bolivia","This study examined whether certain demographic characteristics, caregiver strain, and coping behaviors were associated with the mental health outcomes of family caregivers of children with disabilities in Bolivia during the COVID-19 pandemic. A mixed-methods convergent study design was used with virtual interviews to quantitatively assess caregivers' demographic characteristics, caregiver strain, coping behaviors, and mental health outcomes, as well as qualitatively assess how the pandemic affected their family. Approximately 32%-71% of caregivers experienced poor mental health outcomes (stress, anxiety, and depression), especially among those experiencing poor health, high caregiver strain, and those using maladaptive coping strategies. Qualitative responses revealed that they experienced several unique stressors during the pandemic that affected them and their children.

"Sex in the Era of COVID-19 in a US National Cohort of Cisgender Men, Transgender Women, and Transgender Men Who Have Sex with Men: April-May 2020","Since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increasing body of research focused on the effects that measures like stay-at-home orders and social distancing are having on other aspects of health, including mental health and sexual health. Currently, there are limited extant data on the effects of the pandemic on sexual and gender minorities. Between April 15, 2020, and May 15, 2020, we invited participants in an ongoing U.S. national cohort study (Together 5000) to complete a cross-sectional online survey about the pandemic, and its effects on mental and sexual health and well-being (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3991). Nearly all (97.7%) were living in an area where they were told they should only leave their homes for essentials. Most (70.1%) reported reducing their number of sex partners as a result of the pandemic. Among the 789 participants prescribed HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), 29.9% said they stopped taking their PrEP entirely, and 14.2% started selectively skipping doses. For those who had been taking PrEP, discontinuing PrEP was associated with having no new sex partners (ÃŽÂ²Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.90, 95% CI 0.40-1.40). Among the 152 HIV-positive participants, 30.9% said they were unable to maintain an HIV-related medical appointment because of the pandemic and 13.8% said they had been unable to retrieve HIV medications. Additionally, 35.3% of participants were experiencing moderate to severe anxiety because of the pandemic and 36.7% reported symptoms of depression. In a multivariable logistic regression, reporting a new sex partner in the prior 30Ã‚Â days was significantly associated with being aged 30 or older (vs. not, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.21), being Black (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.79) or Latinx (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.40, vs. white), and being unsure if they had been in close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 (AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.32, vs. no contact). It was unassociated with COVID-19-induced anxiety, depression, or knowing someone hospitalized with COVID-19. The pandemic has caused disruptions in sexual behavior (partner reduction) as well as difficulties navigating PrEP and HIV care continua. Findings will guide more comprehensive public health responses to optimize HIV prevention and treatment in the era of COVID-19.","Grov, Zohra, Westmoreland, Mirzayi, D'Angelo, Stief, Kulkarni, Nash, Carrico","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10508-021-02121-6","20211130","COVID-19; HIV care; Mental health; Pre-exposure prophylaxis; Sexual and gender minorities; Sexual behavior; Transgender","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23011,""

"Identifying disease-critical cell types and cellular processes across the human body by integration of single-cell profiles and human genetics","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. Here, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average <i>N=</i> 297K). Cell type, disease progression, and cellular process programs captured distinct heritability signals even within the same cell type, as we show in multiple complex diseases that affect the brain (AlzheimerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s disease, multiple sclerosis), colon (ulcerative colitis) and lung (asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, severe COVID-19). The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted novel cell-disease relationships, including GABAergic neurons in major depressive disorder (MDD), a disease progression M cell program in ulcerative colitis, and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease progression immune cell type programs were associated, whereas for epithelial cells, disease progression programs were most prominent, perhaps suggesting a role in disease progression over initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.","Jagadeesh, Dey, Montoro, Mohan, Gazal, Engreitz, Xavier, Price, Regev","https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.19.436212","20211130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23013,""
"Postpartum Depressive Symptoms and Experiences During COVID-19","Purpose: To identify postpartum depression risk and describe experiences of women in the first 6 weeks after giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.Study Design and Methods: Using a convergent mixed-methods approach, we recruited a convenience sample of women living in the United States who gave birth March 1, 2020 or later from social media Web sites. Participants completed the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-Short Form and provided written answers to open-ended questions regarding their experiences at home with their new infant.Results: Our 262 participants were on average 32.6 years of age, the majority were White (82%), married or partnered (91.9%), and college educated (87.4%). Mean postpartum depression score was 17.7 (SD = 5.9) with 75% scoring Ã¢â€°Â¥14, indicating significant postpartum depressive symptoms. Qualitative content analysis revealed five themes: Isolation and seclusion continue; Fear, anxiety, and stress filled the days; Grieving the loss of normal: It's just so sad; Complicated by postpartum depression: A dark time; and There is a silver lining. Quantitative and qualitative findings provided a holistic view of women's depressive symptoms and experiences at home with their infants during the COVID-19 pandemic.Clinical Implications: Although policies that reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection for patients and the health care team must continue to be implemented, the adverse effects of depressive symptoms on maternal-infant wellbeing within the context of increased isolation due to the pandemic need to be kept at the forefront.

"Perinatal Experiences of Asian American Women During COVID-19","Purpose: To explore the wellbeing and pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum experiences of Asian American women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic.Study Design: Qualitative exploratory design.Methods: Using convenience and snowball sampling, we recruited Asian American women who gave birth during the COVID-19 pandemic via social media. Participants completed sociodemographic and depressive symptom questionnaires and took part in a virtual semistructured interview where they were asked to describe their pregnancy, birth, and postpartum experiences in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative content analysis methods were used to identify themes from participant narratives.Results: Thirty-eight Asian American women representing several racial ethnic subgroups (Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Hmong, Laotian, Vietnamese) participated in our study. Participants were on average 34 (SD = 3.5) years of age; the majority were married and lived in California. At the time of data collection, participants were 3.7 (SD = 2.07) months postpartum and 5.3 to 10.5 months into the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative content analysis revealed two main themes: 1) unexpected perinatal journey, and 2) the emotional and psychological consequences of COVID-19.Clinical Implications: Our findings are not unique to Asian American women, but they offer insight for nurses taking care of all childbearing women. Nurses can provide individually tailored anticipatory guidance to help women navigate perinatal changes to help them manage expectations during future public health crises. Nurses can also encourage and help perinatal women find ways to increase their own social support networks during the pregnancy and postpartum period.","Goyal, Han, Feldman-Schwartz, Le","https://doi.org/10.1097/NMC.0000000000000796","20211130","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23015,""

As such, the impact of COVID-19 on drug overdose-related deaths was examined through a systematic review of the literature and percentage change analyses of surveillance data. Systematic searches in electronic databases were conducted, a topical issue brief and bibliography were reviewed, reference lists of included studies were searched and expert consultations were held to identify studies (Registration # CRD42021230223). Observational studies from the United States and Canada were eligible for inclusion if drug overdose-related deaths were assessed in quantitative or qualitative analyses onwards from at least March 2020. In addition, percentage changes comparing drug overdose-related deaths in the second annual quarter (Q2 2020 [April to June]) with the first annual quarter (Q1 2020 [January to March]) were generated using national and subnational data from public health surveillance systems and reports from jurisdictions in the United States and Canada. Nine studies were included in the systematic review, eight from the United States and one from Canada. The maximum outcome assessment period in the included studies extended until September 2020. Drug overdose-related deaths after the onset of COVID-19 were higher compared with the months leading up to the pandemic in 2020 and the comparative months in 2019. In additional percentage change analyses, drug overdose-related deaths increased by 2 to 60% in jurisdictions in the United States and by 58% in Canada when comparing Q2 2020 with Q1 2020. Drug overdose-related deaths increased after the onset of COVID-19.

"Within- and across-day patterns of interplay between depressive symptoms and related psychopathological processes: a dynamic network approach during the COVID-19 pandemic","In order to understand the intricate patterns of interplay connected to the formation and maintenance of depressive symptomatology, repeated measures investigations focusing on within-person relationships between psychopathological mechanisms and depressive components are required. This large-scale preregistered intensive longitudinal study conducted 68,240 observations of 1706 individuals in the general adult population across a 40-day period during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify the detrimental processes involved in depressive states. Daily responses were modeled using multi-level dynamic network analysis to investigate the temporal associations across days, in addition to contemporaneous relationships between depressive components within a daily window. Among the investigated psychopathological mechanisms, helplessness predicted the strongest across-day influence on depressive symptoms, while emotion regulation difficulties displayed more proximal interactions with symptomatology. Helplessness was further involved in the amplification of other theorized psychopathological mechanisms including rumination, the latter of which to a greater extent was susceptible toward being influenced rather than temporally influencing other components of depressive states. Distinctive symptoms of depression behaved differently, with depressed mood and anhedonia most prone to being impacted, while lethargy and worthlessness were more strongly associated with outgoing activity in the network. The main mechanism predicting the amplifications of detrimental symptomatology was helplessness. Lethargy and worthlessness revealed greater within-person carry-over effects across days, providing preliminary indications that these symptoms may be more strongly associated with pushing individuals toward prolonged depressive state experiences. The psychopathological processes of rumination, helplessness, and emotion regulation only exhibited interactions with the depressed mood and worthlessness component of depression, being unrelated to lethargy and anhedonia. The findings have implications for the impediment of depressive symptomatology during and beyond the pandemic period. They further outline the gaps in the literature concerning the identification of psychopathological processes intertwined with lethargy and anhedonia on the within-person level.","Ebrahimi, Burger, Hoffart, Johnson","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02179-y","20211130","COVID-19 pandemic; Depression; Dynamic network analysis; General adult population; Longitudinal study; Nomothetic time series analysis; Psychopathological mechanisms","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-01","",23018,""
"The role of sex and gender in the changing levels of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","Several studies have assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anxiety and depression, but have not focused on the role of sex and gender. This study compared changes in the levels of anxiety and depression (pre- and post-COVID) experienced by individuals of various sexes and genders. We used a cross-sectional online survey that assessed pre- and post-COVID symptoms of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2) and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). General linear modeling (fixed model factorial analysis of variance) was used to evaluate changes in anxiety and depression between pre- and post-pandemic periods and explore differential effects of sex and gender on those changes. Our study included 1847 participants from 43 countries and demonstrated a percentage increase of 57.1% and 74.2% in anxiety and depression, respectively. For the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-2 scale (maximum score 6), there was a mean increase in anxiety by sex for male, female, and other of 1.0, 1.2, and 1.4, respectively; and by gender for man, woman, and others of 0.9, 1.3, and 1.6, respectively. For the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (maximum score 27), there was a mean increase in depressive symptoms by sex for male, female, and other of 3.6, 4.7, and 5.5 respectively; and by gender for man, woman, and others of 3.3, 4.8, and 6.5, respectively.
