"Mental Health, Substance Use, and Suicidal Ideation Among Unpaid Caregivers in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Relationships to Age, Race/Ethnicity, Employment, and Caregiver Intensity","ObjectivesTo estimate the prevalence of unpaid caregiving during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and to identify factors associated with adverse mental health symptoms, substance use, and suicidal ideation in this population, which provides critical support in health care systems by providing care to older adults and those with chronic conditions.

MethodsIn June 2020, Internet-based surveys with questions about demographics, caregiving responsibilities, and mental health were administered to US adults aged [&ge;]18 years. Demographic quota sampling and survey weighting to improve cross-sectional sample representativeness of age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence ratios for adverse mental health symptoms were estimated using multivariable Poisson regressions.

ResultsOf 9,896 eligible invited adults, 5,412 (54.7%) completed surveys; 5,011 (92.6%) respondents met screening criteria and were analysed, including 1,362 (27.2%) caregivers. Caregivers had higher prevalences of adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers, including anxiety or depressive disorder symptoms (57.6% vs 21.5%, respectively, p<0.0001) having recently seriously considered suicide (33.4% vs 3.7%, p<0.0001). Symptoms were more common among caregivers who were young vs older adults (e.g., aged 18-24 vs [&ge;]65 years, aPR 2.75, 95% CI 1.95-3.88, p<0.0001), Hispanic or Latino vs non-Hispanic White (1.14, 1.04-1.25, p=0.0044), living with vs without disabilities (1.18, 1.10-1.26, p<0.0001), and with moderate and high vs low Caregiver Intensity Index scores (2.31, 1.65-3.23; 2.81, 2.00-3.94; both p<0.0001). Suicidal ideation was more prevalent among non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White caregivers (1.48, 1.15-1.90, p=0.0022).

ConclusionsCaregivers, who accounted for one in four US adult respondents in this nationally representative sample, more commonly reported adverse mental health symptoms than non-caregivers. Increased visibility of and access to mental health care resources are urgently needed to address mental health challenges of caregiving.","Mark Ã‰ Czeisler; Alexandra Drane; Sarah S.

"HEALTHCARE WORKERS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS At EARLY PHASE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN MOROCCO","The mental being of healthcare workers with the COVID 19 pandemic is a determinant of their resilience. We investigated the psychological impact of healthcare workers during novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV times in Morocco.

A cross-sectional study conducted among healthcare workers of an University Hospital. We evaluated the knowledge of the protective means against nCov-19, incidence and the degree of anxiety and depression according to health workers characteristic.

Among 287 health workers; 54% have been trained regarding protection procedures, and 94.8% declared that they are aware of individual protection measures. The incidence of anxiety and depression was respectively 77.4% and 73.9%. High degree of anxiety and depression was associated with female gender. However, Higher degree of anxiety was also related to function, specialty of practice, and knowledge of the protective measures against COVID-19.","Jihane Belayachi; Sarah Benammi; Hasnae CHIPPO; Rhita Nechba BENNIS; Naoufel Madani; Abdelmalek Hrora; Redouane Abouqal","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.02.21250639","20210205","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10336,""
"Risk Factors for Infection and Health Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic in People with Autoimmune Diseases","BackgroundPeople with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions who take immunomodulatory/suppressive medications may have a higher risk of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Chronic disease care has also changed for many patients, with uncertain downstream consequences.

ObjectiveAssess whether COVID-19 risk is higher among those on immunomodulating or suppressive agents and characterize pandemic-associated changes to care.

DesignLongitudinal registry study

Participants4666 individuals with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions followed by specialists in neurology, rheumatology, cardiology, pulmonology or gastroenterology at Johns Hopkins

MeasurementsPeriodic surveys querying comorbidities, disease-modifying medications, exposures, COVID-19 testing and outcomes, social behaviors, and disruptions to healthcare

ResultsA total of 265 (5.6%) developed COVID-19 over 9 months of follow-up (April-December 2020). Patient characteristics (age, race, comorbidity, medication exposure) were associated with differences in social distancing behaviors during the pandemic. Glucocorticoid exposure was associated with higher odds of COVID-19 in multivariable models incorporating behavior and other potential confounders (OR: 1.43; 95%CI: 1.08, 1.89). Other medication classes were not associated with COVID-19 risk. Diabetes (OR: 1.72; 95%CI: 1.08, 2.73), cardiovascular disease (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24, 2.28), and chronic kidney disease (OR: 1.76; 95%CI: 1.04, 2.97) were each associated with higher odds of COVID-19. Pandemic-related disruption to care was common. Of the 2156 reporting pre-pandemic utilization of infusion, mental health or rehabilitative services, 975 (45.2%) reported disruptions. Individuals experiencing changes to employment or income were at highest odds of care disruption.

LimitationsResults may not be generalizable to all patients with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Information was self-reported.

ConclusionsExposure to glucocorticoids may increase risk of COVID-19 in people with autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Disruption to healthcare and related services was common. Those with pandemic-related reduced income may be most vulnerable to care disruptions.","Kathryn C Fitzgerald; Christopher A Mecoli; Morgan Douglas; Samantha Harris; Berna Aravidis; Jemima Albayda; Ahmet Hoke; Elias S Sotirchos; Ana-Maria Orbai; Michelle Petri; Lisa Christopher-Stine; Alan N Baer; Julie J Paik; Brittany L Adler; Eleni Tiniakou; Homa Timlin; Pavan Bhargava; Scott D Newsome; Arun Venkatesan; Vinay Chaudhry; Thomas E Lloyd; Carlos A Pardo; Barney J Stern; Mark Lazarev; Brindusa Truta; Shiv Saidha; Edward S Chen; Michelle Sharp; Nisha Gilotra; Edward K Kasper; Allan C Gelber; Clifton O Bingham III; Ami A Shah; Ellen M Mowry","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.02.03.21251069","20210205","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10337,""

"Trends in US Emergency Department Visits for Mental Health, Overdose, and Violence Outcomes Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Importance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, associated mitigation measures, and social and economic impacts may affect mental health, suicidal behavior, substance use, and violence. Objective: To examine changes in US emergency department (ED) visits for mental health conditions (MHCs), suicide attempts (SAs), overdose (OD), and violence outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Syndromic Surveillance Program to examine national changes in ED visits for MHCs, SAs, ODs, and violence from December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020 (before and during the COVID-19 pandemic). The National Syndromic Surveillance Program captures approximately 70% of US ED visits from more than 3500 EDs that cover 48 states and Washington, DC. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcome measures were MHCs, SAs, all drug ODs, opioid ODs, intimate partner violence (IPV), and suspected child abuse and neglect (SCAN) ED visit counts and rates. Weekly ED visit counts and rates were computed overall and stratified by sex. Results: From December 30, 2018, to October 10, 2020, a total of 187Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯508Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯065 total ED visits (53.6% female and 46.1% male) were captured; 6Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯018Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯318 included at least 1 study outcome (visits not mutually exclusive). Total ED visit volume decreased after COVID-19 mitigation measures were implemented in the US beginning on March 16, 2020. Weekly ED visit counts for all 6 outcomes decreased between March 8 and 28, 2020 (March 8: MHCs = 42Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯903, SAs = 5212, all ODs = 14Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯543, opioid ODs = 4752, IPV = 444, and SCAN = 1090; March 28: MHCs = 17Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯574, SAs = 4241, all ODs = 12Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯399, opioid ODs = 4306, IPV = 347, and SCAN = 487). Conversely, ED visit rates increased beginning the week of March 22 to 28, 2020. When the median ED visit counts between March 15 and October 10, 2020, were compared with the same period in 2019, the 2020 counts were significantly higher for SAs (n = 4940 vs 4656, P = .02), all ODs (n = 15Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯604 vs 13Ã¢<U+0080>Â¯371, P < .001), and opioid ODs (n = 5502 vs 4168, P < .001); counts were significantly lower for IPV ED visits (n = 442 vs 484, P < .001) and SCAN ED visits (n = 884 vs 1038, P < .001). Median rates during the same period were significantly higher in 2020 compared with 2019 for all outcomes except IPV. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ED care seeking shifts during a pandemic, underscoring the need to integrate mental health, substance use, and violence screening and prevention services into response activities during public health crises.","Holland, Kristin M; Jones, Christopher; Vivolo-Kantor, Alana M; Idaikkadar, Nimi; Zwald, Marissa; Hoots, Brooke; Yard, Ellen; D'Inverno, Ashley; Swedo, Elizabeth; Chen, May S; Petrosky, Emiko; Board, Amy; Martinez, Pedro; Stone, Deborah M; Law, Royal; Coletta, Michael A; Adjemian, Jennifer; Thomas, Craig; Puddy, Richard W; Peacock, Georgina; Dowling, Nicole F; Houry, Debra","https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2020.4402","","Country: US; ESTADOS UNIDOS; UNITED STATES; ESTADOS UNIDOS; USA; EUA; US; UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; ESTADOS UNIDOS DA AMERICA; EEUU; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JAMA Psychiatry;2021 Feb 03.; Publication details: JAMA Psychiatry;2021 Feb 03.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10359,""
"The immediate psychological response of the general population in Saudi Arabia during COVID-19 pandemic: A cross-sectional study","The outbreak of COVID-19 may differentially exacerbate anxiety and stress in people subjected to the real or perceived threat of the virus. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out to assess the general population's psychological response during the initial state of the outbreak in Saudi Arabia. The study used brief screening tools PHQ-4 for anxiety-depression symptoms and IES-6 for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Among the 584 respondents, 19.8% and 22.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and depression symptoms respectively. According to the combined PHQ-4 score, 14.5% of participants showed moderate to severe anxiety or depression disorder. Overall, 64.8% met the level of clinical concern for posttraumatic stress disorder and 51.3% met the level of probable posttraumatic stress disorder diagnosis. Multivariate analyses showed that females, non-Saudi nationalities, and those who had a history of mental illness were more vulnerable to anxiety and depression disorders than their counterparts, whereas a higher prevalence of distress symptoms was reported among those who prefer Arabic over English for communication. It was found that people whose colleagues or family infected with the disease were more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression and distress. The study further showed that the higher the perceived threat, the higher the chances of exhibiting anxiety-depressive disorder symptoms and distress symptoms. The findings might be a matter for serious concern, and considerable attention is required from authorities and policymakers regarding early detection and treatment of these illnesses in order to reduce the burden of the pandemic related mental illness.","Joseph, Lucca, Alshayban, Alshehry","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jiph.2020.11.017","20210206","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Mental health; Posttraumatic stress disorder; Saudi Arabia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10360,""

"Pandemic nightmares: Effects on dream activity of the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy","COVID-19 has critically impacted the world. Recent works have found substantial changes in sleep and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dreams could give us crucial information about people's well-being, so here we have directly investigated the consequences of lockdown on the oneiric activity in a large Italian sample: 5,988 adults completed a web-survey during lockdown. We investigated sociodemographic and COVID-19-related information, sleep quality (by the Medical Outcomes Study-Sleep Scale), mental health (by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales), dream and nightmare frequency, and related emotional aspects (by the Mannheim Dream Questionnaire). Comparisons between our sample and a population-based sample revealed that Italians are having more frequent nightmares and dreams during the pandemic. A multiple logistic regression model showed the predictors of high dream recall (young age, female gender, not having children, sleep duration) and high nightmare frequency (young age, female gender, modification of napping, sleep duration, intrasleep wakefulness, sleep problem index, anxiety, depression). Moreover, we found higher emotional features of dream activity in workers who have stopped working, in people who have relatives/friends infected by or who have died from COVID-19 and in subjects who have changed their sleep habits. Our findings point to the fact that the predictors of high dream recall and nightmares are consistent with the continuity between sleep mentation and daily experiences. According to the arousal-retrieval model, we found that poor sleep predicts a high nightmare frequency. We suggest monitoring dream changes during the epidemic, and also considering the implications for clinical treatment and prevention of mental and sleep disorders.","Scarpelli, Alfonsi, Mangiaruga, Musetti, Quattropani, Lenzo, Freda, Lemmo, Vegni, Borghi, Saita, Cattivelli, Castelnuovo, Plazzi, De Gennaro, Franceschini","https://doi.org/10.1111/jsr.13300","20210206","adverse events; continuity hypothesis; health; mental sleep activity; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10364,""

"COVID-19 Pandemic: Changes in Care for a Community Academic Breast Center and Patient Perception of Those Changes","Philadelphia and its suburbs were an epicenter for the initial COVID-19 outbreak. Accordingly, alterations were made in breast cancer care at a community hospital. The authors developed a prospective database of all the patients with invasive or in situ breast cancer between March 1 and June 15 at their breast center. Any change in a breast cancer plan due to the pandemic was documented, and the patients were grouped into two cohorts according to whether a change was made (CTX) or no change was made (NC) in their care. The patients were asked a series of questions about their care, including those in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder two-item questionnaire (GAD-2), via telephone. The study enrolled 73 patients: 41 NC patients (56%) and 32 CTX patients (44%). The two cohorts did not differ in terms of age, race, or stage. Changes included delay in therapy (15.1%) and use of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET, 28.8%). The median time to surgery was 24Ã‚Â days (interequartile range [IQR], 16-45Ã‚Â days) for the NC patients and 82Ã‚Â day s (IQR, 52-98Ã‚Â days) for the CTX patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¤Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). The median duration of NET was 78Ã‚Â days. The GAD-2 showed anxiety positivity to be 29.6% for the CTX patients and 32.4% for the NC patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.00). More than half (55.6%) of the CTX patients believed COVID-19 affected their treatment outlook compared with 25.7% of the NC patients (pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.021). A prospective database captured changes in breast cancer care at a community academic breast center during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. 44% of patients experienced a change in breast cancer care due to COVID-19.

"Prospective prediction of PTSD and depressive symptoms during social unrest and COVID-19 using a brief online tool","Large-scale protracted population stressors, such as social unrest and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are associated with increased symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Cost-effective mental health screening is prerequisite for timely intervention. We developed an online tool to identify prospective predictors of PTSD and depressive symptoms in the context of co-occurring social unrest and COVID-19 in Hong Kong. 150 participants completed baseline and follow-up assessments, with a median duration of 29 days. Three logistic regression models were constructed to assess its discriminative power in predicting PTSD and depressive symptoms at one month. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis was performed for each model to determine their optimal decision thresholds. Sensitivity and specificity of the models were 87.1% and 53.8% for probable PTSD, 77.5% and 63.3% for high-risk depressive symptoms, and 44.7% and 96.4% for no significant depressive symptoms. The models performed well in discriminating outcomes (AUCs range: 0.769-0.811). Probable PTSD was predicted by social unrest-related traumatic events, high rumination, and low resilience. Rumination and resilience also predicted high-risk and no significant depressive symptoms, with COVID-19-related events also predicting no significant depression risk. Accessible screening of probable mental health outcomes with good predictive capability may be important for early intervention opportunities.","Wong, Hui, Wong, Suen, Chan, Lee, Chang, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113773","20210205","COVID-19; Depressive symptoms; Mass screening; PTSD symptoms; Risk assessment; Trauma exposure","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10369,""

We evaluated the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle and emotional state in women planning infertility treatments. We performed a quantitative research study using a web-based survey, in 140 women referred to Assisted Reproductive Technologies Center. We observed changes in body weight during lockdown in 80 % of women, and a significant increase in BMI in comparison to that observed before (p=.001). We observed a high percentage of non-adherence to the Mediterranean pattern during lockdown due to higher frequency of consumption of sweet/pastries, cheese and meat, rather than fruit, vegetables and legumes. Before lockdown 36.4 % women were snack consumers while during lockdown 55 % (p=.002). By considering individuals' attitude to snack consumption, we observed an increase related to boredom (p=&lt;.0001) and anxiety (p=.05) during lockdown. Increased levels of anxiety and sadness were observed in about 30 %, and of boredom in 25 %. The percentage of women worried about their planning infertility treatment was more than 50 %.

"Transmission of COVID-19 in 282 clusters in Catalonia, Spain: a cohort study","Scarce data are available on what variables affect the risk of transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the development of symptomatic COVID-19, and, particularly, the relationship with viral load. We aimed to analyse data from linked index cases of COVID-19 and their contacts to explore factors associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. In this cohort study, patients were recruited as part of a randomised controlled trial done between March 17 and April 28, 2020, that aimed to assess if hydroxychloroquine reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Patients with COVID-19 and their contacts were identified by use of the electronic registry of the Epidemiological Surveillance Emergency Service of Catalonia (Spain). Patients with COVID-19 included in our analysis were aged 18 years or older, not hospitalised, had quantitative PCR results available at baseline, had mild symptom onset within 5 days before enrolment, and had no reported symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infections in their accommodation or workplace within the 14 days before enrolment. Contacts included were adults with a recent history of exposure and absence of COVID-19-like symptoms within the 7 days preceding enrolment. Viral load of contacts, measured by quantitative PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab, was assessed at enrolment, at day 14, and whenever the participant reported COVID-19-like symptoms. We assessed risk of transmission and developing symptomatic disease and incubation dynamics using regression analysis. We assessed the relationship of viral load and characteristics of cases (age, sex, number of days from reported symptom onset, and presence or absence of fever, cough, dyspnoea, rhinitis, and anosmia) and associations between risk of transmission and characteristics of the index case and contacts. We identified 314 patients with COVID-19, with 282 (90%) having at least one contact (753 contacts in total), resulting in 282 clusters. 90 (32%) of 282 clusters had at least one transmission event. The secondary attack rate was 17% (125 of 753 contacts), with a variation from 12% when the index case had a viral load lower than 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>6</sup> copies per mL to 24% when the index case had a viral load of 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>10</sup> copies per mL or higher (adjusted odds ratio per log<sub>10</sub> increase in viral load 1Ã‚Â·3, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·1-1Ã‚Â·5). Increased risk of transmission was also associated with household contact (3Ã‚Â·0, 1Ã‚Â·59-5Ã‚Â·65) and age of the contact (per year: 1Ã‚Â·02, 1Ã‚Â·01-1Ã‚Â·04). 449 contacts had a positive PCR result at baseline. 28 (6%) of 449 contacts had symptoms at the first visit. Of 421 contacts who were asymptomatic at the first visit, 181 (43%) developed symptomatic COVID-19, with a variation from approximately 38% in contacts with an initial viral load lower than 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>7</sup> copies per mL to greater than 66% for those with an initial viral load of 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>10</sup> copies per mL or higher (hazard ratio per log<sub>10</sub> increase in viral load 1Ã‚Â·12, 95% CI 1Ã‚Â·05-1Ã‚Â·20; p=0Ã‚Â·0006). Time to onset of symptomatic disease decreased from a median of 7 days (IQR 5-10) for individuals with an initial viral load lower than 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>7</sup> copies per mL to 6 days (4-8) for those with an initial viral load between 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>7</sup> and 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>9</sup> copies per mL, and 5 days (3-8) for those with an initial viral load higher than 1Ã¢â‚¬Ë†Ãƒâ€”Ã¢â‚¬Ë†10<sup>9</sup> copies per mL. In our study, the viral load of index cases was a leading driver of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

"Socio-ecological predictors of mental health outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States","Healthcare workers are at increased risk of adverse mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies are warranted that examine socio-ecological factors associated with these outcomes to inform interventions that support healthcare workers during future disease outbreaks. We conducted an online cross-sectional study of healthcare workers during May 2020 to assess the socio-ecological predictors of mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We assessed factors at four socio-ecological levels: individual (e.g., gender), interpersonal (e.g., social support), institutional (e.g., personal protective equipment availability), and community (e.g., healthcare worker stigma). The Personal Health Questionnaire-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, Primary Care Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Concise scales assessed probable major depression (MD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess unadjusted and adjusted associations between socio-ecological factors and mental health outcomes. Of the 1,092 participants, 72.0% were female, 51.9% were frontline workers, and the mean age was 40.4 years (standard deviation = 11.5). Based on cut-off scores, 13.9%, 15.6%, 22.8%, and 42.8% had probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD, respectively. In the multivariable adjusted models, needing more social support was associated with significantly higher odds of probable MD, GAD, PTSD, and AUD. The significance of other factors varied across the outcomes. For example, at the individual level, female gender was associated with probable PTSD. At the institutional level, lower team cohesion was associated with probable PTSD, and difficulty following hospital policies with probable MD. At the community level, higher healthcare worker stigma was associated with probable PTSD and AUD, decreased satisfaction with the national government response with probable GAD, and higher media exposure with probable GAD and PTSD. These findings can inform targeted interventions that promote healthcare workers' psychological resilience during disease outbreaks.","Hennein, Mew, Lowe","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0246602","20210205","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10372,""

"COVID-19 and geriatric population: from pathophysiology to clinical perspectives","The COVID-19 pandemic has not only led to a worldwide socio-economic depression, but has also had theÃ‚Â highest health impact on the geriatric population.

This is because of many reasons which include the atypical presentation in the geriatric population which might haveÃ‚Â led to diagnostic delay. As per the WHO guidelines to perform RT-PCR only on the symptomatic individuals, a very small portion of individuals were tested, leaving a fraction ofÃ‚Â population undiagnosed. Therefore, there remained a chance that many asymptomatic individuals such caregivers,Ã‚Â healthcare professionals, family members were undiagnosedÃ‚Â and might have carried this virus to the geriatric patients. Also, many countries were not prepared to handle the burden on their healthcare system which included sudden increased demand of ICU beds, mechanical ventilation etc. As a result, they had to make decision onÃ‚Â who to be admitted.

"The association between witnessing patient death and mental health outcomes in frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers","Healthcare workers (HCW) treating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients face high levels of psychological stress. We aimed to compare mental health outcomes, risk and protective factors for posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), probable depression, and anxiety between HCW working in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 wards. A self-report survey, administered in a large tertiary hospital in Israel during the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak was completed by 828 HCW (42.2% physicians, 57.8% nurses. Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System; the Patient Health Questionnaire-9; the Primary Care-Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Screen for DSM-5 (PC-PTSD-5) were used for assessing anxiety, depression, and PTSS, respectively. Pandemic-related stress factors, negative experiences, and potential protective factors were also assessed. Median PC-PTSD scores differed significantly between study teams (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> [5]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.24; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004). Prevalence of probable depression and anxiety were similar in both groups. Risk factors for mental health outcomes included mental exhaustion, anxiety about being infected and infecting family. Overall, higher proportion of the COVID-19 team witnessed patient deaths as compared to the non-COVID-19 team (50.2% vs. 24.7%). Witnessing patient death at the COVID-19 wards was associated with a four-fold increased likelihood of PTSS (odds ratio [OR]Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58-9.99; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.0007), compared with the non-COVID-19 wards (OR 0.91; 95% CI, 0.51-1.61; pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.43). Witnessing patient death appears to be a risk factor for PTSS unique to HCW directly engaged in treating patients with COVID-19.

Parents and adolescents provided ratings of mental health symptoms shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic and in spring and summer 2020. Adolescents on average experienced an increase in depression, anxiety, sluggish cognitive tempo, inattentive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms from pre-COVID-19 to spring 2020; however, with the exception of inattention, these symptoms decreased from spring to summer 2020. Adolescents with ADHD were more likely than adolescents without ADHD to experience an increase in inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, and oppositional/defiant symptoms. Adolescents with poorer pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities were at-risk for experiencing increases in all mental health symptoms relative to adolescents with better pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities. Interactive risk based on ADHD status and pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation abilities was found for inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity, such that adolescents with ADHD and poor pre-COVID-19 emotion regulation displayed the highest symptomatology across timepoints. Lower family income related to increases in inattention but higher family income related to increases in oppositional/defiant symptoms. The early observed increases in adolescent mental health symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic do not on average appear to be sustained following the lift of stay-at-home orders, though studies evaluating mental health across longer periods of time are needed. Emotion dysregulation and ADHD increase risk for sustained negative mental health functioning and highlight the need for interventions for these populations during chronic stressors. Results and clinical implications should be considered within the context of our predominately White, middle class sample.","Breaux, Dvorsky, Marsh, Green, Cash, Shroff, Buchen, Langberg, Becker","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13382","20210205","COVID-19; Novel coronavirus; adolescence; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; emotion regulation; mental health; psychopathology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10379,""
"Mitigating SARS-CoV-2 Transmission in Hispanic and Latino Communities-Prince William Health District, Virginia, June 2020","To identify factors contributing to disproportionate rates of COVID-19 among Hispanic or Latino persons in Prince William Health District, Virginia, and to identify measures to better engage Hispanic and Latino communities in COVID-19 mitigation. Data collection proceeded via three methods in June 2020: a quantitative survey of Hispanic or Latino residents, key informant interviews with local leaders familiar with this population, and focus group discussions with Hispanic or Latino community members. Those who worked outside the home, lived in larger households, or lived with someone who had tested positive were more likely to report testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (unadjusted odds ratios of 2.5, 1.2, and 12.9, respectively). Difficulty implementing COVID-19 prevention practices (reported by 46% of survey respondents), immigration-related fears (repeatedly identified in qualitative data), and limited awareness of local COVID-19 resources (57% of survey respondents spoke little or no English) were identified. Survey respondents also reported declines in their food security (25%) and mental health (25%). Specific attention to the needs of Hispanic or Latino communities could help reduce the burden of COVID-19. The investigation methods can also be used by other jurisdictions to evaluate the needs of and services provided to diverse underserved populations.","Davlantes, Tippins, Espinosa, Lofgren, Leonard, Solis, Young, Sockwell, Ansher","https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-00968-y","20210207","COVID-19; Hispanic; Latino; Spanish","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10380,""

"Age and frailty are independently associated with increased COVID-19 mortality and increased care needs in survivors: results of an international multi-centre study","Increased mortality has been demonstrated in older adults with COVID-19, but the effect of frailty has been unclear. This multi-centre cohort study involved patients aged 18Ã‚Â years and older hospitalised with COVID-19, using routinely collected data. We used Cox regression analysis to assess the impact of age, frailty, and delirium on the risk of inpatient mortality, adjusting for sex, illness severity, inflammation, and co-morbidities. We used ordinal logistic regression analysis to assess the impact of age, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), and delirium on risk of increased care requirements on discharge, adjusting for the same variables. Data from 5,711 patients from 55 hospitals in 12 countries were included (median age 74, IQR 54-83; 55.2% male). The risk of death increased independently with increasing age (&gt;80 vs 18-49: HR 3.57, CI 2.54-5.02), frailty (CFS 8 vs 1-3: HR 3.03, CI 2.29-4.00) inflammation, renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, but not delirium. Age, frailty (CFS 7 vs 1-3: OR 7.00, CI 5.27-9.32), delirium, dementia, and mental health diagnoses were all associated with increased risk of higher care needs on discharge. The likelihood of adverse outcomes increased across all grades of CFS from 4 to 9. Age and frailty are independently associated with adverse outcomes in COVID-19. Risk of increased care needs was also increased in survivors of COVID-19 with frailty or older age.","Alsahab, Beishon, Brown, Burn, Burton, Cox, Dani, Elhadi, Freshwater, Gaunt, Gordon, Goujon, Hale, Hughes, Jackson, Jelley, Khan, Khiroya, Lal, Madden, Magill, Masoli, Masud, McCluskey, McNeela, Mohammedseid-Nurhussien, Moorey, Lochlainn, Nirantharakumar, Okoth, Osuafor, Patterson, Pearson, Perry, Pettitt, Pigott, Pinkney, Quinn, Reynolds, Richardson, Sanyal, Seed, Sleeman, Soo, Steves, Strain, Taylor, Torsney, Welch, Wilson, Witham","https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afab026","20210205","covid-19; delirium; frailty; mortality; transitions of care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10382,""
"The Mental Well-Being of Frontline Physicians Working in Civil Wars Under Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic Conditions","<b>Background and Objective:</b> Emergency medical physicians are regarded as essential frontline staff in combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These health-care workers are faced with significant stressors in addition to the usual stress felt in their regular work. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and burnout among emergency physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Method:</b> Using a cross-sectional study methodology, we surveyed physicians active on April 2020 to study depression and anxiety [using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)] and burnout [using the Abbreviated Maslach Burnout Inventory (aMBI) scale]. <b>Results:</b> A total of 154 emergency physicians completed the survey. We found that about 65.6% of patients were experiencing anxiety (based on a HADS score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 11), and 73.4% were displaying depressive symptoms. For burnout, three subscales indicated that 67.5% endured emotional exhaustion, and 48.1% experienced depersonalization (defined as a score of Ã¢â€°Â¥10 on aMBI). A total of 21.4% of respondents perceived a sense of personal underachievement, defined as a score of &lt;10 via aMBI. <b>Conclusion:</b> Physicians' psychological status is crucial and plays a major role in their well-being, affecting their work satisfaction. Therefore, implementing strategies aimed at decreasing the impact of stressful events is crucial to alleviate the distress experienced by physicians on the frontline of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Elhadi, Msherghi, Elgzairi, Alhashimi, Bouhuwaish, Biala, Abuelmeda, Khel, Khaled, Alsoufi, Elhadi, BenGhatnsh","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.598720","20210206","COVID-19; anxiety; burnout; depression; pandemic; pandemic (COVID-19)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10383,""
"Prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder after infectious disease pandemics in the twenty-first century, including COVID-19: a meta-analysis and systematic review","Pandemics have become more frequent and more complex during the twenty-first century. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following pandemics is a significant public health concern. We sought to provide a reliable estimate of the worldwide prevalence of PTSD after large-scale pandemics as well as associated risk factors, by a systematic review and meta-analysis. We systematically searched the MedLine, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CNKI, WanFang, medRxiv, and bioRxiv databases to identify studies that were published from the inception up to August 23, 2020, and reported the prevalence of PTSD after pandemics including sudden acute respiratory syndromeÃ‚Â (SARS), H1N1, Poliomyelitis, Ebola, Zika, Nipah, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirusÃ‚Â (MERS-CoV), H5N1, and coronavirus disease 2019Ã‚Â (COVID-19). A total of 88 studies were included in the analysis, with 77 having prevalence information and 70 having risk factors information. The overall pooled prevalence of post-pandemic PTSD across all populations was 22.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-25.4%, I<sup>2</sup>: 99.7%). Healthcare workers had the highest prevalence of PTSD (26.9%; 95% CI: 20.3-33.6%), followed by infected cases (23.8%: 16.6-31.0%), and the general public (19.3%: 15.3-23.2%). However, the heterogeneity of study findings indicates that results should be interpreted cautiously. Risk factors including individual, family, and societal factors, pandemic-related factors, and specific factors in healthcare workers and patients for post-pandemic PTSD were summarized and discussed in this systematic review. Long-term monitoring and early interventions should be implemented to improve post-pandemic mental health and long-term recovery.","Yuan, Gong, Liu, Sun, Tian, Wang, Zhong, Zhang, Su, Liu, Zhang, Lin, Shi, Yan, Fazel, Vitiello, Bryant, Zhou, Ran, Bao, Shi, Lu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-021-01036-x","20210207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10384,""
"Pharmacogenomics and COVID-19: clinical implications of human genome interactions with repurposed drugs","The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has evolved into an emergent global pandemic. Many drugs without established efficacy are being used to treat COVID-19 patients either as an offlabel/compassionate use or as a clinical trial. Although drug repurposing is an attractive approach with reduced time and cost, there is a need to make predictions on success before the start of therapy. For the optimum use of these repurposed drugs, many factors should be considered such as drug-gene or dug-drug interactions, drug toxicity, and patient co-morbidity. There is limited data on the pharmacogenomics of these agents and this may constitute an obstacle for successful COVID-19 therapy. This article reviewed the available human genome interactions with some promising repurposed drugs for COVID-19 management. These drugs include chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r), atazanavir (ATV), favipiravir (FVP), nevirapine (NVP), efavirenz (EFV), oseltamivir, remdesivir, anakinra, tocilizumab (TCZ), eculizumab, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) regulators, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors, ivermectin, and nitazoxanide. Drug-gene variant pairs that may alter the therapeutic outcomes in COVID-19 patients are presented. The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in clinical efficacy include CQ/HCQ (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, ACE2, and HO-1); azithromycin (ABCB1); LPV/r (SLCO1B1, ABCB1, ABCC2 and CYP3A); NVP (ABCC10); oseltamivir (CES1 and ABCB1); remdesivir (CYP2C8, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and OATP1B1); anakinra (IL-1a); and TCZ (IL6R and FCGR3A). The major drug variant pairs that associated with variations in adverse effects include CQ/HCQ (G6PD; hemolysis and ABCA4; retinopathy), ATV (MDR1 and UGT1A1*28; hyperbilirubinemia; and APOA5; dyslipidemia), NVP (HLA-DRB1*01, HLA-B*3505 and CYP2B6; skin rash and MDR1; hepatotoxicity), and EFV (CYP2B6; depression and suicidal tendencies).","Badary","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41397-021-00209-9","20210207","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10385,""

"COVID-19 Lockdown and Self-Perceived Changes of Food Choice, Waste, Impulse Buying and Their Determinants in Italy: QuarantEat, a Cross-Sectional Study","Data about self-perceived food choice (FC) changes and their determinants during COVID-19 lockdowns are limited. This study investigated how the Italian lockdown affected self-perceived food purchases (FP), occurrence of impulse buying (IB), household food waste production (HFWP) and their determinants. A web-based cross-sectional survey was distributed in May 2020, collecting an opportunistic sample of the Italian population. A total of 1865 (70% females) people were enrolled, the median age was 29 (IQR 16.0). Most of the sample increased overall FP (53.4%), food consumption (43.4%), reduced HFWP (53.7%) and halved the prevalence of IB (20.9%) compared to the period before the lockdown (42.5%). Baking ingredients, fresh vegetables, fresh fruit and chocolate had the largest sales increase by individuals, while bakery products, fresh fish and salted snacks purchases highly decreased. Increased FP was associated with the occurrence of IB (adjOR 2.48, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and inversely associated with not having worked during lockdown (adjOR 0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.003). Multivariable logistic regressions revealed occurrence of IB was associated with low perceived dietary quality (adjOR 2.22, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), resulting at risk, according to the Emotional Overeating Questionnaire (EOQ, adjOR 1.68, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and inversely associated with decreased HFWP (adjOR 0.73, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.012). Reduced HFWP was associated with higher perceived dietary quality (adjOR 2.27, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and negatively associated with low score at WHO-5 Well-Being Index (adjOR 0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.002). The Italian lockdown highly affected FC behaviours, leading to positive and sustainable habits towards food purchase and consumption. Public health interventions are needed to keep these new positive effects and avoid negative consequences in case of future lockdowns.","Scacchi, Catozzi, Boietti, Bert, Siliquini","https://doi.org/10.3390/foods10020306","20210205","COVID-19; coronavirus; emotional eating; food choice; food consumption; food purchase; food waste; impulse buying; lockdown; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10390,""

These include: the challenge in helping students to reacclimatise to academic work following a period of prolonged educational disruption, supporting students to access the â€˜hidden curriculumâ€™ of Higher Education, negotiating mental health consequences of COVID-19, and remaining sensitive to inequalities of educational provision that students have experienced as a result of COVID-19.

"Information Dissemination and the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Relationship between Different Information Sources and Symptoms of Psychopathology","The 2020-2021 COVID-19 pandemic has added to the mental health strain on individuals and groups across the world. Viral mitigation protocols and viral spread affect millions every day, but to widely different degrees. How individuals gather information about the pandemic might have an effect on levels of mental distress in the population. In this cross-sectional and representative study of the adult population of Norway, findings suggest that information gathered through newspapers and social media are the information pathways with the strongest association to symptoms of anxiety, depression and health anxiety with small to medium effect sizes. However, avoiding information about the pandemic had larger effect sizes related to symptoms of psychopathology than acquiring information about the pandemic from any source. The results suggest that to reach those who avoid pandemic news is an important goal, both to ensure the population as a whole gets relevant information regarding current viral mitigation protocols, that may in turn alleviate stress, and thus reduce the likelihood of viral transmission. The spread of pandemic misinformation on social media and the internet must be buffered, and successful interventions against misinformation may affect the mental health of the population.","Ole Myklebust Amundsen et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46047-375-DB9","20210207","PsyArXiv|Life Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Community; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Impression Formation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Self-regulation; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social and Personality Psychology|Social Influence; psychopathology; information sources; avoidance; covid-19","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-08","",10396,""
