"Service failures in times of crisis: An analysis of eWOM emotionality","The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt consumer experiences as well as service operations. Despite the magnitude of this exogenous shock, little is known about the pandemicâ€™s impact on consumers. Building on engagement theory, this study examines consumersâ€™ emotional responses to service failures on social media. Contributing to the brand equity literature, we test whether electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) emotionality is contingent on brand strength. To do so, we analyzed 327,205 tweets directed at airline brands over the first 12 months of the pandemic in addition to data from a nonaffected period. The models show that consumersâ€™ overall emotionality in tweets was lower during the pandemic than before it. Over the course of the pandemic, levels of joy were lower while levels of sadness and anger were more prominent in tweets directed at weaker brands. Thus, brand strength still acts as a â€œbufferâ€ if service failures are caused by exogenous shocks.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.113349","20230101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-17","",39372,""
"The Role of Emotion Regulatory Processes in Mental Health Across the Lifespan During a Year of the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic there has been a rise in common mental health problems compared to pre-pandemic levels, especially in young people. Understanding the factors that place young people at risk is critical to guide the response to increased mental health problems. Here we examine whether age-related differences in emotion regulatory processes account for the higher levels of mental health problems reported by young people during the pandemic. Method: Participants (N=2367; 89.95% female, 11-100 years) from Australia, UK, and USA were surveyed thrice at three-month intervals during the first year of the pandemic (May 2020â€“April 2021). Participants completed measures of emotion regulatory processes (adaptive and maladaptive strategy use and mental flexibility), negative and positive affect, and mental health problems. Results: Younger age was associated with lower positive (p<0.001) and greater negative (p<0.001) affect across the first year of the pandemic. Maladaptive emotion regulation partially accounted for age-related variance in affect (positive affect: p=0.004; negative affect: p<0.001); whereby younger age was associated with greater maladaptive emotion regulation which, in turn, was associated with poorer affect. Maladaptive emotion regulation and its effect on changes in affect, in turn, partially accounted for age-related variance in mental health problems (positive affect: p=0.003; negative affect: p=0.013). Conclusion: Our findings add to the growing literature demonstrating adolescent vulnerability during the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggest that maladaptive emotion regulation may be a promising target for intervention. Targeting such processes, especially in young people, may lead to improvements in affect, and in turn, mental health.","Savannah Minihan et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0163-219-49B","20221017","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Developmental Psychology|Adolescence; covid-19; emotion regulation; mental flexibility; mental health; affect","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-10-17","",39373,""
