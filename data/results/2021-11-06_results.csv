"COVID-19 pandemic impact on the therapeutic setting in Mental Health Services","The new 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak forced mental health providers to overcome their general reluctance about telematic assistance, shifting from a face-to-face approach to online therapy to promote continuity of care for psychiatric patients. An ad-hoc web-based survey questionnaire assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on therapeutic setting in Mental Health Services was sent via email from March 15, 2021 to June 15, 2021 to mental health providers in Genova, Italy. The survey was anonymous and a free Google FormsÃ‚Â®Ã‚Â software was used. Two hundred nineteen mental health providers completed the survey, and the overall response rate (ORR) was 65%. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, the continuity of care was mainly guaranteed using electronic devices. Psychologists reported a higher availability of video call assistance service to guarantee continuity of care for psychiatric patients compared to psychiatrists and psychotherapists (p&lt;0,001). Psychiatrists reported the lowest degree of satisfaction about this new telematic approach (p&lt;0,01), while psychologists and to a lesser extent psychotherapists speculated to use it even in non-pandemic times (p=0,02). COVID-19 pandemic creates an opportunity to overcome normative, technological and cultural barriers to the use of online psychotherapy, showing the importance of adapting the therapeutic setting to both collective and individual needs. Despite initial concerns about its effectiveness and efficacy, a general degree of satisfaction was expressed by the majority of the mental health providers. Further efforts will be needed to enhance this new way of working and to train therapists with particular regard to those employed in the public health system.","Trabucco, Aguglia, Amerio, Corsini, Cervetti, Escelsior, Costanza, Serafini, Amore","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92iS6.12227","20211105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21291,""
"Telephone counselling in coping with the COVID-19 lockdown consequences: preliminary data","The direct and indirect stressful effects of COVID-19 lockdown measures adopted to restrict population movements to help curb the epidemic impacted on people's daily lives. Biella is a small Northern Italy province, historically characterized by the presence of an important and once flourishing textile industry. For decades this province has had suicide rates higher than the Piedmonts and Italian average. In two most recent decades a positive correlation between financial stressors, 2008 economic crisis related, and suicide has been found. As the current economic crisis COVID-19 related is expected to exacerbate again the vulnerability to suicide of this province, during the first lockdown the Crisis Center for Suicide Prevention of Biella set up a telephone counselling service. We aimed to evaluate whether it represented a suitable and useful tool for suicidal crisis prevention. Each phone intervention consisted of four phases: (i) psychoeducation, (ii) emotional stabilization, (iii) personal resources identification/reinforcement, (iv) session ending. This service provided a rapid therapeutic response to urgent requests for care, psychological support, and reassurance. It was able to mitigate stress and reinforce resilience in particularly vulnerable populations. The most innovative element of this project was that it proposed interventions for the emotional stabilization, something that is usually used in face-to-face sessions. Using the right protocols, it proved to offer continuity care and reduce pressure on hospital emergency departments while delivering good outcomes and patient satisfaction. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to overcome normative, technological, and cultural barriers regarding the use of remote healthcare services.","Macchiarulo, Branca, Mallardi, Costanza, Amerio, Aguglia, Serafini, Amore, Merli","https://doi.org/10.23750/abm.v92iS6.12236","20211105","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21292,""
"Design, content, and fieldwork procedures of the COVID-19Ã‚Â Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study - Wave 4","This paper outlines fieldwork procedures for Wave 4 of the COVID-19 Psychological Research Consortium (C19PRC) Study in the UK during November-December 2020. Respondents provided data on socio-political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours, and mental health disorders (anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress). In Phase 1, adults (NÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2878) were reinvited to participate. At Phase 2, new recruitment: (i) replenished the longitudinal strand to account for attrition; and (ii) oversampled from the devolved UK nations to facilitate robust between-country analyses for core study outcomes. Weights were calculated using a survey raking algorithm to ensure the longitudinal panel was representative of the baseline sample characteristics. In Phase 1, 1796 adults were successfully recontacted and provided full interviews at Wave 4 (62.4% retention rate). In Phase 2, 292 new respondents were recruited to replenish the panel, as well as 1779 adults from Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, who were representative of the socio-political composition of the adult populations in these nations. The raking procedure successfully re-balanced the longitudinal panel to within 1% of population estimates for selected socio-demographic characteristics. The C19PRC Study offers a unique opportunity to facilitate and stimulate interdisciplinary research addressing important public health questions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.","McBride, Butter, Murphy, Shevlin, Hartman, Bennett, Stocks, Lloyd, McKay, Gibson-Miller, Levita, Mason, Martinez, Hyland, ValliÃƒÂ¨res, Karatzias, Valiente, Vazquez, Bentall","https://doi.org/10.1002/mpr.1899","20211105","COVID-19; general population; longitudinal; psychological; survey methodology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21293,""
"Anxiety among the parents of pediatric patients receiving IVIG therapy during the Covid-19 pandemic","Symptomatic COVID-19 cases in children occur mostly in those with primary immunodeficiency (PID), chronic lung diseases, and heart disease. Guidelines recommend that patients with PID continue to use their regular medication during the pandemic. This study aimed to evaluate anxiety related to COVID-19 in the parents of patients receiving intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment in our hospital and to evaluate the effect of their anxiety on the continuity of treatment. The parents of the patients who underwent IVIG therapy in our clinic during the pandemic (between May 15, 2020 and July 1, 2020) were included in our study. Twenty-seven patients with PID whose IVIG therapy was initiated before the pandemic and 29 non- PID control subjects were included in the study. All patients received IVIG treatment in our clinic continued treatment during the pandemic at the same dose intervals. Parents in the IVIG group had significantly higher state (p=0.003) and trait (p=0.003) anxiety scores compared to control parents. IVIG group showed statistically significant higher scores in Beck depression inventory, than the control group (p=0.002). The parents of PID patients who needed to come to the hospital for IVIG therapy had higher anxiety levels than the parents of similar aged children who presented to our clinic for different complaints between the same dates. Despite their concerns, the parents of all patients under IVIG therapy maintained treatment continuity at the recommended treatment intervals. None of our immunodeficient patients who presented for treatment during the pandemic contracted COVID-19 infection during our study.","Topal, Metin, Ãƒâ€¡ÃƒÂ¶p, DinÃƒÂ§, ÃƒÅ“neri","https://doi.org/10.24953/turkjped.2021.05.008","20211105","COVID-19; anxiety; intravenous immunoglobulin treatment; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21294,""
"Network Analysis of Insomnia in Chinese Mental Health Professionals During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Study","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is associated with increased risk of insomnia symptoms (insomnia hereafter) in health-care professionals. Network analysis is a novel approach in linking mechanisms at the symptom level. The aim of this study was to characterize the insomnia network structure in mental health professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 10,516 mental health professionals were recruited from psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric units of general hospitals nationwide between March 15 and March 20, 2020. Insomnia was assessed with the insomnia severity index (ISI). Centrality index (ie, strength) was used to identify symptoms central to the network. The stability of network was examined using a case-dropping bootstrap procedure. The network structures between different genders were also compared. The overall network model showed that the item ISI7 (interference with daytime functioning) was the most central symptom in mental health professionals with the highest strength. The network was robust in stability and accuracy tests. The item ISI4 (sleep dissatisfaction) was connected to the two main clusters of insomnia symptoms (ie, the cluster of nocturnal and daytime symptoms). No significant gender network difference was found. Interference with daytime functioning was the most central symptom, suggesting that it may be an important treatment outcome measure for insomnia. Appropriate treatments, such as stimulus control techniques, cognitive behavioral therapy and relaxation training, could be developed. Moreover, addressing sleep satisfaction in treatment could simultaneously ameliorate daytime and nocturnal symptoms.","Bai, Zhao, An, Zhang, Sha, Cheung, Cheng, Ng, Xiang","https://doi.org/10.2147/NSS.S326880","20211105","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; insomnia; physicians; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21295,""
"Follow-Up Study of the Cardiopulmonary and Psychological Outcomes of COVID-19 Survivors Six Months After Discharge in Sichuan, China","Some studies have shown that patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) still have sequelae after discharge. However, little is known about the long-term physical and psychological sequelae of patients, especially factors that influenced the prognosis. Patients with COVID-19 were followed up for 6 months. The psychological status of patients was evaluated by DASS-21 questionnaire, while physical functions were determined using medical history, laboratory examination, thoracic computed tomography (CT), and echocardiography. Fifty patients infected with COVID-19 were enrolled, and 11 (22%) patients still showed symptoms related to COVID-19. The mean contents (cells/ul) of CD3+ cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T, B lymphocytes and NK cells of the survivors elevated significantly after 6-month discharge (P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of ground-glass opacities and consolidations decreased from 90% to 42% (P &lt; 0.001), and 54% to 20%, (P = 0.001), respectively, while the changes of reticulation and bronchiectasis were insignificant (P &gt; 0.05). The frequency of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction decreased from 40% to 15% (P = 0.002). Depression was observed in 5 (12.5%) participants, stress in 3 (7.5%), anxiety in 6 (15%), and among them 1 (2.5%) showed extremely severe anxiety. Covariation analysis elucidated age might be a risk factor (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.01-1.18, P = 0.038), while NK cell was a good prognostic factor for pulmonary recovery. The comorbidities were significantly positive correlated with persist pulmonary damage (r = 0.33, P = 0.020). Compared with patients with antiviral therapy, patients without antiviral therapy had higher anxiety score (3 vs 0, P = 0.033). After 6-month discharge, the persisting cardiopulmonary damage was observed in recovery patients, and psychological implications should not be ignored. Age, comorbidities, NK cell and antiviral therapy might be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19.","Dai, Zhao, Liu, Zhou, Liu, Lan, Li, Luo, Zeng, Li","https://doi.org/10.2147/IJGM.S337604","20211105","COVID-19; cardiopulmonary; follow-up; influence factors; psychology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21296,""
"Healthcare Workers' Burdens During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Systematic Review","The global healthcare system is continuing to confront major challenges during the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the second wave the deadliest one to date. This study aimed to identify and explore the challenges and burdens of frontline healthcare workers during the current pandemic, and to help prepare workforce support plans for them now and in the future. A qualitative systematic review method involving thematic synthesis without meta-analysis was used to analyze relevant studies from five databases from November 2020 to February 2021: MEDLINE via PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Embase through Ovid, Scopus, and Web of Science. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Qualitative Research Checklist appraisal tools. This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA statement. The informants are healthcare workers working at the frontlines and providing care to COVID-19 patients. Ten studies revealed the burden of healthcare providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, with having the related challenges experienced by 498 participants (doctors, nurses, pediatric nurses, paramedical staff, support staff, and physiotherapists). Our findings fell into four main themes as follows: inadequate preparedness; emotional challenges; insufficient equipment and information; and work burnout. The study results demonstrate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all aspects of life, especially for healthcare providers, who work on the frontlines. The pandemic has affected the frontline workers' physical and psychological health, causing them to experience emotional distress such as fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. In addition, the pandemic can increase posttraumatic stress disorder, leading to burnout and discontinuity of healthcare workloads to ensure the patients' safety and the high quality of care provided to the patients.","Koontalay, Suksatan, Prabsangob, Sadang","https://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S330041","20211105","COVID-19; healthcare personnel; qualitative review; qualitative studies; qualitative systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21297,""
"COVID-19 Impact on Intern Exposure to Common Inpatient Diagnoses","We sought to understand the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the clinical exposure of pediatric interns to common pediatric inpatient diagnoses. We analyzed electronic medical record data to compare intern clinical exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic from June 2020 through February 2021 with the same academic blocks from 2017 to 2020. We attributed patients to each pediatric intern on the basis of notes written during their pediatric hospital medicine rotation to compare intern exposures with common inpatient diagnoses before and during the pandemic. We compared the median number of notes written per intern per block overall, as well as for each common inpatient diagnosis. Median counts of notes written per intern per block were significantly reduced in the COVID-19 group compared with the pre-COVID-19 group (96 [interquartile range (IQR): 81-119)] vs 129 [IQR: 110-160]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Median intern notes per block was lower in the COVID-19 group for all months except February 2021. Although the median number of notes for many common inpatient diagnoses was significantly reduced, they were higher for mental health (4 [IQR: 2-9] vs 2 [IQR: 1-6]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001) and suicidality (4.5 [IQR: 2-8] vs 0 [IQR: 0-2]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001). Median shifts worked per intern per block was also reduced in the COVID-19 group (22 [IQR: 21-23] vs 23 [IQR: 22-24]; <i>P</i> &lt; .001).

"RE-COVER project: AÃ‚Â survey on resilience, mental health, and fear of Covid-19 in four countries","The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health of people worldwide. Psychological resilience has been shown to buffer against the threat of the pandemic (i.e., COVID-19 fear) and sustain mental health. The extent to which psychological resilience factors impact mental health maintenance, however, is unclear, given broad differences in infection rates, prevention approaches, government interventions across different cultures and contexts. Our study examines resilience factors and how they protect individuals from COVID-19-related fear and sustain their mental health. Data were collected from 1583 (M<sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°32.22, SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.90, RangeÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°19-82) respondents from Japan, China, the United States, and Malaysia between October to November 2020. We collected data across age and sex, marital status, number of children, and occupations. We also accounted for stay-at-home measures, change in income, COVID-19 infection status, place of residence, and subjective social status in the study. Our variables included mental health-related and resilience constructs, namely (i) fear of COVID-19, (ii) depression, anxiety, and stress; (iii) present, past, and future life satisfaction, (iv) sense of control, (v) positive emotions, (vi) ego-resilience, (vii) grit, (viii) self-compassion, (ix) passion, and (x) relational mobility. All questionnaires were assessed for their suitability across the four countries with the necessary translation checks.

"Gender differences in psychosocial status of adolescents during COVID-19: a six-country cross-sectional survey in Asia Pacific","School closures and family economic instability caused by the COVID-19 lockdown measures have threatened the mental health and academic progress of adolescents. Through secondary data analysis of World Vision Asia Pacific Region's COVID-19 response-assessments in May-June 2020, this study examined whether adolescents' study, physical, and leisure activities, psychosocial status, and sources of COVID-19 information differed by gender. The assessments used cross-sectional surveys of adolescents in poor communities served by World Vision (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5552 males and nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6680 females) aged 10-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old in six countries. The study households of adolescents were selected either by random sampling or non-probability convenience sampling and assessed using telephone or in-person interviews. Multivariate logistic regression analyses examined the relationship between gender and psychosocial status; daily activities (e.g., play, study); and sources of information about COVID-19. Participation in remote education was low (range: 0.5-20.7% across countries), with gender difference found only in Vietnam. Compared to males, female adolescents were less likely to play physically with a range of AOR: 0.36-0.55 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°5 countries) or play video games with a range of AOR: 0.55-0.72 (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2 countries). Female adolescents were more likely to feel isolated or stressed (India, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.13, 95%CI:1.00,Ã‚Â 1.26); feel unsafe (the Philippines, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.22, 95%CI:1.14,Ã‚Â 4.33; Vietnam, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31, 95%CI:1.03,Ã‚Â 1.47); be concerned about education (India, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.24, 95%CI:1.09,Ã‚Â 1.41; Myanmar, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.59, 95%CI:1.05,Ã‚Â 2.40); or be concerned about household income (India, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.13, 95%CI:1.00,Ã‚Â 1.28; Vietnam, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.31, 95%CI:1.09,Ã‚Â 1.58). Female adolescents were also less likely to obtain COVID-19 related information through internet/social media (Bangladesh, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.51, 95%CI:0.41, 0.64; India, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.84, 95%CI:0.73, 0.96; and Myanmar, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.65, 95%CI:0.43, 0.97) and mobile call or short message (India, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.88, 95%CI:0.80, 0.98) but more likely to get the information from friends (Vietnam, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.18, 95%CI:1.02, 1.36) and family (Bangladesh, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.44, 95% CI:1.21, 1.70; India, AORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.29, 95% CI:1.15, 1.45). An understanding of gender differences in the impacts of COVID-19 on adolescents' schooling, physical, and mental health can inform adolescent protection interventions.

"Benzalkonium chlorides (C12) inhibits growth but motivates microcystins release of Microcystis aeruginosa revealed by morphological, physiological, and iTRAQ investigation","Due to the large-scale outbreak of Corona Virus Disease (2019), amounts of disinfecting agents was regularly used in public environments and their potential toxicity towards organisms needed to be appreciated. Thus, one mostly used cationic disinfectant, benzalkonium chlorides (BAC(C12)), was selected to assess its potential toxicity one common cyanobacteria Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) in this study. The aims were to explore the toxic effect and mechanism of BAC (C12) on M. aeruginosa growth within 96Â h via morphological, physiological, and the relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomics variations. The results found that BAC(C12) significantly inhibited cell density of M. aeruginosa at concentrations from 1Â mg/L to 10Â mg/L, and the 96-h EC 50 value was identified to be 3.61Â mg/L. Under EC 50 concentration, BAC(C12) depressed the photosynthesis activities of M. aeruginosa exhibited by 36% decline of the maximum quantum yield for primary photochemistry (Fv/Fm) value and denaturation of photosynthetic organelle, caused oxidative stress response displayed by the increase of three indexes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), and destroyed the integrity of cell membranes demonstrated by TEM images and the increase of ex-cellular substances. Then, the iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis demonstrated that BAC(C12) depressed photosynthesis activities through inhibiting the expressions of photosynthetic protein and photosynthetic electron transport related proteins. The suppression of electron transport also led to the increase of superoxide radicals and then posed oxidative stress on cell. Meantime, the 63.63% ascent of extracellular microcystin production of M. aeruginosa was observed, attributing to the high expression of microcystin synthesis proteins and the damage of cell membrane. In sum, BAC(C12) exposure inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa mainly by depressing photosynthesis, inducing oxidative stress, and breaking the cell membrane. And, it enhanced the release of microcystin from the cyanobacterial cells via up-regulating the microcystin synthesis proteins and inducing the membrane damage, which could enlarge its toxicity to aquatic species.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2021.118305","20220101","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21303,""

"Big data and predictive modelling for the opioid crisis: existing research and future potential","A need exists to accurately estimate overdose risk and improve understanding of how to deliver treatments and interventions in people with opioid use disorder in a way that reduces such risk. We consider opportunities for predictive analytics and routinely collected administrative data to evaluate how overdose could be reduced among people with opioid use disorder. Specifically, we summarise global trends in opioid use and overdoses; describe the use of big data in research into opioid overdose; consider the potential for predictive modelling, including machine learning, for prevention and monitoring of opioid overdoses; and outline the challenges and risks relating to the use of big data and machine learning in reducing harms that are related to opioid use. Future research for improving the coverage and provision of existing interventions, treatments, and resources for opioid use disorder requires collaboration of multiple agencies. Predictive modelling could transport the concept of stratified medicine to public health through novel methods, such as predictive modelling and emulated trials for evaluating diagnoses and prognoses of opioid use disorder, predicting treatment response, and providing targeted treatment recommendations.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/S2589-7500(21)00058-3","20210601","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-11-06","",21306,""
