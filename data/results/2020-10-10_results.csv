"Validation of the COVID-19 fears questionnaires for chronic medical conditions: A scleroderma patient-centered intervention network COVID-19 cohort study","Objective Fear associated with medical vulnerability should be considered when assessing mental health among individuals with chronic medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic  The objective was to develop and validate the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions  Methods Fifteen initial items were generated based on suggestions from 121 people with the chronic autoimmune disease systemic sclerosis (SSc;scleroderma)  Patients in a COVID-19 SSc cohort completed items between April 9 and 27, 2020  Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and item analysis were used to select items for inclusion  Cronbach's alpha and Pearson correlations were used to evaluate internal consistency reliability and convergent validity  Factor structure was confirmed with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in follow-up data collection two weeks later  Results 787 participants completed baseline measures;563 of them completed the follow-up assessment  Ten of 15 initial items were included in the final questionnaire  EFA suggested that a single dimension explained the data reasonably well  There were no indications of floor or ceiling effects  Cronbach's alpha was 0 91  Correlations between the COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire and measures of anxiety (rÂ =Â 0 53), depressive symptoms (rÂ =Â 0 44), and perceived stress (rÂ =Â 0 50) supported construct validity  CFA supported the single-factor structure (<U+03C7>2(35)Â =Â 311 2, pÂ &lt;Â 0 001, Tucker-Lewis IndexÂ =Â 0 97, Comparative Fit IndexÂ =Â 0 96, Root Mean Square Error of ApproximationÂ =Â 0 12)  Conclusion The COVID-19 Fears Questionnaire for Chronic Medical Conditions can be used to assess fear among people at risk due to pre-existing medical conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic","Wu, Yin; Kwakkenbos, Linda; Henry, Richard S.; Tao, Lydia; Harb, Sami; Bourgeault, Angelica; Carrier, Marie-Eve; Levis, Brooke; Sun, Ying; Bhandari, Parash Mani; Carboni-JimÃ©nez, Andrea; Gagarine, Maria; He, Chen; Krishnan, Ankur; Negeri, Zelalem F.; Neupane, Dipika; Mouthon, Luc; Bartlett, Susan J.; Benedetti, Andrea; Thombs, Brett D.; Culos-Reed, Nicole; El-Baalbaki, Ghassan; Hebblethwaite, Shannon; Patten, Scott; Varga, John; Bustamante, Laura; Duchek, Delaney; Ellis, Kelsey; Rice, Danielle; Dyas, Laura; FortunÃ©, Catherine, Gietzen; Amy, Guillot; GeneviÃ¨ve, Lewis; Nancy, Nielsen; Karen, Richard; Michelle, SauvÃ©, Maureen, Welling; Joep","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychores.2020.110271","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research;2020.; Publication details: Journal of Psychosomatic Research;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5646,""
"Sleep quality during the COVID-19 pandemic: Not one size fits all","Background The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a long period of stress on people worldwide and has been shown to significantly affect sleep duration across different populations  However, decreases in sleep quality rather than duration are associated with adverse mental health effects  Additionally, the one third of the general population suffering from poor sleep quality was underrepresented in previous studies  The current study aimed to elucidate effects of the COVID -19 pandemic on sleep quality across different levels of pre-pandemic sleep complaints and as a function of affect and worry  Method Participants of the Netherlands Sleep Registry (NSR) were invited for weekly online assessment of the subjective severity of major stressors, insomnia, sleep times, distress, depression, and anxiety using validated scales  Analysis To investigate the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the sleep quality of people with and without a history of insomnia, we performed a mixed model analysis using pre-pandemic insomnia severity, negative affect, and worry as predictors  Results The effect of COVID -19 on sleep quality differs critically across participants, and depends on the pre-pandemic sleep quality  Interestingly, a quarter of people with pre-pandemic (clinical) insomnia experienced a meaningful improvement in sleep quality, whereas 20% of pre-pandemic good sleepers experienced worse sleep during the lockdown measures  Additionally, changes in sleep quality throughout the pandemic were associated with negative affect and worry  Conclusion Our data suggests that there is no uniform effect of the lockdown on sleep quality  COVID-19 lockdown measures more often worsened sleep complaints in pre-pandemic good sleepers, whereas a subset of people with pre-pandemic severe insomnia symptoms underwent a clinically meaningful alleviation of symptoms in our sample","Kocevska, Desana; Blanken, Tessa F.; Van Someren, Eus J.

"Shattering the paradox of guns and crime: Incidence, prevalence, and the 2020 Stockholm Prize","Abstract The apparent paradox of guns and crime is that gun homicide rates have been dropping for three decades in the United States while the number of guns in circulation has been rising  Those trends form an apparent paradox because guns are so much more lethal, given an attack, than other weapons, and in general, the more weapons in a state, the higher the rate of death from firearms  As both winners of the 2020 Stockholm Prize have shown, an additional element of evidence is needed to understand why there is no true paradox  With the declining percentage of households owning guns (at least until COVID-19), the prevalence of gun ownership has been declining, even while the incidence (mean number of guns owned per owner) has been rising  The key to reducing gun violence, and perhaps suicides as well, may thus be reduced prevalence, even with rising incidence","Sherman, Lawrence W.","https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12522","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Criminology & Public Policy;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication details: Criminology & Public Policy;n/a(n/a), 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5648,""

"Data Handling for E-Mental Health Professionals","Digital psychiatry and e-mental health have proliferated and permeated vastly in the current landscape of mental health care provision  The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated this digital transformation, and changes that usually take many years to translate into clinical practice have been implemented in a matter of weeks  These have outpaced the checks and balances that would typically accompany such changes, which has brought into focus a need to have a proper approach for digital data handling  Health care data is sensitive, and is prone to hacking due to the lack of stringent protocols regarding its storage and access  Mental health care data need to be more secure due to the stigma associated with having a mental health condition  Thus, there is a need to emphasize proper data handling by mental health professionals, and policies to ensure safeguarding patient?s privacy are required  The aim of useful, free, and fair use of mental health care data for clinical, business, and research purposes should be balanced with the need to ensure the data is accessible to only those who are authorized  Systems and policies should be in place to ensure that data storage, access, and disposal are systematic and conform to data safety norms","Grover, Sandeep; Sarkar, Siddharth; Gupta, Rahul","https://doi.org/10.1177/0253717620956732","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine;2020.; Publication details: Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5663,""

"The Global Pandemic, Policy Space and Fiscal Rules to Achieve Stronger Stabilization Policies","The world economy was slowing prior to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic  The slowdown began after a record-long period of expansion marked with record lows in unemployment and strong economic indicators along most dimensions  Even at a high point of the business cycle, however, ""depression style"" economic policies of very low or zero policy interest rates and large budget deficits were being followed in many countries-partly due to the lingering effects of the Great Recession and partly due the longstanding problem of ""deficit bias"" in fiscal policy  Fiscal responses to the Covid-19 shock in the form of wage support, business loans and other programs in 2020 were substantial and necessary but, following already large fiscal deficits and growing government debt, have aggravated the problem of long-term fiscal solvency  In some cases, concerns over record peacetime budget deficits constrained government's willingness to pursue further rounds of fiscal stimulus as the Covid-19 crisis deepened  This article argues that deficit bias constrained discretionary fiscal policy actions arises from political economy factors and demonstrates that fiscal rules are an important instrument to mitigate deficit bias and restore countries to longer-term solvency  Countries with strong fiscal rules had much better fiscal and debt positions prior to the Great Financial Crisis, allowing them in turn to pursue much more stimulative fiscal policies in response to the crisis  The same situation faced policy makers at the onset of the pandemic economic crisis-- those with strong fiscal rules were in a much better position to provide large fiscal responses to support the economy without endangering national debt solvency  Facilitating long-term fiscal solvency and allowing for larger discretionary fiscal actions in crisis situations provides a strong argument for the strengthening and enforcement of fiscal rules around the world","Hutchison, Michael M.","https://doi.org/10.22904/sje.2020.33.3.003","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Seoul Journal of Economics;33(3):307-331, 2020.; Publication details: Seoul Journal of Economics;33(3):307-331, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5665,""

respiratory clinic quality control,and how to do a better job for respiratory clinics during the secondary COVID-19 epidemic time By managing suspected patients through quality control,especially by isolating potential sources of infection,cutting off all transmission routes,and ultimately eliminating crossinfection between physicians and patients,we aimed to eliminate transmission and protect physicians and patients and their families in this special time  The key point of clinical quality control is strict training, including familiarity with diagnostic and treatment guidelines,self-control(including special work clothes and medical masks before serving the patients),and eliminating social events and not touching any risks  Doing better job for respiratory clinics requires disinfection and ventilation,respiratory physicians should also be prepared to do the necessary before- and after-care disinfection and protection  The consultation process requires strict implementation of the guidelines  It is recommended that hospitals equipped with necessary instruments serve patients in their home with Internet of Things or Internet,to minimize the possibility of transmission  It is also recommended to minimize unnecessary examinations as much as possible,points of paying attention to the patientâ€™s examination and admission precautions are also listed, with special circumstances response strategies In addition,special emphasis is needed to consider COVID- 19 as an infectious disease  Physicians should not miss the patients or virus-carriers,and should avoid overlooking of the super-spreaders,so as not to cause social harm  When diagnosis and differential diagnosis are difficult,attentions should be paid to opinions from the chest physicians  For patients who cannot rule out a potential history of exposure,i e ,with related symptoms,imaging shows lung infection, white blood cells are not high,even if the nucleic acid test is negative,they

"COVID-19 anxiety: Malaysian regulatory mechanisms on mental health","Quarantine due to the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) may cause a broad range of neurological symptoms, including but not limited to signs of post-traumatic stress, fatigue, anxiety, rage, panic, and even addiction to drugs  In addition, the results have showed some of these negative effects, most specifically post-traumatic stress syndrome, could have an effect on long-term people and could be more important among those with a history of mental disorder and related healthcare providers  Due to this latest COVID-19 pandemic, several nations, including Malaysia, have urged citizens to quarantine at home or at the quarantine centre  Those are among the causes that influence the degree of psychological effect on those engaged in quarantine, such as the amount of time spent in quarantine, feelings of fatigue, anger and anxiety, lack of resources such as food, water and clothes, loss of family members and love;and loss of productive knowledge  Losing income and profits owing to cessation of job or unemployed, and the stigma and guilt about getting sick or getting others sick are always viewed as something shameful and linked to mental wellbeing problems  Therefore, this research endeavours to develop a coherent regulatory mechanism which can be used to analyse the ways in order to minimise negative mental health status in the present pandemic, quarantine should last no longer than necessary;health authorities should give clear guidance and ample services to those who are impacted by quarantine  Often, healthcare staff are required to receive medical help from their supervisors, and those with pre-existing mental illness will require additional assistance through this quarantine time  In China, China's National Health Commission has called an immediate request for psychiatric distress action and has established numerous legislation and psychosocial mental wellbeing and frameworks  This condition varies from nation to nation  In Malaysia, it is arguable thatThe absence and lack of mental health and psychosocial regulatory structures, scarcity of well-trained mental health practitioners, and lack of active expert interventions (NGOs, health institutions, state municipal participation, academic sectors) could importantly affect the communities  Hence, there is an urgent need to create a robust and effective guidance that magnifies the risks of long-term psychological distress impact  Having said that, public mental health monitoring should therefore be considered as part of epidemic monitoring which may help detect potential problems  These later contribute to a forum in a way to formulate an effective solution to public mental wellbeing, and help address concerns or dilemmas that happened among pre-existing psychological illness families, during or after the outbreak of COVID-19  Ignorance of the pandemic's effect on mental wellbeing problems would not only hamper efforts to deter further dissemination of COVID-19, it would also inflate current health gaps  Â© 2020 SERSC","Zulkipli, Z.

"Stigma on first responders during COVID-19","During the pandemic, first responders were at an increased risk of being stigmatized because of their direct exposure to COVID-19;stigmatization is an undesirable stereotype that can contribute to a myriad of adverse effects, including, but not limited to, anxiety, depression, devaluing, rejection, stress, health problems, exposure to risks, and limiting protective factors  The objectives of this research were to understand stigma on first responders during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the consequences of stigma on first responder's mental health  A qualitative phenomenological study used semistructured interviews to understand the experiences of first responders during the pandemic  This study included a convenience sampling of 31 first responders (e g , physicians, nurses, paramedics, police officers, firefighters, etc ) located worldwide  First responders reported feelings of isolation, lack of support and understanding by family or friends, decreased or forced removal in immediate social interaction (e g , within family and friend circles), sentiments of being infected or dirty, increased feelings of sadness and anxiety, and reluctance to ask for help or get treatment (e g , self-approval of being isolated)  By answering these research questions, this information highlighted additional challenges that may be faced by first responders aside from being a frontline worker during a pandemic, which is equally stressful  By understanding the role of stigma, public health practitioners during pandemics or emergency situations can seek to diminish it  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Zolnikov, Tara Rava; Furio, Frances","https://doi.org/10.1037/sah0000270","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Stigma and Health;2020.; Publication details: Stigma and Health;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5674,""

"Pediatric consultation-liaison psychology services during the COVID-19 pandemic: Pivoting to provide care","Objective: The novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a rapid shift in the health care landscape  To meet the psychological needs of children/adolescents in the medical setting, pediatric consultation-liaison (CL) psychologists have had to radically adapt their traditional forms of practice  Method: To understand this adaptation, a questionnaire was sent to members of the consultation-liaison and related special interest groups of the Society of Pediatric Psychology (American Psychological Association Division 54)  Questions included: participant background;practice setting;prepandemic/peri-pandemic psychological service delivery methodology;speed/level of support for service transition;and open-ended questions on challenges and benefits of providing CL services during the pandemic  Responses to open-ended questions were coded using content analysis  Results: Between April 6 and April 20, 2020, 51 individuals (88 2% female;86 3% psychologists;72 5% in free-standing children's hospitals) participated  Findings showed service methodology shifted from predominantly face-to-face prepandemic (100%) with a small group (3 2%) also providing telemedicine services to a small percentage of their patients to primarily telemedicine during the initial stage of the pandemic (82 4%)  During this time some (37 37%) used only telemedicine;several (9 8%) provided only face-to-face;a few (3 9%) completely paused services;and some (47 1%) used a mix of modalities  Conclusion: Given the predominant use of telemedicine, these findings are initial evidence of the feasibility of transitioning pediatric CL psychology services to meet pandemic-specific needs  Benefits of telemedicine include continuity of care, flexibility and efficiency, and organizational benefits  There were also reported challenges that provide important areas for improvement in the continued climate of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future similar public health crises  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Implications for Impact Statement -Pediatric consultation-liaison (CL) psychologists are effective in providing brief, focused interventions across pediatric patients and their families  Considering pediatric CL psychology services during the coronavirus 2019 pandemic, it was important to collect information on how pediatric CL psychologists provided mental health services during this the initial stage of the pandemic in the United States  Findings indicated that service delivery shifted from face-to-face to telemedicine to address the patient needs and institutional guidelines, suggesting the feasibility of transitioning pediatric CL psychology services to respond to dynamic public health crises  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Steinberg, Dara M.; Schneider, Nicole M.; Guler, Jessy; Garcia, Andrea M.; Kullgren, Kristin A.; Agoston, A.; Mudd, Emily; Carter, Bryan D.; Judd-Glossy, Laura","https://doi.org/10.1037/cpp0000340","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology;2020.; Publication details: Clinical Practice in Pediatric Psychology;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5702,""

"The lonely legacy: loss and testimonial injustice in the narratives of people diagnosed with personality disorder","Purpose: This study aims to explore the lived experience of loneliness among a group of people diagnosed with the contested diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD)  In so doing, it contributes to works offering dimensional conceptualisations of personality disorders and contributes to loneliness study more broadly which has seen a rise in interest since the Covid-19 epidemic and the subsequent enforced isolation and the resultant new phenomenon of sudden loneliness  Design/methodology/approach: Participants with diagnoses of BPD were recruited through a combination of calls through online fora and announcements at self-help groups  A total of 25 people made contact, with interviews eventually being carried out with 14 of these  They were invited to take part in unstructured, recorded one-to-one interviews  Thematic analysis was used in this study, which used a narrative phenomenological approach using an Arendtian lens  Findings: Through attending to the interwoven themes in the narratives of trauma, loss and loneliness, it emerged that the enduring loneliness experienced was compounded by repeated instances of testimonial injustice  Research limitations/implications: This study supports the need for a further deepening of our understanding of the complexity of experience at the interface of loneliness and mental ill health  Practical implications: This study critiques the reductive assumptions behind websites, simplistic tool kits and training within the mental health arena dictating â€œwhat worksâ€ for loneliness  The paper argues for health professionals to develop a more nuanced listening to reported loneliness and that part of what may compound this complex experience among people diagnosed with personality disorder is epistemic injustice, rife within a climate of neoliberalism  Social implications: Neoliberalism has been identified as a key driver of distinct shifts in mental health policy and the commodification of mental health  Its fixation with medicalisation and its drive to treat â€œmental illnessâ€ as a problem within the individual positions people as self-contained agents and downplays, or worse, ignores the social, cultural and economic dimensions that contribute to the personâ€™s distress  Neoliberalismâ€™s discourse of â€œresponsibilizationâ€ for example, urges individuals that families, communities and workplaces rather than publicly funded services become the main resources to respond to in times of mental distress  This, however, assumes a concreteness to these institutions which may be illusory and leaves those in difficulty dependent on presumed immediate social circles  These circles, however, if they exist, may contain the very people who have failed individuals or subjected them to the testimonial injustices so often cited in the narratives of this research  Originality/value: The Arendtian account of loneliness rests on the premise that the human being of contemporary society is afflicted with a sense of isolation and homelessness, further exacerbated in todayâ€™s neoliberal context  By drawing on this account, the enmeshed and complex nature of mental illness, loneliness and dislocation from society and the ways in which continued epistemic injustice negatively impact on mental well-being are laid bare  Phenomenology of loneliness goes some way to helping people without the devastating life experiences common to those diagnosed, rightly or not, with a personality disorder gain a sense of the experience, and this research argues for psychological practice to be more mindful of this literature and the value of closely heard first-person narratives  Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Sagan, O.","https://doi.org/10.1108/MHSI-05-2020-0031","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Mental Health and Social Inclusion;2020.; Publication details: Mental Health and Social Inclusion;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5722,""

"The psychology of the COVID-19 pandemic: A group-level perspective","Objective: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) threatened not only people's physical health but also every aspect of their psychological well-being: from their struggle to avoid contracting the disease, to their coping with the disruption of the normal course of their lives, to the trauma they endured when the virus took the lives of those they loved  The objective of this article is to consider the group-level processes that sustain people's physical and psychological well-being during COVID-19  Method: Applying group dynamic and group therapy theory and research, we explore why COVID-19 spread so rapidly  We also explore how people cope with prolonged social isolation, distress, and social inequities, as well as how people deal with the psychological trauma of the disease, which includes heightened levels of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and complicated bereavement  Results: Researchers and theorists suggest that human beings are fundamentally social, and the need to gather with others is extremely important, especially during times of distress  The need to belong as well as the importance of reducing loneliness during uncertain times often encourages people to connect, despite recommendations to remain socially distant  Conclusions: Group treatment options developed by group psychotherapists are effective at reducing depression, anxiety, complicated grief, and stress  We conclude by examining the growing impact of online groups and the many ways that these groups help people improve their psychological well-being during the COVID-19 crisis  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Impact Statement Highlights and Implications-*Group dynamic theorists and researchers provide important contributions to the understanding of the prevention of COVID-19  Group dynamics explain why some people perceive less of a threat and why some people refuse to wear face masks or social distance  *Group psychotherapy researchers and practitioners describe the importance of group leadership, group cohesion, and the effects of loneliness and social isolation on people coping with COVID-19  *Given the mental and physical health challenges we face with COVID-19, online group and group therapy interventions are becoming more prevalent  The importance of future studies examining the effectiveness of online groups (both support and therapy) are necessary  We also need studies that examine what individual difference variables influence the effectiveness of online group interventions, such as age, race, class, ethnicity, culture, attachment style, and level of isolation  *One of the main implications of this article is that it is critical to examine the group-level factors that influence how we navigate a pandemic  Groups influence how we prevent the transmission of COVID-19, how we sustain ourselves during periods of social isolation, and how we address the effects of complicated bereavement, trauma, illness, social inequities, unemployment, anxiety, and depression  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Marmarosh, Cheri L.; Forsyth, Donelson R.; Strauss, Bernhard; Burlingame, Gary M.","https://doi.org/10.1037/gdn0000142","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice;24(3):122-138, 2020.; Publication details: Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice;24(3):122-138, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5765,""

"Study of quality of life and effectiveness of physical therapy of women after mastectomy in the COVID-19 pandemic conditions","In case of oncological disease there is a deterioration of patients' quality of life as such of its characteristics as physiological, psychological, emotional and social decrease  These problems are especially worsened by additional threats of social life  Today, such a challenge to the health of all mankind, and especially cancer patients, is the global pandemic caused by the spread of coronavirus disease COVID-19  Fear of death and loss of loved ones, isolation, economic shock and uncertainty about the future -- all this certainly affects the quality of life, especially for patients after mastectomy, because they were already in emotional and physiological stress  The problem of determining the patients' quality of life after mastectomy and correcting the nature of the personal reaction to the disease in the coronavirus pandemic is an integral part of the physical rehabilitation programme  The objective of the study: to assess the quality of life and effectiveness of physical rehabilitation programmes of women after mastectomy in the conditions of pandemic COVID-19  Research methods  The study involved 36 women aged from 42-69, who underwent radical mastectomy and were receiving adjuvant treatment at the Kherson Regional Oncological Center  To restore their health, the patients passed an author's programme of physical therapy for people after radical mastectomy  The methodology of building the author's programme was based on continuity, phasing and its implementation both in the mammology department and at home  The quality of life parameters and the volume indicators of mobility of the joints of the upper extremity were evaluated by the operated part before the application of physical therapy methods (early hospital period), after physical therapy (late hospital period) and after discharge from a hospital, but women continued to perform rehabilitation measures independently and were at home during the COVID-19 pandemic (posthospital period + quarantine)  To assess the quality of life, we used the questionnaire ""MOS SF-36"", which was used at each stage of rehabilitation  Research results  Based on the conducted goniometry of women after radical mastectomy, it can be concluded that the amplitude of movements in the shoulder joint differs significantly at all periods of physical therapy (early hospital period, late hospital period and post-hospital period + quarantine) from the standard indicators  Extension of the shoulder among most women after the application of an individual rehabilitation programme has fully recovered, forced quarantine and lack of general physical activity did not affect this indicator  Independent performance of therapeutic gymnastics (in the post-hospital period + quarantine) did not significantly improve this indicator and did not lead to complete recovery of movement  The analysis of the obtained results showed that among women, who underwent mastectomy under the influence of physical exercises, already in the late hospital period of rehabilitation, there was not only an improvement in joint mobility, but there was an improvement in quality of life  At the same time, women in the post-hospital period of physical rehabilitation, which coincided with the quarantine period, there was a slight decrease in quality of life  Namely: there was a decrease in physical activity (PF) by 4 5%, which indicated a decrease in daily physical activity;it was found that the role of physical problems in the limitation of vital functions (RF) decreased by 2 7% (this indicator reflected the impact of physical condition on daily role activities)  Low RF values indicate that daily activities are significantly limited by the patient's physical condition;women noted an increase in pain indicator (BP) by 9 6% and its effect on the ability to engage in daily activities, which led to limited activity of patients;deterioration of mental health (MH) -- by 3 8%, which was characterized by low mood, depression, anxiety and a decrease in the overall rate of positive emotions  Low scores indicated the presence of depres ive, anxious experience and mental distress;decrease of the indicator of role functioning, which is due to emotional state (RE), during forced quarantine by 13 6%, interpreted as a restriction in the performance of daily work, which is due to the deterioration of emotional state;vital activity parameters (VT) decreased during quarantine by 11 7%  The obtained indicators testified to higher fatigue of patients, decrease of their vital activity and decrease of their vivacity  Conclusions  Quarantine conditions and self-isolation, which appeared during the spread of coronavirus disease, are an additional source of concern for patients after mastectomy and have identified a decline in their quality of life and the effectiveness of physical therapy in general  Although before the quarantine measures, the indicators of quality of life and mobility of the shoulder joints on the operated side were significantly increased under the influence of the physical therapy programme for this category of patients  Assessment of the quality of life of patients after mastectomy is an integral characteristic of physical, mental, social and spiritual condition, which allows determining the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation measures  Therefore, the assessment of the life quality of women after mastectomy, which is made by the patients themselves, is a secure and reliable indicator of their general condition under normal conditions and during the pandemic period of coronavirus disease  The obtained data on the quality of life allow for constant monitoring of the patients' general condition after undergoing surgery on the mammary, as well as timely, if necessary, to adjust the physical therapy programme  [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

"When social isolation is nothing new: A longitudinal study psychological distress during COVID-19 among university students with and without preexisting mental health concerns","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on college and university campuses internationally (e g , widespread campus closures, transitions to online learning)  Postsecondary students, who were already a developmentally vulnerable population, are now facing additional new challenges, which could lead to increased mental health concerns  However, there is a paucity of research on the psychological impacts of COVID-19, or who may be most at risk, among postsecondary students  To address these gaps in the literature, we recontacted a sample of 773 postsecondary students (74% female, Mage = 18 52) who previously completed a survey on student mental health in May 2019, again in May 2020  Students filled out an online survey at both time points, reporting on their recent stressful experiences and mental health  Although we expected that students with preexisting mental health concerns would show increased psychological distress during the pandemic, this hypothesis was not supported  Instead, repeated-measures analyses demonstrated that students with preexisting mental health concerns showed improving or similar mental health during the pandemic (compared with one year prior)  In contrast, students without preexisting mental health concerns were more likely to show declining mental health, which coincided with increased social isolation among these students  Our findings underscore that colleges and universities will not only need to continue to support students with preexisting mental health needs but also prioritize early prevention and intervention programming to mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on students with increasing psychological distress, potentially stemming from increasing social isolation in response to the pandemic  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved) Abstract (French) La pandemie mondiale du coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) a eu un impact sans precedent sur les campus universitaires et collegiaux a l'echelle internationale (p  ex , fermetures de campus generalisees, transition vers l'apprentissage en ligne)  Les etudiants de niveau postsecondaire, qui forment deja une population vulnerable sur le plan developpemental, font maintenant face a de nouveaux defis supplementaires, ce qui pourrait entrainer une augmentation des inquietudes en matiere de sante mentale  Or, il y a un manque de recherche sur les impacts psychologiques de la COVID-19, ou sur les personnes qui pourraient etre les plus a risque, chez les etudiants de niveau postsecondaire  Afin de combler ces lacunes dans la litterature, nous avons contacte, de nouveau en mai 2020, un echantillon de 773 etudiants de niveau postsecondaire (74 % de sexe feminin, age median = 18,52 ans) qui avaient deja repondu a un sondage en mai 2019 sur la sante mentale des etudiants  Les etudiants ont rempli un sondage en ligne aux deux moments, faisant etat de leurs recentes experiences stressantes et de leur sante mentale  Bien que nous nous attendions a ce que les etudiants ayant des preoccupations preexistantes en matiere de sante mentale montrent une detresse psychologique accrue pendant la pandemie, cette hypothese n'a pas ete appuyee  Au lieu de cela, des analyses repetees ont demontre que les etudiants ayant des problemes preexistants de sante mentale affichaient une amelioration ou une sante mentale similaire pendant la pandemie (comparativement a un an auparavant)  En revanche, les etudiants qui n'avaient pas de problemes preexistants de sante mentale etaient plus susceptibles de presenter une diminution de la sante mentale, ce qui coincidait avec un isolement social accru chez ces etudiants  Nos resultats soulignent que les colleges et les universites auront non seulement besoin de continuer a soutenir les etudiants ayant des besoins preexistants en sante mentale, mais aussi de donner la priorite aux programmes de prevention et d'intervention precoces afin d'attenuer les repercussions de la COVID-19 sur les etudiants qui eprouvent une detresse psychologique croissante, pouvant decouler d'un isolement social croissant en reponse a la pandemie  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all

psychological impacts of COVID-19, the present study found that students without preexisting mental health concerns had greater increases in psychological distress during the pandemic  Increases in social isolation were unique to students without preexisting mental health concerns (whereas students with preexisting mental health concerns showed no change), which may account for the worsening of

"Mental-health care under threat: A pragmatic approach for ethical decision-making for practitioners in covid-19","ABSTRACT It is difficult to overstate the global impact of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak  From lockdowns to resource scarcity, the effects of the virus have been widespread and felt by all  Less obvious, but equally severe, is the impact on the practice of psychology  In this time of crisis, complex ethical challenges arise daily in our practice, many of which likely to remain with us for years to come  Thus, there is a pressing need for a pragmatic ethical framework that psychologists can use to navigate the conflicting duties and rapidly changing demands during this time of crisis  To that end, we suggest utilizing the Georgetown principles, four pragmatic ideals developed by biomedical ethicists which can aid clinicians in framing and managing ethical dilemmas  In this work, we show how these principles can be applied to complex ethical conflicts typical of clinical practice in the era of COVID-19  We will discuss ways in which the Georgetown principles are echoed in the Psychologists Code of Conduct, emphasizing items in the Code that are directly relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic  Our goal is to leave the reader with a practical ethical methodology that can be used for quick, effective, and morally sound decision-making  The goal of this paper is not to tell clinicians what decisions they should make;rather, herein we will provide clinicians with tools that will enable them to make ethically-informed decisions on their own  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)","Bar, M.; Fish, E.; Mendlovic, S.","https://doi.org/10.1080/09515070.2020.1777939","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Counselling Psychology Quarterly;2020.; Publication details: Counselling Psychology Quarterly;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5862,""

"Association of Web-Based Physical Education With Mental Health of College Students in Wuhan During the COVID-19 Outbreak: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak has affected people's health worldwide. For college students, web-based physical education is a challenge, as these course are normally offered outdoors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to use data from a web-based survey to evaluate the relationship between the mental health status of college students and their sports-related lifestyles. Problems related to web-based physical education were also examined. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted by snowball sampling from May 8 to 11, 2020. Demographic data, mental health status, and sports-related lifestyles of college students in Wuhan as well as issues related to web-based physical education were collected. Mental health status was assessed by the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21). RESULTS: The study included 1607 respondents from 267 cities. The average scores of the DASS-21 subscales (2.46 for depression, 1.48 for anxiety, and 2.59 for stress) were significantly lower in our study than in a previous study (P<.05). Lower DASS-21 scores were significantly correlated with regular exercise, maintaining exercise habits during the outbreak of COVID-19, exercising more than 1 to 2 times a week, exercise duration >1 hour, and >2000 pedometer steps (all P<.05). None of the three forms of web-based physical education was preferred by more than 50% of respondents. Frequent technical problems were confronted by 1087/1607 students (67.6%). Shape-up exercises (846/1607, 52.6%), a designed combination of exercises (710/1607, 44.2%), and Chinese kung fu (559/1607, 34.8%) were suggested sports for web-based physical education.

Exercises not meeting students' preferences, frequent technical problems, and the distant interaction involved in web-based physical education were the main problems that should be solved in future.","Deng, Cheng-Hu; Wang, Jing-Qiang; Zhu, Li-Ming; Liu, He-Wang; Guo, Yu; Peng, Xue-Hua; Shao, Jian-Bo; Xia, Wei","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21301","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(10): e21301, 2020 10 05.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(10): e21301, 2020 10 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5913,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 Epidemic on Lifestyle Behaviors and Their Association With Subjective Well-Being Among the General Population in Mainland China: Cross-Sectional Study","BACKGROUND: The world is experiencing an unprecedented challenge due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. However, it is unclear whether people's lifestyles will change as a result. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to explore perceived lifestyle changes after the outbreak of COVID-19 and their association with subjective well-being (SWB) among the general population in Mainland China. METHODS: An online survey was conducted in May 2020. Lifestyle behaviors including leisure-time physical exercise, leisure-time screen time, and dietary intake were self-reported. SWB was measured using the General Wellbeing Schedule (GWS). Other covariates including sociodemographic factors, self-rated physical health, perceived social support, and loneliness were also assessed by a structured questionnaire. A multivariate ordinal regression method was used to analyze the association between SWB and lifestyle behaviors as well as perceived lifestyle changes. RESULTS: A total of 1033 participants aged between 18 and 60 years were included in this study. The mean GWS score was 71.7 points. About 70% of the respondents reported spending more time looking at screens, whereas about 30% reported an increased frequency of vegetable and fruit intake after the outbreak of COVID-19. Inactive physical exercise (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% CI 1.02-1.48), infrequent vegetable intake (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.10-1.90), infrequent fruit intake (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01-1.70), and often skipping breakfast (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.08-1.91) were associated with lower SWB after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, self-rated physical health, perceived social support, and loneliness. Moreover, participants who perceived a decrease in the frequency of vegetable, fruit, and breakfast intake were more likely to report lower SWB. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic may have positive and negative impacts on different aspects of lifestyle behaviors. Both unhealthy lifestyle behaviors and negative lifestyle changes were associated with lower SWB. These findings provide scientific evidence that can inform lifestyle guidelines and public mental health interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Hu, Zhao; Lin, Xuhui; Chiwanda Kaminga, Atipatsa; Xu, Huilan","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21176","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(8): e21176, 2020 08 25.; Publication details: J Med Internet Res;22(8): e21176, 2020 08 25.; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus Infections; Life Style; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral; Adolescent; Adult; China/epidemiology; Coronavirus Infections/epidemiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonia, Viral/epidemiology; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5914,""
"Digital Tools to Ameliorate Psychological Symptoms Associated With COVID-19: Scoping Review","BACKGROUND: In the four months after the discovery of the index case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), several studies highlighted the psychological impact of COVID-19 on frontline health care workers and on members of the general public. It is evident from these studies that individuals experienced elevated levels of anxiety and depression in the acute phase, when they first became aware of the pandemic, and that the psychological distress persisted into subsequent weeks. It is becoming apparent that technological tools such as SMS text messages, web-based interventions, mobile interventions, and conversational agents can help ameliorate psychological distress in the workplace and in society. To our knowledge, there are few publications describing how digital tools have been used to ameliorate psychological symptoms among individuals. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to identify existing SMS text message, web-based, mobile, and conversational agents that the general public can access to ameliorate the psychological symptoms they are experiencing during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: To identify digital tools that were published specifically for COVID-19, a search was performed in the PubMed and MEDLINE databases from the inception of the databases through June 17, 2020. The following search strings were used: ""NCOV OR 2019-nCoV OR SARS-CoV-2 OR Coronavirus OR COVID19 OR COVID"" and ""mHealth OR eHealth OR text"". Another search was conducted in PubMed and MEDLINE to identify existing digital tools for depression and anxiety disorders. A web-based search engine (Google) was used to identify if the cited web-based interventions could be accessed. A mobile app search engine, App Annie, was used to determine if the identified mobile apps were commercially available. Results: A total of 6 studies were identified. Of the 6 identified web-based interventions, 5 websites (83%) could be accessed. Of the 32 identified mobile interventions, 7 apps (22%) could be accessed. Of the 7 identified conversational agents, only 2 (29%) could be accessed. RESULTS: A total of 6 studies were identified.

"[SARS-CoV-2: recommendations on nursing care for dialyzed and transplanted patient]","Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious respiratory syndrome caused by the virus called SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the family of coronaviruses. The first ever cases were detected during the 2019-2020 pandemic. Coronaviruses can cause a common cold or more serious diseases such as Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndromes (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). They can cause respiratory, lung and gastrointestinal infections with a mild to severe course, sometimes causing the death of the infected person. This new strain has no previous identifiers and its epidemic potential is strongly associated with the absence of immune response/reactivity and immunological memory in the world population, which has never been in contact with this strain before. Most at risk are the elderly, people with pre-existing diseases and/or immunodepressed, dialyzed and transplanted patients, pregnant women, people with debilitating chronic diseases. They are advised to avoid contacts with other people, unless strictly necessary, and to stay away from crowded places, also observing scrupulously the recommendations of the Istituto Superiore di SanitÃ . In this article we detail the recommendations that must be followed by the nursing care staff when dealing with chronic kidney disease patients in dialysis or with kidney transplant patients. We delve into the procedures that are absolutely essential in this context: social distancing of at least one meter, use of PPI, proper dressing and undressing procedures, frequent hand washing and use of gloves, and finally the increase of dedicated and appropriately trained health personnel on ward.","Apuzzo, Luigi; Canzi, Mara; Zito, Maria Pia; Galli, Marilena; Dente, Cristiana; Scarpo, Emiliana; Stefanizzi, Grazia; Del Pin, Marco; Fabbri, Cinzia","https://www.google.com/search?q=[SARS-CoV-2:+recommendations+on+nursing+care+for+dialyzed+and+transplanted+patient].","","Country: IT; ITÃLIA; ITALY; ITALIA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: G Ital Nefrol;37(5)2020 Oct 05.; Publication details: G Ital Nefrol;37(5)2020 Oct 05.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5917,""
"Obstetrics Healthcare Providers' Mental Health and Quality of Life During COVID-19 Pandemic: Multicenter Study from Eight Cities in Iran","Background: The coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has become the most challenging issue for healthcare organizations and governments all over the world. The lack of evidence-based data on the management of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy causes an additional stress for obstetrics healthcare providers (HCPs). Therefore, this study was undertaken to evaluate depression, perceived social support, and quality of life among obstetrics HCPs. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted in eight cities in Iran. During the study period, 599 HCPs were separated into direct, no direct, and unknown contact groups according to their exposure to COVID-19-infected pregnant patients. The Patient Health Questionaire-9 (PHQ-9), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and Short Form-36 (SF-36) were used to assess depression, perceived social support, and quality of life. Results: Obstetrics and gynecology specialists had significantly higher social functioning and general health scores compared to other HCPs (residents/students or nurses/midwives). Depression was negatively correlated with most of the domains of quality of life, regardless of the COVID-19 contact status of the study participants. Social support, however, was positively correlated with some domains of quality of life, such as physical functioning, energy/fatigue, and emotional well-being, among staff members who had either direct contact or no contact with COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 outbreak, the depression score among obstetrics HCPs was negatively associated with quality of life. Social support, however, had a reinforcing effect on quality of life.","Vafaei, Homeira; Roozmeh, Shohreh; Hessami, Kamran; Kasraeian, Maryam; Asadi, Nasrin; Faraji, Azam; Bazrafshan, Khadije; Saadati, Najmieh; Kazemi Aski, Soudabeh; Zarean, Elahe; Golshahi, Mahboobeh; Haghiri, Mansoureh; Abdi, Nazanin; Tabrizi, Reza; Heshmati, Bahram; Arshadi, Elham","https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S256780","","Country: NZ; NOVA ZELÃ‚NDIA; NEW ZEALAND; NUEVA ZELANDA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Psychol Res Behav Manag;13: 563-571, 2020.; Publication details: Psychol Res Behav Manag;13: 563-571, 2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5918,""
"From conifers to cognition: Microbes, brain and behavior","A diversity of bacteria, protozoans and viruses (""endozoites"") were recently uncovered within healthy tissues including the human brain. By contrast, it was already recognized a century ago that healthy plants tissues contain abundant endogenous microbes (""endophytes""). Taking endophytes as an informative precedent, we overview the nature, prevalence, and role of endozoites in mammalian tissues, centrally focusing on the brain, concluding that endozoites are ubiquitous in diverse tissues. These passengers often remain subclinical, but they are not silent. We address their routes of entry, mechanisms of persistence, tissue specificity, and potential to cause long-term behavioral changes and/or immunosuppression in mammals, where rabies virus is the exemplar. We extend the discussion to Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, and Toxoplasma, as well as to diverse bacteria and yeasts, and debate the advantages and disadvantages that endozoite infection might afford to the host and to the ecosystem. We provide a clinical perspective in which endozoites are implicated in neurodegenerative disease, anxiety/depression, and schizophrenia. We conclude that endozoites are instrumental in the delicate balance between health and disease, including age-related brain disease, and that endozoites have played an important role in the evolution of brain function and human behavior.","Lathe, Richard; St Clair, David","https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/gbb.12680","","Country: GB; REINO UNIDO; UNITED KINGDOM; REINO UNIDO; UK; GREAT BRITAIN; INGLATERRA; ENGLAND; ESCOCIA; SCOTLAND; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: Genes Brain Behav;: e12680, 2020 Jun 09.; Publication details: Genes Brain Behav;: e12680, 2020 Jun 09.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5919,""

The aim of this work was to know if these considerations can be fulfilled and if there are differences in their fulfillment between age groups. Method: Descriptive study aimed at people with disabilities in Argentina. A survey was conducted about the four WHO recommendations for this population in online mode, between the 28th and 39th days of preventive and compulsory social isolation. Statistical analysis was according to the nature of the variables, X2 with Fisher's correction was used to determine the differences between groups. Results: 309 surveys were collected from 18 provinces of Argentina. 230(74.4%[69.1-79.1]) were answered by caregivers and 79(25.5%[20.7-30.7]) by people with disabilities. Persons with disabilities were 138(44.7%[39.0-50.4]) children and adolescents and 171(55.3%[49.5-60.9]) adults and older adults.  People with disabilities were able to comply with the WHO recommendations regarding reducing exposure to COVID-19 and to be prepared in case of contracting it.

"Frequency and correlates of anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic in low- and middle-income countries: A multinational study","Studies have documented the significant direct and indirect psychological, social, and economic consequences of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in many countries but little is known on its impact in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) already facing difficult living conditions and having vulnerable health systems that create anxiety among the affected populations. Using a multinational convenience sample from four LMICs (DR Congo, Haiti, Rwanda, and Togo), this study aims to explore the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and associated risk and protective factors during the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 1267 individuals (40.8% of women) completed a questionnaire assessing exposure and stigmatization related to COVID-19, anxiety, and resilience. Analyses were performed to examine the prevalence and predictors of anxiety. Findings showed a pooled prevalence of 24.3% (9.4%, 29.2%, 28.5%, and 16.5% respectively for Togo, Haiti, RDC, and Rwanda, x<sup>2</sup>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 32.6, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .0001).

"Monitoring the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health: a public health challenge? Reflection on Italian data","A recent Italian report on medicines use during COVID-19 epidemic outlined a non-significant increase in outpatient pharmaceutical antidepressant consumption in March and a significant increase in anxiolytic consumption. Along with this, an analysis of psychiatric hospitalizations in Lombardy revealed a reduction in voluntary admissions in the 40Ã‚Â days after the beginning of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. Nevertheless, several studies reported a greater prevalence of depressive and anxiety symptoms in the Italian general population during the lockdown compared to before the pandemic. Furthermore, the request for psychological support by the Italian population appeared to be high during lockdown. Indeed, the Italian Ministry of Health declared that more than 50,000 calls to the telephone number for psychological support activated by the Ministry of Health and the Civil Protection because of the pandemic, with peaks during the lockdown. In addition, looking at Google Trends, the greatest searching activity for &quot;psychological support&quot; in recent years was detected the week of the 26th April 2020, followed by the week of the 22nd March 2020. We think that stronger indicators of mental health status and psychological well-being should be found to understand the long-term effects of the pandemic. The necessity of research for population-level and universal strategies is urgent, through repurposing, developing, and testing interventions to create evidence-based action plans for the entire population. Lastly, it is also essential to keep offering a psychological support suitable for all as done in past months to help individuals who have fewer opportunities to access care.","Gualano, Lo Moro, Voglino, Bert, Siliquini","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00127-020-01971-0","20201009","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5924,""

Findings indicate that reduced physical activity time and a change in sexual activity and smoking frequency are some short-term changes in behavior resulting from social isolation during the lockdown. An increase in sedentary behavior had a negative influence on mental health. For the most part, changes in behaviors in the short-term were associated with lower mental health scores.

"Immune reconstitution and clinical recovery following anti-CD28 antibody (TGN1412)-induced cytokine storm","Cytokine storm can result from cancer immunotherapy or certain infections, including COVID-19. Though short-term immune-related adverse events are routinely described, longer-term immune consequences and sequential immune monitoring are not as well defined. In 2006, six healthy volunteers received TGN1412, a CD28 superagonist antibody, in a first-in-man clinical trial and suffered from cytokine storm. After the initial cytokine release, antibody effect-specific immune monitoring started on DayÃ¢â‚¬â€°+Ã¢â‚¬â€°10 and consisted mainly of evaluation of dendritic cell and T-cell subsets and 15 serum cytokines at 21 time-points over 2Ã‚Â years. All patients developed problems with concentration and memory; three patients were diagnosed with mild-to-moderate depression. Mild neutropenia and autoantibody production was observed intermittently. One patient suffered from peripheral dry gangrene, required amputations, and had persistent Raynaud's phenomenon. Gastrointestinal irritability was noted in three patients and coincided with elevated ÃŽÂ³ÃŽÂ´T-cells. One had pruritus associated with elevated IgE levels, also found in three other asymptomatic patients. Dendritic cells, initially undetectable, rose to normal within a month. NaÃƒÂ¯ve CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells were maintained at high levels, whereas naÃƒÂ¯ve CD4<sup>+</sup> and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells started high but declined over 2Ã‚Â years. T-regulatory cells cycled circannually and were normal in number. Cytokine dysregulation was especially noted in one patient with systemic symptoms. Over a 2-year follow-up, cognitive deficits were observed in all patients following TGN1412 infusion. Some also had signs or symptoms of psychological, mucosal or immune dysregulation. These observations may discern immunopathology, treatment targets, and long-term monitoring strategies for other patients undergoing immunotherapy or with cytokine storm.","Panoskaltsis, McCarthy, Stagg, Mummery, Husni, Arebi, Greenstein, Price, Al-Hassi, Koutinas, Mantalaris, Knight","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00262-020-02725-2","20201009","Cytokine release syndrome; Cytokine storm; Immune monitoring; Immune-related adverse events (irAEs); Immunotherapy; TGN1412","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5928,""
"Anxiety levels, precautionary behaviours and public perceptions during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a population-based cross-sectional survey","To investigate psychological and behavioural responses to COVID-19 among the Chinese general population. We conducted a population-based mobile phone survey between 1 February and 10 February 2020 via random digit dialling. A total of 1011 adult residents in Wuhan (n=510), the epicentre and quarantined city, and Shanghai (n=501) were interviewed. Proportional quota sampling and poststratification weighting were used. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to investigate perception factors associated with the public responses. We measured anxiety levels using the 7-item Generalised Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and asked respondents to report their precautionary behaviours before and during the outbreak. The prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety was significantly higher (p&lt;0.001) in Wuhan (32.8%) than Shanghai (20.5%). Around 79.6%-88.2% residents reported always wearing a face mask when they went out and washing hands immediately when they returned home, with no discernible difference across cities. Only 35.5%-37.0% of residents reported a handwashing duration above 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°s as recommended by the WHO. The strongest predictor of moderate or severe anxiety was perceived harm of the disease (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5 to 2.1), followed by confusion about information reliability (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.5 to 1.9). None of the examined perception factors were associated with odds of handwashing duration above 40Ã¢â‚¬â€°s. Prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety and strict personal precautionary behaviours was generally high, regardless of the quarantine status. Our results support efforts for handwashing education programmes with a focus on hygiene procedures in China and timely dissemination of reliable information.","Qian, Wu, Wu, Hou, Liang, Cowling, Yu","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040910","20201009","health policy; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5929,""

"The radiology workforce's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East, North Africa and India","This study aimed to investigate the response of the radiology workforce to the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on professional practice in India and eight other Middle Eastern and North African countries. It further investigated the levels of fear and anxiety among this workforce during the pandemic. A quantitative cross-sectional study was conducted using an online survey from 22 May-2 June 2020 among radiology workers employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey collected information related to the following themes: (1) demographic characteristics, (2) the impact of COVID-19 on radiology practice, and (3) fear and (4) anxiety emanating from the global pandemic. We received 903 responses. Fifty-eight percent had completed training on infection control required for handling COVID-19 patients. A large proportion (79.5%) of the respondents strongly agreed or agreed that personal protective equipment (PPE) was adequately available at work during the pandemic. The respondents reported experiences of work-related stress (42.9%), high COVID-19 fear score (83.3%) and anxiety (10%) during the study period. There was a perceived workload increase in general x-ray and Computed Tomography imaging procedures because they were the key modalities for the initial and follow-up investigations of COVID-19. However, there was adequate availability of PPE during the study period. Most radiology workers were afraid of being infected with the virus. Fear was predominant among workers younger than 30 years of age and also in temporary staff. Anxiety occurred completely independent of gender, age, experience, country, place of work, and work status. It is important to provide training and regular mental health support and evaluations for healthcare professionals, including radiology workers, during similar future pandemics.","Elshami, Akudjedu, Abuzaid, David, Tekin, Cavli, Issa","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radi.2020.09.016","20201009","Anxiety; COVID-19; Fear; Radiographer; Radiology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5931,""
"Psychological well-being of Australian hospital clinical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic","ObjectiveThis study assessed the psychological well-being of Australian hospital clinical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic.MethodsAn anonymous online cross-sectional survey was conducted in a large metropolitan tertiary health service located in Melbourne, Australia. The survey was completed by nurses, midwives, doctors and allied health (AH) staff between 15 May and 10 June 2020. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 items (DASS-21) assessed the psychological well-being of respondents in the previous week.ResultsIn all, 668 people responded to the survey (nurses/midwives, n=391; doctors, n=138; AH staff, n=139). Of these, 108 (16.2%) had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. Approximately one-quarter of respondents reported symptoms of psychological distress. Between 11% (AH staff) and 29% (nurses/midwives) had anxiety scores in the mild to extremely severe ranges. Nurses and midwives had significantly higher anxiety scores than doctors (P&lt;0.001) and AH staff (P&lt;0.001). Direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis (P&lt;0.001) and being a nurse or midwife (P&lt;0.001) were associated with higher anxiety scores. Higher ratings of the health service's pandemic response and staff support strategies were protective against depression (P&lt;0.001), anxiety (P&lt;0.05) and stress (P&lt;0.001).ConclusionsThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff, particularly nurses and midwives. Staff would benefit from (additional) targeted supportive interventions during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases.What is known about the topic?The outbreak of COVID-19 is having, and will have, a considerable effect on health services. No Australian data about the effect of COVID-19 on the psychological well-being of hospital clinical staff are available.What does this paper add?Australia healthcare providers have experienced considerable emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly nurses and midwives and clinical staff who have had direct contact with people with a COVID-19 diagnosis. In this study, nurses and midwives had significantly higher levels of anxiety, depression and stress during the pandemic than general Australian adult population norms, and significantly more severe anxiety symptoms than medical and AH staff. Despite a lower number of COVID-19 cases and a lower death rate than in other countries, the proportion of Australian hospital clinical staff experiencing distress is similar to that found in other countries.What are the implications for practitioners?Targeted well-being interventions are required to support hospital clinical staff during the current and future outbreaks of infectious diseases and other 'crises' or adverse events.","Holton, Wynter, Trueman, Bruce, Sweeney, Crowe, Dabscheck, Eleftheriou, Booth, Hitch, Said, Haines, Rasmussen","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH20203","20201009","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5932,""
"Risk and resilience during COVID-19: A new study in the Zigler paradigm of developmental science","When children are exposed to serious life adversities, Ed Zigler believed that developmental scientists must expediently strive to illuminate the most critical directions for beneficial interventions. In this paper, we present a new study on risk and resilience on adolescents during COVID-19, bookended - in introductory and concluding discussions - by descriptions of programmatic work anchored in lessons learned from Zigler. The new study was conducted during the first two months of the pandemic, using a mixed-methods approach with a sample of over 2,000 students across five high schools. Overall, rates of clinically significant symptoms were generally lower as compared to norms documented in 2019. Multivariate regressions showed that the most robust, unique associations with teens' distress were with feelings of stress around parents and support received from them. Open ended responses to three questions highlighted concerns about schoolwork and college, but equally, emphasized worries about families' well-being, and positive outreach from school adults. The findings have recurred across subsequent school assessments, and strongly resonate with contemporary perspectives on resilience in science and policy. If serious distress is to be averted among youth under high stress, interventions must attend not just to the children's mental health but that of salient caregiving adults at home and school. The article concludes with some specific recommendations for community-based initiatives to address mental health through continued uncertainties of the pandemic.","Luthar, Ebbert, Kumar","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0954579420001388","20201009","COVID-19; adolescents; families; pandemic; resilience; schools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5933,""
"Factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the personal, professional and social life of Australians with some people more impacted than others. This study aimed to identify factors associated with psychological distress, fear and coping strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among residents in Australia, including patients, frontline health and other essential service workers, and community members during June 2020. Psychological distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10); level of fear was assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S); and coping strategies were assessed using the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the extent of psychological distress, level of fear and coping strategies while adjusting for potential confounders. Among 587 participants, the majority (391, 73.2%) were 30-59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old and female (363, 61.8%). More than half (349, 59.5%) were born outside Australia and two-third (418, 71.5%) completed at least a Bachelor's degree. The majority (401, 71.5%) had a source of income, 243 (42.3%) self-identified as a frontline worker, and 335 (58.9%) reported financial impact due to COVID-19. Comorbidities such as pre-existing mental health conditions (AOR 3.13, 95% CIs 1.12-8.75), increased smoking (8.66, 1.08-69.1) and alcohol drinking (2.39, 1.05-5.47) over the last four weeks, high levels of fear (2.93, 1.83-4.67) and being female (1.74, 1.15-2.65) were associated with higher levels of psychological distress. Perceived distress due to change of employment status (4.14, 1.39-12.4), alcohol drinking (3.64, 1.54-8.58), providing care to known or suspected cases (3.64, 1.54-8.58), being female (1.56, 1.00-2.45), being 30-59Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old (2.29, 1.21-4.35) and having medium to high levels of psychological distress (2.90, 1.82-5.62) were associated with a higher level of fear; while healthcare service use in the last four weeks was associated with medium to high resilience. This study identified individuals who were at higher risk of distress and fear during the COVID-19 pandemic specifically in the State of Victoria, Australia. Specific interventions to support the mental wellbeing of these individuals should be considered in addition to the existing resources within primary healthcare settings.","Rahman, Hoque, Alif, Salehin, Islam, Banik, Sharif, Nazim, Sultana, Cross","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12992-020-00624-w","20201009","COVID-19; Coping; Coronavirus; Mental health; Psychological distress; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5934,""
"Covid-19 and Priorities for Research in Aging","This article describes priority areas for research on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on older adults that have been identified by the CIHR Institute of Aging (CIHR-IA). The process used by CIHR-IA consists of several iterative phases and thus far has resulted in identification of three key areas for Covid-19 research needs and four cross-cutting thematic areas. The key research priority areas are as follows: response of older adults to disease, vaccination, and therapeutics; mental health and isolation; and supportive care environments. The four cross-cutting themes are equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI); ethical/moral considerations; evidence-informed practices; and digital health technologies. The priorities outlined in this article will inform CIHR-IA's responses to Covid-19 research needs.","Rylett, Alary, Goldberg, Rogers, Versteegh","https://doi.org/10.1017/S0714980820000331","20201009","Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Covid-19; Institut du vieillissement; Institute of Aging; Instituts de recherche en santÃƒÂ© du Canada; adultes plus ÃƒÂ¢gÃƒÂ©s; aging; older adults; priorisation de la recherche; research prioritization; vieillissement","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-10-10","",5935,""
