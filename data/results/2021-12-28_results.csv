"Loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Relationships with social media identity bubbles","Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health are a concern worldwide. This article is based on two longitudinal studies that investigated the role of social media use in loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 1 utilized nationally representative 3-point longitudinal data (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 735) collected in 2017-2020 on the Finnish population. Study 2 utilized 5-point longitudinal data (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 840) collected in 2019-2021 representing the Finnish working population. We analyzed the data using multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis. A longitudinal analysis of Study 1 showed that perceived loneliness did not increase among the Finnish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stronger involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted lower loneliness during the pandemic. Study 2 results showed that since the outbreak of the pandemic, psychological distress has increased among lonely individuals but not among the general working population. Involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted generally lower psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not buffer against higher psychological distress among lonely individuals. The findings suggest that perceived loneliness is a risk factor for prolonged negative mental health effects of the pandemic. Social media identity bubbles can offer meaningful social resources during times of social distancing but cannot protect against higher psychological distress among those who perceive themselves as often lonely.","Latikka, Koivula, Oksa, Savela, Oksanen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2021.114674","20211227","COVID-19; Loneliness; Longitudinal research; Online communities; Psychological distress; Social media; Social media identity bubbles","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24330,""
"Randomized clinical trial of a brief, scalable intervention for mental health sequelae in college students during the COVID-19 pandemic","This randomized clinical trial aimed to determine feasibility, acceptability, and initial efficacy of brief Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) skills videos in reducing psychological distress among college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over six weeks, 153 undergraduates at a large, public American university completed pre-assessment, intervention, and post-assessment periods. During the intervention, participants were randomized to receive animated DBT skills videos for 14 successive days (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 99) or continue assessment (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 54). All participants received 4x daily ecological momentary assessments on affect, self-efficacy of managing emotions, and unbearableness of emotions. The study was feasible and the intervention was acceptable, as demonstrated by moderate to high compliance rates and video ratings. There were significant pre-post video reductions in negative affect and increases in positive affect. There was a significant timeÃ‚Â Ãƒâ€”Ã‚Â condition interaction on unbearableness of emotions; control participants rated their emotions as more unbearable in the last four vs. first two weeks, whereas the intervention participants did not rate their emotions as any more unbearable. Main effects of condition on negative affect and self-efficacy were not significant. DBT skills videos may help college students avoid worsening mental health. This brief, highly scalable intervention could extend the reach of mental health treatment.","Rizvi, Finkelstein, Wacha-Montes, Yeager, Ruork, Yin, Kellerman, Kim, Stern, Oshin, Kleiman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2021.104015","20211227","Brief interventions; COVID-19; College students; Dialectical behavior therapy; Dissemination","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24331,""
"Association between positive psychological traits and changes in dietary behaviour related to first COVID-19 lockdown: A general population-based study","The spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) led many countries to implement lockdown measures, which resulted in changes in dietary behaviours that could persist over the long term and have associated health consequences. Psychological traits may impact these changes given their known association with dietary behaviours. We aimed to investigate in a population-based study, whether positive psychological traits were associated with changes of snacking behaviour and food consumption observed during the first COVID-19 lockdown period. In 2016, levels of optimism, resilience, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, mindfulness and mastery were assessed in 33,766 adults of the French NutriNet-SantÃƒÂ© cohort. Snacking and food group consumption were assessed in April-May 202. Association between psychological traits and changes (no change, increase, decrease) in snacking and food group consumption were assessed using logistic regressions. Multiple correspondence analysis followed by ascending hierarchical classification were used to derive clusters of dietary behaviours. Covariance analyses were used to compare mean scores of psychological traits between clusters. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, anxiety and depressive symptomatology. Participants with higher levels of optimism, resilience, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, mindfulness or mastery were less likely to change their snacking behaviour and food group consumption of various food groups. Individuals with lower levels were more likely to make changes, with either unhealthy (e.g.,less fruits and vegetables, more processed meat) or healthy (e.g., more pasta/rice (whole-grain)) changes. Overall, individuals showed higher levels of positive psychological traits in the ""no change"" cluster, followed by the ""healthy"" and the ""unhealthy"" cluster (all PÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.05). Individuals with higher levels of optimism, resilience, self-esteem, satisfaction with life, mindfulness or mastery were less impacted by the lockdown in terms of dietary behaviours.","Robert, Deschasaux-Tanguy, Shankland, Druesne-Pecollo, Esseddik, Szabo de Edelenyi, Baudry, Galan, Hercberg, Touvier, Bajos, Carrat, Ancel, Charles, Jusot, Martin, Meyer, PailhÃƒÂ©, Severi, Spire, Touvier, Zins, PÃƒÂ©neau","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105885","20211227","COVID-19; Dietary behaviours; Food consumption; Positive psychology; Snacking behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24332,""
"Counseling Veterans with Chronic Pain during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Controlled Trial","Veterans with chronic pain may be vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. We qualitatively explored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on a sample of Veterans receiving brief counseling focused on pain management in an ongoing clinical trial and discuss how the pandemic affected the process of motivating Veterans with chronic pain to engage in interdisciplinary multimodal pain treatment at the Department of Veteran Affairs. Segments of audio-recorded counseling sessions containing content about the pandemic were transcribed and coded to identify key concepts emerging from individual counselor-participant transactions. Themes that emerged were examined using constant comparison analysis. Three major themes emerged (1) The pandemic caused a disruption in pain management service delivery, resulting in changes to the way Veterans receive services or manage their pain symptoms. (2) The pandemic offered opportunities for resilience and personal growth as Veterans with chronic pain reflected on their life and personal goals. (3) The pandemic brought Veterans' mental health issues to the forefront, which should be addressed as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic during pain treatment counseling sessions highlighted negative and positive ways participants were affected by the pandemic. These discussions provided counselors with a unique opportunity to facilitate behavior change by focusing on characteristics of resilience to motivate individuals with chronic pain to adapt and adopt positive behaviors and outlooks to improve their pain experience and quality of life. Counselors can leverage feelings of resilience and personal growth to motivate Veterans' use of adaptive coping skills and a wider array of pain management services.","Lazar, Rosen, Sellinger, Mattocks, Navarra, Ross, Martino","https://doi.org/10.1093/pm/pnab349","20211227","COVID-19; Veterans; chronic pain; motivational interviewing; resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24333,""
"A large scale meta-analytic atlas of mental health problems prevalence during the COVID-19 early pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions can impact mental health. In order to quantify the mental health burden of COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching World Health Organization COVID-19/PsycInfo/PubMed databases (09/29/2020), including observational studies reporting on mental health outcomes in any population affected by COVID-19. Primary outcomes were the prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, sleep problems, post-traumatic symptoms. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on severe mental health problems, in high-quality studies, and in representative samples. Subgroup analyses were conducted stratified by age, sex, country income level, and COVID-19 infection status. One-hundred-seventy-three studies from February-July 2020 were included (n=502,261, median sample=948, age=34.4 years, females=63%). Ninety-one percent were cross-sectional studies, and 18.5%/57.2% were of high/moderate quality. Highest prevalence emerged for post-traumatic symptoms in COVID-19 infected people (94%), followed by behavioural problems in those with prior mental disorders (77%), fear in healthcare workers (71%), anxiety in caregivers/family members of people with COVID-19 (42%), general health/social contact/passive coping style in the general population (38%), depression in those with prior somatic disorders (37%), and fear in other-than-healthcare workers (29%). Females and people with COVID-19 infection had higher rates of almost all outcomes; college students/young adults of anxiety, depression, sleep problems, suicidal ideation; adults of fear and post-traumatic symptoms. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic symptoms were more prevalent in low-/middle-income countries, sleep problems in high-income countries. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts mental health in unique manners across population subgroups.

"Acute cardiovascular events triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic-related stress in non-infected individuals The Jordan COVID-19 Acute Cardiovascular Events (JoCORE) study","The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become an unprecedented global public health crisis and a pandemic associated with vicarious psychosocial and economic stresses. Such stresses were reported to lead to behavioral and emotional disturbances in individuals not infected with the COVID-19 virus. It is largely unknown if these stresses can trigger acute cardiovascular events (CVE) in such individuals. Covid-19-neagtive adults presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) during the COVID-19 pandemic in Jordan from March 15, 2020 through March 14, 2021 were enrolled in the study if they reported exposure to psychosocial or economic stresses related to the pandemic lockdown. Of 300 patients enrolled (mean age 58.7 Ã‚Â± 12.9 years), AMI was diagnosed in 269 (89.7%) patients, CVA in 15 (5.0%) patients, and OHCA in 16 (5.3%) patients. Triggering events were psychosocial in 243 (81.0%) patients and economic stressors in 157 (52.3%) patients. The psychosocial stresses included loneliness, hopelessness, fear of COVID-19 infection, anger, and stress-related to death of a significant person. The economic stressors included financial hardships, job loss or insecurity, volatile or loss of income. Exposure to more than one trigger was reported in 213 (71.0%) patients. In-hospital mortality of the patients admitted for AMI or CVA was 2.1%, and none of the OHCA survived the event. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a source of significant psychosocial and economic hardships that can trigger life-threatening acute CVE among individuals not infected with the virus.","Hammoudeh, Madanat, Tabbalat, Ibdah, Makhamreh, Fakhri, Khader, Mansour, Alhaddad","https://doi.org/10.31083/j.rcm2204175","20211227","Acute cardiovascular events; COVID-19 pandemic; Cardiovascular disease; Psychosocial stressors; Triggered myocardial infarction","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24336,""
"The COVID-19 Pandemic Impact on Households of Young Children With Special Healthcare Needs","This study examined how the COVID-19 pandemic differently affected households of children with versus without special healthcare needs. We compared caregivers' and children's emotional well-being (Aim 1), the utilization of preventive healthcare services for young children (Aim 2), and the promotive effects of social support on well-being outcomes (Aim 3) during the pandemic between the two groups. Data were drawn from an ongoing, large, longitudinal, and national survey that assessed the pandemic impact on households of young children (0-5). Analyses for Aims 1 and 2 were based on 10,572 households, among which 10.96% had children with special healthcare needs. Analyses for Aim 3 were based on a subsample of 821 families, among which 12.54% had children with special healthcare needs. Caregivers of children with special healthcare needs exhibited more emotional distress and reported higher levels of household children's behavioral problems during the pandemic. The percentages of missed preventive healthcare visits and vaccinations were also higher in families of children with special healthcare needs due to structural barriers. Lastly, emotional social support was indirectly related to children's decreased behavioral problems through caregivers' reduced emotional distress, only among households of children without special healthcare needs. In other words, social support alone was not sufficient in promoting caregivers' and children's better well-being outcomes among households of children with special healthcare needs. The pandemic has caused extensive burdens on families of children with special healthcare needs. Actions from policymakers and early intervention service providers are urgently needed to mitigate these impacts.","Liu, Lombardi, Fisher","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab135","20211227","COVID-19; anxiety; behavior problems; depression; health disparities and inequities; healthcare services and utilization; infancy and early childhood; parent psychosocial functioning; social support; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24337,""
"An analysis of antidepressant prescribing trends in England 2015-2019","Background Growing concerns about the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) will likely lead to increased mental health diagnoses and treatment. To provide a pre-COVID-19 baseline, we have examined antidepressant prescribing trends for 5 years preceding COVID-19. Methods A retrospective analysis of anonymised data on medicines prescribed by GPs in England from the Open-Prescribing Database (January 2015 to December 2019) identified the 10 most prescribed antidepressant and, for comparison, cardiovascular medicines. Results Prescription items for the 10 most prescribed antidepressants rose 25% from 58 million (2015) to 72 million (2019). Citalopram was the most prescribed antidepressant; prescriptions for sertraline rose fastest at 2 million items year on year. Over the same period, costs for antidepressant prescribing fell 27.8%. Across all Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) in England, antidepressant prescribing levels, adjusted for population were positively correlated with the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) score. In comparison, prescribing for the top 10 most prescribed cardiovascular medicines increased by 2.75% from 207 million (2015) to 213 million (2019) items. Limitations Anonymised data in the Open-Prescribing Database means no patient diagnoses or treatment plans are linked to this data. Conclusion Antidepressant prescribing, particularly sertraline, is increasing. Prescribing is higher in more deprived regions, but costs are falling to &lt;Ã‚Â 2% of all items prescribed. Absolute numbers of prescriptions for cardiovascular medicines are higher, likely reflecting the greater prevalence of cardiovascular disease, and are rising more slowly. This study will enable future work to look at the impact of COVID-19 on prescribing for mental health.","Lalji, McGrogan, Bailey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadr.2021.100205","20211227","Antidepressant; CCG, Clinical Commissioning Group; COVID-19, coronavirus disease 2019; Cardiovascular prescribing; Depression; General Practice; IMD, index of multiple deprivation; Mental health; NHS, National Health Service; NHSBSA, NHS Business Services Authority; SNRI, serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24338,""
"The Impact of Postponed Fertility Treatment on the Sexual Health of Infertile Patients Owing to the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> With the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic at the beginning of 2020, all non-essential medical treatments were suspended, including fertility treatments. As a unique group in society, patients with infertility may be more sensitive and vulnerable in the face of pressure and crisis. However, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the influence of postponed fertility treatment on the sexual health of infertile patients owing to COVID-19. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether postponed fertility treatment resulting from COVID-19 affects the sexual health of patients with infertility. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 1,442 participants were included for analysis in this large-scale study. Those with postponed fertility treatment were categorised as group A (<i>n</i> = 474), whereas those whose fertility treatment was not delayed were in group B (<i>n</i> = 968). The sexual health and psychological well-being were compared between the two groups. <b>Results:</b> The total Female Sexual Function Index score and five domains of female sexual function (arousal ability, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and coital pain) were significantly lower in group A than those in group B (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). The International Index of Erectile Dysfunction score and Premature Ejaculation Diagnostic Tool score were significantly higher in group A than those in group B (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Delaying fertility treatment obviously affects patients' sexual and mental health. Through a structural equation model, we observed that postponed fertility treatment mediates sexual health by regulating psychological distress and couple relationship quality.","Dong, Wu, Tao, Zhou, Tan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.730994","20211227","COVID-19; SEM; infertility; postponed fertility treatment; psychological health; sexual health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24339,""
"Occupational Stress and Mental Health Among Healthcare Workers Serving Socially Vulnerable Populations During the COVID-19 Pandemic","The purpose of this study was to analyze occupational and personal stressors, mental health indicators, perceived discrimination and help-seeking behaviors among healthcare workers and providers (HCWPs) serving socially vulnerable groups such as immigrants, refugees, farmworkers, homeless individuals, people living in poverty, and other disadvantaged populations in the United States (U.S.) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional descriptive approach, we gathered information between July and September 2020, from a sample of 407 affiliates of two national organizations of clinic-based HCWPs who worked at federally funded and community safety-net clinics. Informed consent was obtained from all participants who completed a self-administered online survey available in English and Spanish. Our results indicated that the HCWPs serving vulnerable groups in the midst of the pandemic experienced high levels of occupational and personal stressors as well as anxiety and depressive symptomology. Major occupational stressors were excessive workload, long working-hours, and institutional barriers to refer and follow-up on their clients' access to needed social services. High-rated personal stressors included sleep disorders, lack of and child-care, partner's loosing job, and other family related situations. Our findings suggest that HCWPs working with vulnerable populations need specialized interventions that bolster their mental health and well-being as the pandemic continues to unfold. We recommend implementing initiatives that encourage HCWPs' to be actively involved in clinic decisions regarding employee safety and protection as well as in management decisions to improve work place infrastructure and capacity to respond to the social needs of their clients. Lessons learned from the pandemic are useful tools in designing protocols for addressing the mental-health needs of HCWPs in health-care organizations that attend to socially underprivileged populations.","Salgado de Snyder, Villatoro, McDaniel, Ocegueda, Garcia, Parra-Medina","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.782846","20211227","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; health providers; healthcare workers; mental health; occupational stress; vulnerable groups","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24340,""
"COVID-19 Related Experiences Among College Students With and Without Disabilities: Psychosocial Impacts, Supports, and Virtual Learning Environments","This cross-sectional analysis estimated differences, based on disability status, in college students' (<i>n</i> = 777) experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were modeled using <i>t</i>-tests and logistic regression. Most participants were white (86.2%), and women (66.4%). The mode age was 23. A third (35.6%) had at least one disability. Students reported high rates of psychosocial distress, like fear of contracting (59.7%) and spreading (74.3%) COVID-19, worry about friends and family (83.7%), and increased anxiety (72.5%), depression (59.9%), and substance use (24.7%). Forty-two percent (42.2%) were scared they would miss out on their education through virtual classes. About a third feared forgetting assignments (34.1%) and making mistakes (33.9%). Fewer students expressed apprehension about (27.9%) and intimidation by (26.3%) virtual learning. Only 17.2% would continue taking virtual classes after the pandemic. Students with disabilities (<i>M</i> = 12.4, <i>SD</i> = 4.1) experienced more psychosocial stressors compared to students without disabilities (<i>M</i> = 9.9, <i>SD</i> = 4.2), [<i>t</i> <sub>(775)</sub> = 7.86, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001]. In adjusted models, disabled students were more than twice as likely to experience worry about medical bills (OR = 2.29), loneliness (OR = 2.09), and increased anxiety (OR = 2.31). They were also more than three times as likely to report increased depression (OR = 3.51) and changes in sexual activity (OR = 3.12). However, students with disabilities (<i>M</i> = 1.5, <i>SD</i> = 1.1) also reported receiving more support compared to their non-disabled classmates (<i>M</i> = 1.1, <i>SD</i> = 1.1), [<i>t</i> <sub>(775)</sub> = 6.06, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001]. Disabled students were more likely to feel a sense of contributing to society by following precautions (OR = 1.80) and receive support from family and others (emotional support: OR = 2.01, financial support: OR = 2.04). Interestingly, no significant differences were found in students' feelings associated with online or virtual learning [<i>t</i> <sub>(526.08)</sub> = 0.42, <i>p</i> = 0.68].

The weight of therapeutic safety was significantly amplified for decision-making to minimize the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Herein, the safety and effectiveness of carbon ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for unresectable liver cancer (ULC) were evaluated, and Chinese experiences were shared to solve the predicament of ULC treatment caused by SARS-CoV-2. Worldwide studies were collected to evaluate CIRT for ULC as the world has become a community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We not only searched five international databases including the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus but also performed supplementary retrieval with other sources. Chinese experiences of fighting against COVID-19 were introduced based on the advancements of CIRT in China and a prospective clinical trial of CIRT for treating ULC. A total of 19 studies involving 813 patients with ULC were included in the systematic review. The qualitative synthetic evaluation showed that compared with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), CIRT could achieve superior overall survival, local control, and relative hepatic protection. The systematic results indicated that non-invasive CIRT could significantly minimize harms to patients with ULC and concurrently obtain superior anti-cancer effectiveness. According to the Chinese experience, CIRT allows telemedicine within the hospital (TMIH) to keep a sufficient person-to-person physical distance in the whole process of treatment for ULC, which is significant for cutting off the transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, CIRT could maximize the utilization rate of hospitalization and outpatient care (UHO). Collectively, CIRT for ULC patients not only allows TMIH and the maximized UHO but also has the compatible advantages of safety and effectiveness. Therefore, CIRT should be identified as the optimal strategy for treating appropriate ULC when we need to minimize the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and to improve the capacity of medical service in the context of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.","Li, Li, Wang, Li, Chen, Jin, Liu, Dai, Liu, Zheng, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Luo, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.767617","20211227","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; carbon ion radiotherapy; liver neoplasms; medical resource; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24342,""
"Mental Disorders and Emotional Competence Among Chinese Adolescents Before and During COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Mediation Model","<b>Background:</b> The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound influence on the mental health and well-being of individuals across the globe. Emotional competence, defined as one's ability to recognize, understand, and manage their emotions, has been found linked with mental health problems (e.g., depression and anxiety) in previous studies. However, there is limited knowledge about the direction of the association between these factors among populations exposed to COVID-19. This study examined the possible mediation relationships between depression, anxiety, emotional competence, and COVID-19 exposure among Chinese adolescents. <b>Methods:</b> Responses from 7,958 Chinese adolescents who had previously taken part in a two-wave study before (December 23, 2019-January 13, 2020) and during COVID-19 (June 16, 2020-July 8, 2020) were analyzed (51.67% males, mean age = 11.74, SD = 2.15). Structural equation modeling with three covariates (i.e., age, gender, and ethnicity) was used to test the longitudinal mediation relationships between COVID-19 exposure and depression, anxiety via emotional competence. <b>Results:</b> Results indicated that the prevalence of depression (38.67 to 36.74%) and anxiety (13.02 to 12.77%) decreased from Time 1 to Time 2. The T2 emotional competence significantly mediated the relationship between T2 COVID-19 exposure and T2 anxiety (indirect effect [95% CI] = 0.011 [0.004-0.019], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). T2 emotional competence also significantly mediated the relationship between T2 COVID-19 exposure and T2 depression (indirect effect [95% CI] = 0.013 [0.005-0.022], <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05).

"Changes in Quality of Life and Loneliness Among Middle-Aged and Older Adults Participating in Therapist-Guided Digital Mental Health Intervention","<b>Background:</b> This study aimed to examine the effects of a 12-week multicomponent mobile app-delivered intervention, the Meru Health Program (MHP), on mental health quality of life (QoL) and loneliness among the middle-aged and older adults with depression symptoms. <b>Methods:</b> The eligible participants (<i>M</i> age = 57.06, <i>SD</i> = 11.26 years) were enrolled in the MHP, a therapist-supported mobile intervention. Using a non-randomized pre-post design, change in mental health QoL [WHO QoL Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) psychological health] and loneliness (UCLA Loneliness Scale) from baseline to post-treatment were examined. Time of enrollment [pre- vs. post-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)] was included as a between-subjects factor in the repeated measures analyses. <b>Results:</b> Forty-two participants enrolled prior to the COVID-19 pandemic; eight enrolled after the pandemic began.

"Anxiety, Anger and Depression Amongst Low-Income Earners in Southwestern Uganda During the COVID-19 Total Lockdown","<b>Background:</b> Low-income earners are particularly vulnerable to mental health, consequence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown restrictions, due to a temporary or permanent loss of income and livelihood, coupled with government-enforced measures of social distancing. This study evaluates the mental health status among low-income earners in southwestern Uganda during the first total COVID-19 lockdown in Uganda. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional descriptive study was undertaken amongst earners whose income falls below the poverty threshold. Two hundred and fifty-three (<i>n</i> = 253) male and female low-income earners between the ages of 18 and 60 years of age were recruited to the study. Modified generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7), Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) tools as appropriate were used to assess anxiety, anger, and depression respectively among our respondents. <b>Results:</b> Severe anxiety (68.8%) followed by moderate depression (60.5%) and moderate anger (56.9%) were the most common mental health challenges experienced by low-income earners in Bushenyi district. Awareness of mental healthcare increased with the age of respondents in both males and females.

"Efficacy of intensive CBT telehealth for obsessive-compulsive disorder during the COVID-19 pandemic","Despite evidence for the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), many individuals with OCD lack access to needed behavioral health treatment. Although some literature suggests that virtual modes of treatment for OCD are effective, it remains unclear whether intensive programs like partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient programs (PHP and IOPs) can be delivered effectively over telehealth (TH) and within the context of a global pandemic. Limited extant research suggests that clinicians perceive attenuated treatment response during the pandemic. The trajectory and outcomes of two matched samples were compared using linear mixed modeling: a pre-COVID in-person (IP) sample (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 239) and COVID TH sample (<i>n</i>Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 239). Findings suggested that both modalities are effective at treating OCD and depressive symptoms, although the pandemic TH group required an additional 2.6 treatment days. The current study provides evidence that PHP and IOP treatment delivered via TH during the COVID-19 pandemic is approximately as effective as pre-pandemic IP treatment and provides promising findings for the future that individuals with complicated OCD who do not have access to IP treatment can still experience significant improvement in symptoms through TH PHP and IOP treatment during and potentially after the pandemic.","Pinciotti, Bulkes, Horvath, Riemann","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jocrd.2021.100705","20211227","COVID-19; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Telehealth; Treatment outcomes","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24346,""
"Predictors of Weight Loss and Weight Gain in Weight Management Patients during the COVID-19 Pandemic","To examine the associations between patient struggles, health, and weight management changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. 585 patients attending a publicly funded clinical weight management program responded to an electronic survey. Over half of the patients reported worsened overall health, mental health, physical activity, or diet during the pandemic. Approximately 30% of patients lost Ã¢â€°Â¥3% of their body weight and 21% gained Ã¢â€°Â¥3% of their body weight between March and July of the pandemic. Reports of social isolation was associated with increased odds for weight loss in women (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.0, 1.2-3.3), while low motivation (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.9, 1.0-3.7), depression (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.5, 1.0-6.3), and struggles with carbohydrate intake (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.1, 1.0-4.3) were associated with weight gain. Cooking more at home/eating less take out was associated with increased likelihood of weight loss (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.1, 1.1-3.9) and lower odds for weight gain (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.2, 0.1 to 0.97). Working from home was not associated with weight loss or weight gain (<i>P</i> &gt; 0.6). The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with certain factors that may facilitate weight loss and other factors that promote weight gain.

"Insights into the impact on daily life of the COVID-19 pandemic and effective coping strategies from free-text analysis of people's collective experiences","There has been considerable speculation regarding how people cope during the COVID-19 pandemic; however, surveys requiring selection from prespecified answers are limited by researcher views and may overlook the most effective measures. Here, we apply an unbiased approach that learns from people's collective lived experiences through the application of natural-language processing of their free-text reports. At the peak of the first lockdown in the United Kingdom, 51 113 individuals provided free-text responses regarding self-perceived positive and negative impact of the pandemic, as well as the practical measures they had found helpful during this period. Latent Dirichlet Allocation identified, in an unconstrained data-driven manner, the most common impact and advice topics. We report that six negative topics and seven positive topics are optimal for capturing the different ways people reported being affected by the pandemic. Forty-five topics were required to optimally summarize the practical coping strategies that they recommended. General linear modelling showed that the prevalence of these topics covaried substantially with age. We propose that a wealth of coping measures may be distilled from the lived experiences of the general population. These may inform feasible individually tailored digital interventions that have relevance during and beyond the pandemic.","Hampshire, Hellyer, Trender, Chamberlain","https://doi.org/10.1098/rsfs.2021.0051","20211227","COVID-19; free text; mental health; pandemic; pragmatic interventions; topic modelling","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24348,""
"Overlapping but Disparate Inflammatory and Immunosuppressive Responses to SARS-CoV-2 and Bacterial Sepsis: An Immunological Time Course Analysis","Both severe SARS-CoV-2 infections and bacterial sepsis exhibit an immunological dyscrasia and propensity for secondary infections. The nature of the immunological dyscrasias for these differing etiologies and their time course remain unclear. In this study, thirty hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection were compared with ten critically ill patients with bacterial sepsis over 21 days, as well as ten healthy control subjects. Blood was sampled between days 1 and 21 after admission for targeted plasma biomarker analysis, cellular phenotyping, and leukocyte functional analysis <i>via</i> enzyme-linked immunospot assay. We found that circulating inflammatory markers were significantly higher early after bacterial sepsis compared with SARS-CoV-2. Both cohorts exhibited profound immune suppression through 21 days (suppressed HLA-DR expression, reduced mononuclear cell IFN-gamma production), and expanded numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In addition, MDSC expansion and <i>ex vivo</i> production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were resolving over time in bacterial sepsis, whereas in SARS-CoV-2, immunosuppression and inflammation were accelerating. Despite less severe initial physiologic derangement, SARS-CoV-2 patients had similar incidence of secondary infections (23% vs 30%) as bacterial sepsis patients. Finally, COVID patients who developed secondary bacterial infections exhibited profound immunosuppression evident by elevated sPD-L1 and depressed HLA-DR. Although both bacterial sepsis and SARS-CoV-2 are associated with inflammation and immune suppression, their immune dyscrasia temporal patterns and clinical outcomes are different. SARS-CoV-2 patients had less severe early inflammation and organ dysfunction but had persistent inflammation and immunosuppression and suffered worse clinical outcomes, especially when SARS-CoV-2 infection was followed by secondary bacterial infection.","Loftus, Ungaro, Dirain, Efron, Mazer, Remy, Hotchkiss, Zhong, Bacher, Starostik, Moldawer, Brakenridge","https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.792448","20211227","ELISpot; MDSC; immune response; immune suppression; inflammation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24349,""
"Risk and Protective Factors for the Mental Wellbeing of Deployed Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Pandemic in China: A Qualitative Study","<b>Background:</b> Though many literatures documented burnout and occupational hazard among healthcare workers and frontliners during pandemic, not many adopted a systemic approach to look at the resilience among this population. Another under-studied population was the large numbers of global healthcare workers who have been deployed to tackle the crisis of COVID-19 pandemic in the less resourceful regions. We investigated both the mental wellbeing risk and protective factors of a deployed healthcare workers (DHWs) team in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak during 2020. <b>Method:</b> A consensual qualitative research approach was adopted with 25 DHWs from H province through semi-structured interviews after 3 months of deployment period. <b>Results:</b> Inductive-Deductive thematic coding with self-reflexivity revealed multi-layered risk and protective factors for DHWs at the COVID-19 frontline. Intensive working schedule and high-risk environment, compounded by unfamiliar work setting and colleagues; local culture adaptation; isolation from usual social circle, strained the DHWs. Meanwhile, reciprocal relationships and ""familial relatedness"" with patients and colleagues; organizational support to the DHWs and their immediate families back home, formed crucial wellbeing resources in sustaining the DHWs. The dynamic and dialectical relationships between risk and protective factors embedded in multiple layers of relational contexts could be mapped into a socio-ecological framework. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our multidisciplinary study highlights the unique social connectedness between patient-DHWs; within DHWs team; between deploying hospital and DHWs; and between DHWs and the local partners.

"Cross-Lagged Analysis of COVID-19-Related Worry and Media Consumption in a Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Sample of Community Adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in an array of mental health problems. Previous research has shown that media exposure to stressful situations is often related to anxiety and stress. However, given that most existing work has used cross-sectional designs, less is known about the interplay of media exposure and worry as they unfold during sustained exposure to a collective stressor. The current study examined bidirectional associations between COVID-related worry and media consumption over a three-month period. Participants were 87 community adults, the majority of whom were recruited from communities heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. For three consecutive months, participants asked to indicate how much time they spent worrying and consuming news about the COVID-19 pandemic on a scale from 1 (""never"") to 5 (""most of the day""). Cross-lagged analyses revealed that Pandemic Worry at Month 1 predicted increases in Pandemic Media Consumption at Month 2, which in turn predicted increases in Pandemic Worry at Month 3. Findings suggest that media consumption may be a maladaptive coping strategy that has the iatrogenic effect of increasing worry.

"Loneliness in Young Adults During the First Wave of COVID-19 Lockdown: Results From the Multicentric COMET Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental and physical health of the general population at any age, but it is expected to have a protracted and severe consequences for younger populations. The pandemic has had several consequences on mental health including anger and irritability, depressive symptoms and somatic complaints, insomnia, lack of motivation, and loneliness. In particular, loneliness and its related negative feelings are thought to be particularly pronounced during young adulthood because of the many social changes that young people deal with during this period of life. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate the type of impact of the pandemic on the mental health of young people and their levels of loneliness experienced during the first phase of the lockdown. Based on the largest Italian study on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of general population, in this paper we aim to: (1) describe the levels of loneliness in a national sample of Italian young adults aged 18-34 years, during the first wave of lockdown in 2020; (2) evaluate the clinical and socio-demographic differences in young adults reporting low vs. high levels of loneliness; (3) assess the role of clinical symptomatology, coping strategies, levels of resilience, and duration of lockdown as possible predictors of loneliness. The final sample consists of 8,584 people, mainly female (72.6%), single, with a mean age of 26.4 (Ã‚Â±4.4) years. The mean score at the UCLA was 47.5 (Ã‚Â±13.6), with 27% (<i>N</i> = 2,311) of respondents exceeding the cut-off for high levels of loneliness. High levels of loneliness were predicted by the presence of avoidant coping strategies, such as self-distraction (Beta coefficient, B = 0.369, 95% Confidence Interval, CI = 0.328-0.411), venting (B = 0.245, 95% CI = 0.197-0.293), denial (B = 0.110, 95% CI = 0.061-0.159), and emotional disengagement (B = 0.133, 95% CI = 0.080-0.185). Weeks of exposure to the pandemic were significantly associated with worsening of loneliness (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.000). There is currently considerable interest in trying to reduce loneliness, both within the context of COVID-19 and more generally.

In the face of school closures, academic disruptions, and constraints on social gatherings, it is crucial to understand the extent to which mental health among post-secondary students has been impacted in order to inform support implementation for this population. The present meta-analysis examines the global prevalence of clinically significant depression and anxiety among post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several moderator analyses were also performed to examine sources of variability in depression and anxiety prevalence rates. A systematic search was conducted across six databases on May 3, 2021, yielding a total of 176 studies (1,732,456 participants) which met inclusion criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses of 126 studies assessing depression symptoms and 144 studies assessing anxiety symptoms were conducted. The pooled prevalence estimates of clinically elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms for post-secondary students during the COVID-19 pandemic was 30.6% (95% CI: 0.274, 0.340) and 28.2% (CI: 0.246, 0.321), respectively. The month of data collection and geographical region were determined to be significant moderators. However, student age, sex, type (i.e., healthcare student vs. non-healthcare student), and level of training (i.e., undergraduate, university or college generally; graduate, medical, post-doctorate, fellow, trainee), were not sources of variability in pooled rates of depression and anxiety symptoms during the pandemic. The current study indicates a call for continued access to mental health services to ensure post-secondary students receive adequate support during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> PROSPERO website: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42021253547.","Zhu, Racine, Xie, Park, Watt, Eirich, Dobson, Madigan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.777251","20211227","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; post-secondary students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24355,""
"Pre-pandemic Predictors of Loneliness in Adult Men During COVID-19","Loneliness is a major public health issue, with its prevalence rising during COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and mandated ""social distancing"" practices. A 2020 global study (<i>n</i> = 46,054) found that, in comparison to women, men experienced the greatest levels of loneliness. Although research on predictors of loneliness during COVID-19 is increasing, little is known about the characteristics of men who may be particularly vulnerable. Studies using prospective data are needed to inform preventative measures to support men at risk of loneliness. The current study draws on rare longitudinal data from an Australian cohort of men in young to mid-adulthood (<i>n</i> = 283; aged <i>M</i> = 34.6, SD = 1.38 years) to examine 25 pre-pandemic psychosocial predictors of loneliness during COVID-19 social restrictions (March-September 2020). Adjusted linear regressions identified 22 pre-pandemic predictors of loneliness across a range of trait-based, relational, career/home and mental health variables. Given the extensive set of predictors, we then conducted penalized regression models (LASSO), a machine learning approach, allowing us to identify the best fitting multivariable set of predictors of loneliness during the pandemic. In these models, men's sense of pre-pandemic environmental mastery emerged as the strongest predictor of loneliness. Depression, neuroticism and social support also remained key predictors of pandemic loneliness (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 26, including covariates). Our findings suggest that men's loneliness can be detected prospectively and under varying levels of social restriction, presenting possible targets for prevention efforts for those most vulnerable.","Mansour, Greenwood, Biden, Francis, Olsson, Macdonald","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.775588","20211227","COVID-19; loneliness; longitudinal; male; pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24356,""
"Analysis of Anxiety and Depression Status in Patients Undergoing Radiotherapy During the COVID-19 Epidemic","<b>Background:</b> The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) had caused a global pandemic and disrupted millions of lives. Cancer patients are a special group at greater risk of contracting viruses. This study aimed to evaluate the anxiety and depression status of cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy during the COVID-19 epidemic. <b>Methods:</b> 396 cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy were enrolled in this study. The self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and self-rating depression scale (SDS) were used to evaluate patient anxiety and depression, respectively. 373 cancer patients completed the questionnaires. <b>Results:</b> During the COVID-19 outbreak, the incidence of anxiety and depression in cancer patients were 34.9 and 33.8%, respectively. Approximately 31.4% of tumor radiotherapy patients had anxiety and depression. Based on univariate analysis, age, work status, education level, and clinical stage were related to anxiety and depression in cancer patients. Based on multiple regression analysis, age and clinical stage were related to anxiety, but only age was related to depression. <b>Conclusions:</b> Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer patients experienced increased psychological problems. Our results have contributed to a better understanding of these psychological problems in cancer patients and provide a basis for psychological counseling and intervention.","Yang, Yang, He, Zhou, Zhang, Sun, Gao, Qian","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.771621","20211227","COVID-19; anxiety; cancer patients; depression; stressors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24357,""
"Financial Difficulties Correlate With Mental Health Among Bangladeshi Residents Amid COVID-19 Pandemic: Findings From a Cross-Sectional Survey","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic is a global threat which has challenged mental resilience and impacted the psychological well-being of people across all age groups globally. The present study aimed to investigate how financial difficulties during the pandemic correlate with mental health among residents of Bangladesh. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 4,020 residents from different parts of Bangladesh between July and September 2020, during a period of elevated risk of COVID-19 infection. A self-reported online questionnaire comprising socio-demographic, financial difficulties and psychometric measures (to assess depression, anxiety and stress) was used to gather information from participants. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the factors associated with mental health consequences. <b>Results:</b> The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in the sample were 71.1%, 62.3%, and 56.7%, respectively. Levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were significantly higher among participants who reported female sex, being unmarried, smaller families, higher monthly family income, poor self-perceived health status, living near people who had been infected by COVID-19, probability of decreased income, food scarcity (both during the pandemic and in the future) and the possibility of unemployment. However, due to the nature of the cross-sectional study performed with a convenience sampling method, the causal relationship between variables cannot be justified. <b>Conclusions:</b> After several months of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh, more than half of the respondents rated their mental health concerns as moderate to severe. The findings highlight the contributing factors of poor mental health which warrant the creation of interventions that address the economic, financial and mental health impacts of the pandemic.","Siddique, Nath, Islam, Khan, Pardhan, Amin, Amin, Shawon, Koly","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.755357","20211227","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; financial difficulties; mental health; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24358,""
"Psychosocial Factors Associated With Increased Adolescent Non-suicidal Self-Injury During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) in adolescents hospitalized with psychiatric disorders continues to increase after the outbreak of COVID-19. This study aimed to explore the relationship between the pandemic and NSSI among adolescents and whether the composition of psychosocial factors related to NSSI has changed during the pandemic. Through the retrospective analysis of medical records retrieved from the electronic system of the psychiatric hospital located in Chengdu from January 2016 to March 2021, 609 medical records of adolescents were obtained. The main potential psychosocial factors were determined by deductive content analysis. Among the 609 adolescents, 420 subjects had engaged in NSSI, while 189 did not. We found that the percentage of adolescents who had engaged in NSSI in 2016 was only 29.2%, reaching 34.5% in 2017, 45.7% in 2018, 61.3% in 2019, 92.5% in 2020, and 95.9% in 2021. In the binary logistic regression model, female sex (OR = 0.073, 95% CI: 0.028-0.186), older age (OR = 1.234, 95% CI: 1.030-1.478), having a single parent (OR = 7.865, 95% CI: 3.997-15.476), having experienced trauma (OR = 2.192, 95% CI: 1.032-4.654), having experienced social isolation from peers (OR = 8.139, 95% CI: 4.037-16.408), having experienced body-focused bullying (OR = 3.078, 95% CI: 1.295-7.318), overuse of a mobile phone in the parents' opinions (OR = 4.354, 95% CI: 1.380-13.738), having attempted suicide (OR = 9.120, 95% CI: 4.492-18.512), and during the pandemic (time point is January 30, 2020) (OR = 5.399, 95% CI: 1.679-17.357) were the factors that were significantly associated with NSSI. When comparing the differences in psychosocial factors between the pre-pandemic and the during-pandemic groups, the results showed that the family constitution, parent-child relationships, mobile phone overuse, and stressful learning were important factors.

"Bidirectional Associations Between Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms and Loneliness During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Dynamic Panel Models With Fixed Effects","<b>Background:</b> Understanding the direction and magnitude of mental health-loneliness associations across time is important to understand how best to prevent and treat mental health and loneliness. This study used weekly data collected over 8 weeks throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to expand previous findings and using dynamic panel models with fixed effects which account for all time-invariant confounding and reverse causation. <b>Methods:</b> Prospective data on a convenience and snowball sample from all 50 US states and the District of Colombia (<i>n</i> = 2,361 with Ã¢â€°Â¥2 responses, 63.8% female; 76% retention rate) were collected weekly <i>via</i> online survey at nine consecutive timepoints (April 3-June 3, 2020). Anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness were assessed at each timepoint and participants reported the COVID-19 containment strategies they were following. Dynamic panel models with fixed effects examined bidirectional associations between anxiety and depressive symptoms and loneliness, and associations of COVID-19 containment strategies with these outcomes. <b>Results:</b> Depressive symptoms were associated with small increases in both anxiety symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.065, 95% CI = 0.022-0.109; <i>p</i> = 0.004) and loneliness (ÃŽÂ² = 0.019, 0.008-0.030; <i>p</i> = 0.001) at the subsequent timepoint. Anxiety symptoms were associated with a small subsequent increase in loneliness (ÃŽÂ² = 0.014, 0.003-0.025; <i>p</i> = 0.015) but not depressive symptoms (ÃŽÂ² = 0.025, -0.020-0.070; <i>p</i> = 0.281). Loneliness was strongly associated with subsequent increases in both depressive (ÃŽÂ² = 0.309, 0.159-0.459; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) and anxiety (ÃŽÂ² = 0.301, 0.165-0.436; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) symptoms. Compared to social distancing, adhering to stay-at-home orders or quarantining were not associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms or loneliness (both <i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¥ 0.095). <b>Conclusions:</b> High loneliness may be a key risk factor for the development of future anxiety or depressive symptoms, underscoring the need to combat or prevent loneliness both throughout and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

"Case Report: COVID-19 Infection With Gastrointestinal Symptoms and Mood Disorder: Criticalities in Differential Diagnosis, Therapy and Management of Complications","During this pandemic Italy was deeply hit by the burden of the COVID-19. Current studies reveal that respiratory symptoms of COVID-19 represent the most common manifestations at presentation. The incidence of less common gastrointestinal symptoms varies significantly among different study populations. Liver injury is also described at different degree. We describe the case of a 20-year-old woman confirmed as SARS-CoV-2 positive by nasopharyngeal swab-PCR test, admitted to the COVID-only-Psychiatric Ward, set up in Niguarda Hospital in Milan on March 2020, for a depressive episode characterized by depressed mood and anorexia. In comorbidity we report a previous avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder present since childhood and a Border Personality Disorder according to the DSM V. On the admission to the ward we administered the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a total score of 29 suggesting severe depression. During the hospitalization she developed a clinical picture with increasing vomiting and diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain along with fever and no respiratory symptoms. She also showed abnormalities in liver function indices. At the same time she showed clinophilia and persistent food avoidance that, initially, led to attribute all the symptoms to her psychiatric disorders. We prescribed the already ongoing therapy with lithium carbonate and SSRI. On the second day of hospitalization, along with the worsening of the gastrointestinal symptoms, we started therapy with hydroxychloroquine with a no significant remission of nausea and vomiting but with a further increase in liver function indices suggesting liver damage. This led us to suspend the treatment with hydroxychloroquine for the suspect of a drug induced injury. The depressive symptoms improved rapidly as opposed to the patient's overall condition. The gastrointestinal symptoms resolved with the evidence of the recovery from infection. In this report we underline the importance of investigating the physical symptoms in a patient with a history of mental disorder especially during an undergoing pandemic. During this pandemic, specialists from various fields were called upon to support teams working with COVID patients and to acquire new skills out of necessity, fostering a multidisciplinary approach and cooperation.","Borriello, Lavatelli, Ruzzi, Panariello, Percudani","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.568553","20211227","COVID pandemic; eating disorder; gastrointestinal; liver injury; mood disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24361,""
"Liaison Psychiatry During the Peak of the Coronavirus Pandemic: A Description of Referrals and Interventions","<b>Introduction:</b> The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the coronavirus family, a group of viruses that can cause upper respiratory infections in humans. Among other symptoms, it can present as an asymptomatic infection or as a more severe disease requiring hospitalization. Neuropsychiatric symptoms have been described in the acute phase of the illness and as long-term repercussions. We describe the characteristics and interventions in those COVID-19 patients referred to our liaison psychiatry service. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. This study was carried out within the Department of Psychiatry of Cruces University Hospital (Basque Country, Spain). Data from each psychiatric consultation within our consultation-liaison service were consecutively obtained for 1 month from March 17 to April 17, 2020. We recruited data regarding clinical and referral characteristics and psychiatric interventions. <b>Results:</b> Of a total of 721 SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations, 43 (5.6%) patients were referred to our psychiatry liaison service. The median age was 61 years old, and 62.8% were women. The infectious disease department was the most frequent petitioner (37.2%), and the most common reason for referral was patient anxiety (25.6%). A total of 67.4% of patients received psychological counseling and 55.8% received some pharmacological approach, with a median of 3.7 visits/calls per patient. In addition, 20.3% needed a medication switch due to potential interactions between psychotropics and drugs used to treat SARS-CoV-2. <b>Discussion:</b> In our study, up to 5.6% of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalized patients needed a psychiatric evaluation, especially for anxiety and mood symptoms.

"Can parkland mitigate mental health burden imposed by the COVID-19? A national study in China","The worldwide coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously affected not only physical health but also mental wellbeing (i.e mental stress and suicide intention) of numerous urban inhabitants across the globe. While many studies have elucidated urban parkland enhances and mental wellbeing of urban residents, the potential for parkland to mitigate mental health burden imposed by the COVID-19 has received no attention. This nationwide study systematically explored the association between parkland, the COVID-19 pandemic situation and mental wellbeing from 296 cities in China. The study innovatively used big data from Baidu Search Engine to assess city-level mental wellbeing, thereby enabling comparisons among cities. The results show that the provision of parkland is positively associated with mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 epidemic. For COVID-19-related indicators, the geographical distance to Wuhan city, work resumption rate, and travel intensity within the city are also positively associated with mental wellbeing, while the number of COVID-19 infections and the proportion of migrants from Hubei Province for each city are negatively associated with mental wellbeing. Last, the most important finding is that parkland reduces the negative effect of COVID-19 on mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 epidemic. To achieve the goal of promoting mental wellbeing through urban planning and design during the future pandemics, policymakers and planners are advised to provide more well-maintained and accessible parkland and encourage residents to use them with proper precautions.","Yao, Lu, Guan, Wang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2021.127451","20211227","Big data; Buffer effect; COVID-19; Mental wellbeing; Parkland","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24364,""

We found heterogeneity in mental health changes, with 5 distinct patterns of change for mothers and 4 distinct patterns of change for children during COVID-19. The majority (83%) of mothers experienced significant declines in at least one aspect of mental health. In contrast, the majority of children (65%) experienced either no change or improvements in mental health. Interestingly, patterns of change across these groups were not differentiated by demographic characteristics such as income, education and family composition. However, for mothers, a higher degree of satisfaction with social support was associated with membership in a profile with better mental health both prior to and during the pandemic. For children, having a stable history of early childhood education and care was associated with membership in a profile that showed improvements in mental health during the pandemic. We discuss how our results support the need for proactive and global interventions for at-risk families with raised mental health concerns, and the benefits that stable early childhood education and care may provide for young children.","Saleem, Burns, Falenchuk, Varmuza, Perlman","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecresq.2021.12.004","20211227","COVID-19, maternal and child mental health; childcare instability; latent profile analysis; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24366,""

Design: Participants (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°396, 74% women) completed three waves of a web-based survey during the lockdown. Age mean was 40.11 (<i>sd</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.66). Participants answered a set of sociodemographic data, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), and the Measures of Affect Regulation Scale (MARS). Disruptions and withdrawal were associated with more mental health symptoms (between 39% and 41% mental distress). Growth models showed that social dysfunction increased over time while dysphoric symptoms decreased. The use of withdrawal aggravated social dysfunction symptoms. Young people who use more withdrawal experienced more social dysfunction and dysphoria over time than those who used less withdrawal strategies. The differential trends in social dysfunction versus dysphoria symptoms suggest an adaptation process after the initial stress of the lockdown. Older age was correlated with less mental health problems and reflects age related improvements in emotional regulation.","Ubillos-Landa, Puente-MartÃƒÂ­nez, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Castro","https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2021.2019254","20211227","COVID-19; Social dysfunction; age; dysphoria; withdrawal","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24368,""
"Pandemic-associated mental health changes in youth with neuroinflammatory disorders","Children with neuroinflammatory disorders have high rates of anxiety and depression, alongside low rates of physical activity. Given general concerns for mental and physical health in children during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, here we sought to understand how sleep, anxiety, depression, and physical activity changed with the lockdown in children with neuroinflammatory disorders. We hypothesized that outcomes would worsen during the lockdown, and that they would differ by underlying disorder category and age. Patients attending a specialized neuroinflammatory clinic (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 314) completed questionnaires (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 821 responses; Jan 2017-Aug 2020) assessing sleep, anxiety, depression, and physical activity. Respondents had either: childhood-onset chronic or recurrent neuroinflammatory disorders (CRNI), a history of Autoimmune Encephalitis (AE) or Monophasic Acquired Demyelinating Syndromes (monoADS). We performed linear mixed models to examine the association between our outcome measures (sleep, anxiety, depression, and physical activity) and categories of disorder type, sex, age, physical activity, relapses, and time (pre- vs. post- COVID-19 lockdown). Participant ID acted as a random effect, to account for repeated measures. Sleep significantly increased in the first 6 months of the COVID-19 lockdown (F<sub>(1, 544)</sub>=56.85, P&lt;0.001,). Across the whole group, anxiety and depression did not change with the pandemic, but we found differing trends by age category. Anxiety decreased in teenagers (Ã¢â€°Â¥13y) (ZÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 3.96, P&lt;0.001), but not for pre-teens. Depression remained higher in teenagers than preteens across both timepoints (F<sub>(1, 597)</sub>=6.30, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.012). Physical activity levels did not change with the pandemic in comparison to pre-pandemic (F<sub>(1, 629)</sub>=1.92, PÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.166). Anxiety was higher in inactive individuals regardless of timing (F<sub>(2, 547)</sub>=3.74, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.024). For youth with neuroinflammatory disorders, the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown resulted in increased hours of nighttime sleep but did not result in significant overall changes in self-reported anxiety or depression. Pre-lockdown, teenagers had higher depression and anxiety scores than preteens. Post-lockdown, anxiety and depression scores decreased in teenagers compared to pre-teens. Physical activity was low both pre- and post-lockdown, and rates of anxiety were higher for inactive participants at both timepoints. Differences based on age suggest that younger children (&lt;13 years) were more negatively affected by the pandemic than older children (Ã¢â€°Â¥ 13 years).","Logan, Stephens, Ciftci-Kavaklioglu, Berenbaum, Ly, Longoni, Yeh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.msard.2021.103468","20211226","Mental health; Neuroinflammatory disorders; Pandemic; Pediatric; Physical activity; Sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24369,""

"Transitions to virtual early childhood home visitation during COVID-19","COVID-19 has disrupted many of the preventive service sectors designed to promote infant mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine provider and supervisor transition strategies as well as maternal-child outcomes during the transition from in-person to virtual early childhood home visitation services in Los Angeles County. Los Angeles County is one of the largest home visitation sectors in the U.S. and disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Transitioning from in-person to virtual home visitation was an important step in ensuring the continuity of infant mental health services. Home visitors reported relative ease in transitioning to virtual services themselves but noted that families encountered greater difficulty. The most helpful strategies to support this transition included training, ongoing reflective supervision, and provision of technology. Family level analysis revealed that positive screening rates for anxiety and depression decreased during the pandemic as did referrals for most support services. These findings likely highlight challenges in delivering virtual home visitation. Understanding how transitions in a key infant serving sector were managed serves an important role in forecasting for the future and preparing for future public heath emergencies.","Traube, Gozalians, Duan","https://doi.org/10.1002/imhj.21957","20211225","COVID-19; family needs; home visitation; parental mental health; virtual home visitation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24374,""

"Provocation of dry eye disease symptoms during COVID-19 lockdown","To assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on dry-eye symptoms in a community-based population, a cross-sectional study was conducted during the first wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand. An online survey was distributed via social media between June and July 2020. The questionnaire elicited information on demographics, dry-eye symptoms, use of visual display terminals, and mental health status. There were 535 respondents. Thirty-seven percent reported having been diagnosed with dry-eye disease (DED). During the lockdown, the mean dry-eye symptom score (DESS) of overall participants dropped significantly from 81.6Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°15.9 to 79.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°17.4 (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001).

"A longitudinal seizure outcome following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021: Transient exacerbation or sustainable mitigation","To study the longitudinal seizure outcomes of people with epilepsy (PWE) following the acute and chronic phases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Consecutive PWE who were treated at the epilepsy center of Hiroshima University Hospital between 2018 and 2021 were enrolled. We evaluated the incidence of seizure frequency increase or decrease following the pandemic during observational periods in 2020 and 2021. Data between 2018 and 2019 were used as a control set. The sustainability of the altered seizure frequency condition was evaluated throughout the study period. We analyzed the clinical, psychological, and social factors associated with PWE with seizure exacerbation or amelioration. Among the 223 PWE who were evaluated (mean age 37.8Ã‚Â Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â 16.3Ã‚Â years), seizure frequency increased for 40 (16.8%) and decreased for 34 (15.2%) after the pandemic began. While seizure exacerbation tended to be a transient episode during 2020, seizure amelioration was likely to maintain excellent status over the observation periods; the sustainability of the altered seizure frequency condition was more prominent for amelioration than exacerbation (pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001).

"n2Longitudinal trajectories of depression and anxiety among adolescents during COVID-19 lockdown in China","This study examines the patterns and predictors of depression and anxiety trajectories among adolescents during COVID-19 lockdown in China. A total of 35516 college students were followed from the pandemic outbreak period, initial remission period, and control period. Participants completed the Patient Heath Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Perceived Social Support Scale, the Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and APGAR-family scale. Distinct patterns of depression and anxiety trajectories were established through grouping participants based on time-varying changes of the cut-off score. Multivariate logistic regressions were used to examine predictors for trajectory membership. Depression and anxiety prevalence during the COVID-19 outbreak were 21.3% and 11.5% respectively, and symptoms worsened as the lockdown time increased. Five depression/anxiety trajectories were observed: resistance, recovery, relapsing/remitting, delayed-dysfunction and chronic-dysfunction. Gender, academic year, residence location, history of mental health, and COVID-19 community exposure were significant predictors of distinct trajectories for depression or anxiety. Less social support or positive coping, more negative coping, and poorer family function were also risk predictors for not developing delayed or chronic dysfunction. Although most adolescents remain euthymic or recover over time, some adolescents, especially those with the risk factors noted above, exhibit delayed or chronic symptoms. Thus, the need for individualized intervention with these adolescents is indicated.","Wang, Zhao, Ross, Ma, Zhang, Fan, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.086","20211224","COVID-19; Longitudinal studies; anxiety; depression; trajectories","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24379,""
"Irritability and mental health profiles among children and adolescents: A result of latent profile analysis","Irritability is a transdiagnostic symptom that accompanies both internalizing and externalizing problems. However, there has been a scarcity of research concerning the relationships between irritability and the mental health profiles among children and adolescents. This study aimed to identify latent profiles in children and adolescents using anxiety, depression, oppositionality, and irritability. In addition, the profiles were further examined in their relationships with mental health symptoms. The study analyzed data from 1,867 children and adolescents aged 6-15 years from the COVID-19 Online-Survey for Children and Adolescents in Japan (J-COSCA). Parent-reported questionnaires were used in this study. A latent profile analysis detected five latent profiles. High oppositionality characterized the first profile (""oppositional"": nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯405, 22%). High levels of depression and other less pronounced symptoms characterized the second profile (""depressed"": nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯276, 15%). The third profile (""average"": nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯602, 33%) presented average symptoms of anxiety, depression and oppositionality and low irritability. The fourth profile (""well-adjusted"": nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯235, 13%) presented low values for all the applicable symptoms. The last profile (""comorbid"": nÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯308, 17%) exhibited high values for all the symptoms and the highest level of irritability of the five profiles. We analyzed the data from a community sample alone after capturing it using parent-reported questionnaires.

This study aimed to (1) identify factors and characteristics associated with fear of COVID-19, (2) investigate the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and maternal anxiety and depression, and (3) determine the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and pregnancy outcomes. 9251 pregnant Canadians were recruited between April - December 2020. Participants self-reported (scale of 0-100) the degree of threat they perceived from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in relation to themselves and their unborn baby. Mean fear scores indicated moderate to elevated concern. In multivariable linear regression, fear of COVID-19 was associated with food insecurity, ethnicity, geographic location, history of anxiety prior to pregnancy, having a chronic health condition, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, and stage of pregnancy at study enrollment. Higher COVID-19 fear was associated with increased odds of depression, adjusted odds ratio (aOR)Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 1.75, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 1.66-1.85, and anxiety, aOR=2.04, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 1.94-2.15). Furthermore, fear of COVID-19 was associated with a 192-gram reduction in infant birthweight, and a 6.1-day reduction in gestational age at birth.

"Coping strategies moderate the effect of perceived stress on sleep and health in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Stress in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic may have a significant impact on health, including sleep health. Older adults may be particularly vulnerable. This study examined associations between perceived stress and sleep health, mental health, physical health, and overall perceived health outcomes among older adults. We also examined whether specific coping strategies moderate these associations. Older adults (n = 115; M<sub>age</sub> = 68.62) reported perceived stress, coping strategies, global sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and perceived mental, physical, and overall health before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress-health relationships were modeled with hierarchical linear regression. Higher perceived stress was associated with greater depressive symptoms and poorer mental health concurrently and longitudinally. Coping strategies moderated the association of perceived stress with physical health and overall perceived health. For example, higher perceived stress was associated with poorer overall perceived health among those with lower problem-focused coping, but not among those with higher problem-focused coping. Older adults may benefit from prevention and intervention strategies targeting stress management. Furthermore, identifying people with low problem-focused coping might be a useful strategy to prevent worsening health in future public health crises. This article is protected by copyright.

Such reminders could have negative mental health impacts, especially among psychologically vulnerable people, including those with trauma-related problems. We experimentally examined the effects of pandemic reminders among trauma-exposed participants sampled from Prolific (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°238). Participants were induced to think about health-related or social isolation-related aspects of COVID-19 or their favourite TV show and existential anxiety and coping self-efficacy (CSE) were then assessed. Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) related to a prior stressor and COVID-related functional impairment were assessed as potential moderators of reactions to pandemic reminders. Results showed that both types of pandemic reminders lowered CSE among participants with either higher PTSS or COVID-related functional impairment. Pandemic reminders did not significantly affect existential anxiety. These findings suggest that reminders of the COVID-19 pandemic may undermine the mental health of psychologically vulnerable populations.","Lockett, Pyszczynski, Koole","https://doi.org/10.1080/02699931.2021.2020731","20211224","Trauma; coping self-efficacy; existential anxiety; large-scale crises; pandemics","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24384,""

"Biomedical Perspectives of Acute and Chronic Neurological and Neuropsychiatric Sequelae of COVID-19","The incidence of infections from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has dramatically escalated following the initial outbreak in China in late 2019, resulting in a global pandemic with millions of deaths. Although the majority of infected patients survive, and the rapid advent and deployment of vaccines have afforded increased immunity against SARS-CoV-2, long term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have become increasingly recognized. These include, but are not limited to, chronic pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disorders, and proinflammatory-associated neurological dysfunction that may lead to psychological and neurocognitive impairment. A major component of cognitive dysfunction is operationally categorized as ""brain fog"" which comprises difficulty with concentration, forgetfulness, confusion, depression, and fatigue. Multiple parameters associated with long-term neuropsychiatric sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection have been detailed in clinical studies. Empirically elucidated mechanisms associated with the neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are by nature complex, but broad based working models have focused on mitochondrial dysregulation leading to systemic reductions of metabolic activity and cellular bioenergetics within CNS structures. Multiple factors underlying the expression of brain fog may facilitate future pathogenic insults leading to repetitive cycles of viral and bacterial propagation. Interestingly, diverse neurocognitive sequelae associated with COVID-19 are not dissimilar from those observed in other historical pandemics, thereby providing a broad and integrative perspective on potential common mechanisms of CNS dysfunction subsequent to viral infection. Poor mental health status may be reciprocally linked to compromised immune processes and enhanced susceptibility to infection by diverse pathogens. By extrapolation, we contend that COVID-19 may potentiate the severity of neurological/neurocognitive deficits in patients afflicted by well-studied neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Accordingly, the prevention, diagnosis, and management of sustained neuropsychiatric manifestations of COVID-19 are pivotal health care directives and provide a compelling rationale for careful monitoring of infected patients, as early mitigation efforts may reduce short- and long-term complications.","Stefano, BÃƒÂ¼ttiker, Weissenberger, Ptacek, Wang, Esch, Bilfinger, Kream","https://doi.org/10.2174/1570159X20666211223130228","20211224","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; brain fog; central nervous system; cognitive impairment; depression; long COVID; microglia; mitochondria; neuroinflammation; neuropsychiatric disease","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24386,""
"A homeschool-based cognitive behavioral program to improve adolescent mental health","Anxiety and depression are prevalent in the adolescent population and can have significant consequences.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the number of homeschooled children and compounded the problem of adolescent mental health disorders. This pilot evidence-based practice project aimed to increase access to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in adolescents. Eight students from a local homeschool cooperative participated in the Creating Opportunities for Personal Empowerment (COPE) program. A Friedman test was used to evaluate median differences on anxiety and depression screening instruments at baseline, program completion, and 1 month after the program. Students also completed an adapted COPE program evaluation. Median scores on screening instruments decreased from pre-COPE to 1 month after, although results were not statistically significant. Students reported that the COPE program was helpful, and they learned new ways to deal with their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. COPE is a feasible option to increase access to CBT in a homeschool setting.","Harper, Brewer","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcap.12364","20211224","adolescent; cognitive behavioral therapy; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24387,""
"The Influence of COVID-19 Stress and Self-Concealment on Professional Help-Seeking Attitudes: A Cross-Sectional Study of University Students","The fourth wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically influenced many aspects of individuals' lives, putting the general population's mental health at high risk, especially university students in Vietnam. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between current living status and COVID-19 stress and test whether COVID-19 stress mediates the effect of self-concealment on help-seeking attitudes among university students. A sample of 478 university students was recruited online to complete the survey. Parametric tests, correlation, regression, and simple mediation analyses were used to analyze the data. Our results show that students living alone experience more COVID-19 stress levels than those living with family or friends. Additionally, there is a significant positive association between self-concealment and professional help-seeking attitudes that is partially mediated by COVID-19 stress. Individuals who tend to conceal personal information have high COVID-19 stress levels, leading to positive professional help-seeking attitudes. University administrators, social workers, counselors, clinicians, and therapists must consider students living alone as prioritized vulnerable groups for early mental health interventions. Clinicians should be aware of self-concealment and professional help-seeking attitudes that could influence psychological treatment.","Tran-Chi, Ly, Luu-Thi, Huynh, Nguyen-Thi","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S345244","20211225","COVID-19 stress; current living status; professional help-seeking attitudes; self-concealment; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24388,""
"Stressors, self-reported overall health, potential protective factors and the workplace well-being of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland: a longitudinal mixed-methods study protocol","The COVID-19 pandemic was making a huge impact on Europe's healthcare systems in the spring of 2020, and most predictive models concurred that pandemic waves were in the offing. Most studies adopted a pathogenic approach to the subject; few used a salutogenic approach. These showed, however, that nurses can retain their health despite a pandemic by mobilising generalised resistance resources. Our study aims to understand how nurses working in Switzerland's hospitals protected their health and workplace well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic by investigating the moderating effects of the health resources they mobilised against the stressors inherent to the situation. The study aims to explore and describe the stressors and the resources nurses used to remain healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. We will use a concurrent mixed-methods panel design with qualitative analyses ancillary to quantitative analyses. Quantitative data will be collected using electronic questionnaires at four time points over 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°years. Qualitative data will be collected using focus groups. Nurses from Switzerland's two main linguistic regions who had direct, indirect or no contact with patients with COVID-19 will be invited to participate. The a priori sample size will be at least 3631 participants at T0 and 1852 at T4. Longitudinal structural equation modelling and knowledge mapping will be used to analyse quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The results derived from the two data types will then be compared and discussed using a side-by-side approach to determine whether they agree or disagree and how they complement each other to achieve our aims. Nurses will receive an electronic informed consent form. The data collected will be stored on a secure server at the authors' institution.

"COVID-19 Vaccination Rates and Attitudes Among Young Adults With Recent Experiences of Homelessness","This study provides information on COVID-19 vaccination and attitudes among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness. Participants (nÃ‚Â = 134) from a clinical trial of a risk reduction program for youth experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles completed survey items about COVID-19 vaccinations between March and OctoberÃ‚Â 2021. A total of 29% of respondents were vaccinated, and 50% were not interested in getting vaccinated. Among the unvaccinated, 58% had not been offered the vaccine; furthermore, 38%-45% had strong distrust of the vaccine and were worried about its harmfulness. Vaccination status was generally unrelated to demographics, housing instability, service use, substance use, or mental health. Our data suggest that vaccination rates are lower among young adults with recent experiences of homelessness than those in the general US population. The results suggest a need for greater direct outreach that includes both offering the vaccine and addressing misconceptions about its safety to increase vaccination rates in this population.","Tucker, D'Amico, Pedersen, Garvey, Rodriguez, Klein","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.11.017","20211224","COVID-19; Homelessness; Vaccination; Young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24390,""

"COVID-19 and HIV among children and adolescents: Current inequalities","The HIV epidemic enters its fifth decade amid a global pandemic. The increasing poverty, mental health problems, and abuse are raising the risk of infection for children, adolescents, and women. The inequalities driving the HIV epidemic, which are now exacerbated by COVID-19, demonstrate the social and clinical inequalities of more children infected with HIV and more children losing their fight against AIDS. In this context, current evidence highlights that, alarmingly, two out of five children living with HIV worldwide are unaware of their status, and just over half of children with HIV are receiving antiretroviral treatment. Discrimination and gender inequalities permeate significant situations in HIV services due to COVID-19 in early 2020 and throughout 2021. It was observed in recent studies substantial reductions in births in health facilities, maternal HIV testing, and initiation of antiretroviral treatment for HIV. An AIDS-free generation should be possible, but we are not there yet.

"Experiencing the Unprecedented COVID-19 Lockdown: Abu Dhabi Older Adults' Challenges and Concerns","This study focused on older adults (60+ years old) of both genders in Abu Dhabi during the COVID-19 pandemic before vaccines were made available (age ranged from 60 years to 75 years). They faced more strict rules of movement restriction and isolation that might have resulted in certain psychological feelings and social reactions. The main objective was to understand Abu Dhabi older adults' psychological feelings during the pandemic and to identify their main concerns and challenges considering the various COVID-19-related policies and restrictions. The psychological feelings focused on fear, loneliness, sadness, irritability, emotional exhaustion, depressive symptoms, sleeping disorders, overeating, and excessive screen use. The objectives also included the changes in the psychological feelings concerning time. Other objectives covered better understanding the differences in (some activities) compared to the other age categories. Data were gathered through an online survey of community members from February to July 2020 as part of government initiatives (Department of Community Development). Responses were collected from 574 older adults in Abu Dhabi (60.1% male and 39.9% female). The analysis mainly used descriptive analysis, <i>t</i>-tests, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and simple trend analysis. For all tests, a <i>p</i>-value less than 0.05 was used for significance. The results pointed to the significant rise in feelings related to excessive screen use, fear, loneliness, and stress. The most significant concerns were related to more restrictions being imposed and not being able to see the grandchildren.The impact of new technologies on their quality of life was significantly reflected by respondents. The influence of the pandemic on older adults' health and weight was also investigated. Analysis of variance, <i>t</i>-tests, and regression analysis with relevant tests were employed. The relevant results showed that some negative psychological feelings were common among older adults during the pandemic. However, the psychological feelings did not portray significant changes with time, except for sleeping disorders and overeating. Overall, older adults scored significantly different from other age groups on many challenges, concerns, and views regarding new technologies during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed regarding gender and marital status for the challenges and concerns. The research summarizes some policy guidance while noting some limitations of this study and future research directions.","Badri, Alkhaili, Aldhaheri, Yang, Albahar, Alrashdi, Almulla, Alhyas","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413427","20211224","Abu Dhabi; COVID-19; older adults; social isolation; technological challenges","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24393,""
"Association between Children's Engagement in Community Cultural Activities and Their Mental Health during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results from A-CHILD Study","Social learning experiences developed through engagement in community cultural activities can affect a child's development. Few studies have examined how children's engagement in community activities is related to their mental health.

We targeted all sixth-grade children in all 69 primary schools in Adachi City, Tokyo, using the Adachi Child Health Impact of Living Difficulty (A-CHILD) study (<i>n</i> = 4391). Parents answered the validated Japanese version of the Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) to assess child mental health, the child's engagement in community cultural activities. The community activity in which children most frequently participated was local festivals. Participating in local festivals was significantly associated with lower behavioral difficulties (ÃŽÂ² = -0.49, SE = 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.005) and higher prosocial behaviors (ÃŽÂ² = 0.25, SE = 0.07, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) after adjusting for demographic variables, family social capital, and parent-child interactions.

"The Effects of Physical Exercise on Mental Health: From Cognitive Improvements to Risk of Addiction","(1) <i>Background</i>: we aimed to investigate the effects of physical activity on cognitive functions and deficits of healthy population and other needy groups. Secondly, we investigated the relation between healthy habits and psychopathological risks. Finally, we investigated the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on exercise addiction and possible associated disorders. (2) <i>Methods</i>: From April 2021 to October 2021, we conducted a review aimed at identifying the effects of physical exercise on mental health, from cognitive improvements to risk of addiction; we searched for relevant studies on PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CINHAL. (3) <i>Results</i>: For the first purpose, results indicated multiple effects such as better precision and response speed in information processing tasks on healthy populations; improvement of executive functions, cognitive flexibility and school performance in children; improvement of attention and executive functions and less hyperactivity and impulsiveness on children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); improvement of executive and global functions on adults; improvement of overall cognitive functioning on patients with schizophrenic spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder. Data also demonstrated that exercise addiction seems to be related to low levels of education, low self-esteem, eating disorders and body dysmorphisms. Eventually, it was found that people with lower traits and intolerance of uncertainty show a strong association between COVID-19 anxiety and compulsive exercise and eating disorder.

"The Sustained Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Health Care Workers One Year after the Outbreak-A Repeated Cross-Sectional Survey in a Tertiary Hospital of North-East Italy","This study aimed to evaluate the mental health outcomes of health care workers (HCWs) of the Verona academic hospital trust (Italy) one year after the outbreak of COVID-19 and to identify predicted risk factors. A web-based survey was conducted from mid-April to mid-May 2021 on hospital workers one year after the first evaluation performed during the lock-down phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-traumatic stress, general anxiety, depression, and burnout were assessed by using, respectively, the impact of event scale (IES-R), the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS), the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Maslach burnout inventory-general survey (MBI-GS). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with each of the four mental health outcomes one year after the COVID-19 outbreak.

There was also an increase when stratifying by occupation and workplace, with a greater increase for depression and burnout. Multivariate analysis revealed that, one year after the COVID-19 outbreak, nurses were at the greatest risk of anxiety and depression, whereas residents were at the greatest risk of burnout (in terms of low professional efficacy).

"Moral Distress Trajectories of Physicians 1 Year after the COVID-19 Outbreak: A Grounded Theory Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has confronted emergency and critical care physicians with unprecedented ethically challenging situations. The aim of this paper was to explore physicians' experience of moral distress during the pandemic. A qualitative multicenter study was conducted using grounded theory. We recruited 15 emergency and critical care physicians who worked in six hospitals from the Lombardy region of Italy. Semi-structured interviews about their professional experience of moral distress were conducted from November 2020-February 2021 (1 year after the pandemic outbreak). The transcripts were qualitatively analyzed following open, axial, and selective coding. A model of moral distress was generated around the core category of Being a Good Doctor. Several Pandemic Stressors threatened the sense of Being a Good Doctor, causing moral distress. Pandemic Stressors included limited healthcare resources, intensified patient triage, changeable selection criteria, limited therapeutic/clinical knowledge, and patient isolation. Emotions of Moral Distress included powerlessness, frustration/anger, and sadness. Physicians presented different Individual Responses to cope with moral distress, such as avoidance, acquiescence, reinterpretation, and resistance. These Individual Responses generated different Moral Outcomes, such as moral residue, disengagement, or moral integrity. The Working Environment, especially the team and organizational culture, was instrumental in restoring or disrupting moral integrity. In order for physicians to manage moral distress successfully, it was important to use reinterpretation, that is, to find new ways of enacting their own values by reframing morally distressing situations, and to perceive a cooperative and supportive Working Environment.","Lamiani, Biscardi, Meyer, Giannini, Vegni","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413367","20211224","COVID-19; emergency medicine; ethics; grounded theory; intensive care; moral distress; psychological stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24397,""
"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Students, Assistants, and Faculty of a Dental Institute of Saudi Arabia","This study aimed to assess the perceived stress levels in students, assistants, and faculty members of the College of Dentistry, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal, University (IAU), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using the Cohen's perceived stress scale (PSS) questionnaire (consisting of 14 items, hence called PSS-14), an online observational survey was conducted. The PSS 14 was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (very often). The scores ranging from 0-18 represented low stress, 19-37 represented moderate stress, and 38-56 represented high stress. The second-and third-year students were designated as junior year students, while fourth-year onwards were considered senior year students. Out of total 265 participants, 65% (173) were female, and the majority of the participants were dental students 70% (185) with a mean age of 26.71 Ã‚Â± 9.26 years. In the present study, the average PSS score for the participants was computed as 29.89 (range score: 0-56) which shows moderate stress levels among the respondents. The PSS score for the students was 31.03; for the faculty, it was 28, while for the assistants, it was 27.05. Among the three participant groups, the students were found more on the severe stress side (19%) (<i>p</i>-value = 0.002), and among them, the senior year students (6th year) showed significantly higher stress levels compared to the junior year students (<i>p</i>-value = 0.005). Age-wise, the participants below 20 years were most stressed (21%), followed by those 20-30 years old (18%). Female participants were more severely stressed than males (17% vs. 10%, respectively). It was concluded that the students experienced more stress, followed by the faculty members and dental assistants. In addition, younger participants, females, and senior year students were more stressed than their counterparts. Future studies directed at evaluating stress levels of these groups from different dental institutes could provide an opportunity for policymakers to offer various resources to improve their mental health.","Ali, Tauqir, Farooqi, Al-Jandan, Al-Janobi, Alshehry, Abdelhady, Farooq","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413366","20211224","COVID-19; dentistry; psychology; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24398,""
"Positive Psychology in Times of Pandemic-Time Perspective as a Moderator of the Relationship between Resilience and Meaning in Life","Resilience and meaning in life are significant indicators of psychological well-being and health, which are particularly important in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, they have been explored by a growing number of scientists. There has been a research gap, however, that fails to show that time perspectives also have a significant impact on the perception and building of different life aspects. The current study investigated the associations between resilience, time perspectives and meaning in life and examined the moderating role of time perspective in the relationship between resilience and meaning in life. Participants of this cross-sectional study were 363 adults aged 18-70. Resilience Measurement Scale (SPP-25), the Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory (ZTPI), and the Purpose in Life Questionnaire (PIL) were used. The findings confirmed a positive relationship between resilience, meaning in life, and positive time perspectives (Present Hedonistic and Future) and a negative link with Past Negative and Present Fatalistic perspectives. The linear regression analyses showed that Past Negative and Past Positive perspectives significantly moderated the relationship between resilience and meaning in life. The moderating effect was also confirmed in the case of past time perspectives only. The findings indicate the relevance of positive resources, such as resilience and positive perception of the past, in keeping the meaning in life. Understanding the effect of psychological strengths in the context of the pandemic time can be a key to providing intervention and therapeutic services fostering mental health and well-being.","Lasota, MrÃƒÂ³z","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413340","20211224","MIL; meaning in life; resilience; time perspectives","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24399,""
"Alcohol Use and Its Related Psychosocial Effects during the Prolonged COVID-19 Pandemic in Japan: A Cross-Sectional Survey","We conducted a large-scale survey in the Japanese population, about one year after the initial declaration of the state of emergency, to investigate alcohol use under the prolonged coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and its related psychosocial and demographic characteristics. The survey was conducted online between 15 and 20 June 2021. A total of 11,427 participants were included in the analysis (48.5% female, 48.82 Ã‚Â± 13.30 years, range = 20-90 years). Compared with females, males were more prevalent in the hazardous user and the potential alcoholism group and were less prevalent in the no alcohol-related problem group. However, the prevalence of potential alcoholism among the participants in our study was higher than that previously reported. This trend was particularly pronounced in women. The presence of potential alcoholism was related to a deteriorated psychological status, particularly depression and anxiety, and various difficulties in their daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the future, intervention methods and systems should be developed to provide optimal assistance to people with psychological problems who are vulnerable to alcohol-related problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, while conducting further long-term follow-up studies.","Sugaya, Yamamoto, Suzuki, Uchiumi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph182413318","20211224","alcohol use; mental health; the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; the coronavirus disease 2019","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24400,""
"Modulatory Effects of Physical Activity Levels on Immune Responses and General Clinical Functions in Adult Patients with Mild to Moderate SARS-CoV-2 Infections-A Protocol for an Observational Prospective Follow-Up Investigation: Fit-COVID-19 Study","<b>Background:</b> This proposal aims to explain some of the gaps in scientific knowledge on the natural history of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), with a specific focus on immune, inflammatory, and metabolic markers, in parallel with temporal assessment of clinical and mental health in patients with COVID-19. The study will explore the temporal modulatory effects of physical activity and body composition on individual trajectories. This approach will provide a better understanding of the survival mechanisms provided by the immunomodulatory role of physical fitness. <b>Methods:</b> We will conduct a prospective observational cohort study including adult patients previously infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus who have expressed a mild to moderate COVID-19 infection. Procedures will be conducted for all participants at baseline, six weeks after vaccination, and again at 12 months. At each visit, a venous blood sample will be collected for immune phenotypic characterization and biochemistry assays (inflammatory and metabolic parameters). Also, body composition, physical activity level, cardiovascular and pulmonary function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, functional exercise capacity, and mental health will be evaluated. Using the baseline information, participants will be grouped based on physical activity levels (sedentary versus active), body composition (normal weight versus overweight or obese), and SARS-CoV-2 status (positive versus negative). A sub-study will provide mechanistic evidence using an in-vitro assay based on well-trained individuals and age-matched sedentary controls who are negative for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whole blood will be stimulated using recombinant human coronavirus to determine the cytokine profile. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy well-trained participants will be collected and treated with homologous serum (from the main study; samples collected before and after the vaccine) and recombinant coronavirus (inactive virus). The metabolism of PBMCs will be analyzed using Respirometry (Seahorse). Data will be analyzed using multilevel repeated-measures ANOVA. <b>Conclusions:</b> The data generated will help us answer three main questions: (1) Does the innate immune system of physically active individuals respond better to viral infections compared with that of sedentary people? (2) which functional and metabolic mechanisms explain the differences in responses in participants with different physical fitness levels? and (3) do these mechanisms have long-term positive modulatory effects on mental and cardiovascular health?

"Innate Immunity as an Executor of the Programmed Death of Individual Organisms for the Benefit of the Entire Population","In humans, over-activation of innate immunity in response to viral or bacterial infections often causes severe illness and death. Furthermore, similar mechanisms related to innate immunity can cause pathogenesis and death in sepsis, massive trauma (including surgery and burns), ischemia/reperfusion, some toxic lesions, and viral infections including COVID-19. Based on the reviewed observations, we suggest that such severe outcomes may be manifestations of a controlled suicidal strategy protecting the entire population from the spread of pathogens and from dangerous pathologies rather than an aberrant hyperstimulation of defense responses. We argue that innate immunity may be involved in the implementation of an altruistic programmed death of an organism aimed at increasing the well-being of the whole community. We discuss possible ways to suppress this atavistic program by interfering with innate immunity and suggest that combating this program should be a major goal of future medicine.","Chernyak, Lyamzaev, Mulkidjanian","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222413480","20211224","COVID-19; damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs); inflammasome; inflammation; mitochondrially-targeted antioxidants; pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs); phenoptosis; programmed death","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24402,""
"Polyethylene Films Containing Plant Extracts in the Polymer Matrix as Antibacterial and Antiviral Materials","Low density polyethylene (LDPE) films covered with active coatings containing mixtures of rosemary, raspberry, and pomegranate CO<sub>2</sub> extracts were found to be active against selected bacterial strains that may extend the shelf life of food products. The coatings also offer antiviral activity, due to their influence on the activity of ÃŽÂ¦6 bacteriophage, selected as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 particles. The mixture of these extracts could be incorporated into a polymer matrix to obtain a foil with antibacterial and antiviral properties. The initial goal of this work was to obtain active LDPE films containing a mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> extracts of the aforementioned plants, incorporated into an LDPE matrix via an extrusion process. The second aim of this study was to demonstrate the antibacterial properties of the active films against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and to determine the antiviral effect of the modified material on ÃŽÂ¦6 bacteriophage. In addition, an analysis was made on the influence of the active mixture on the polymer physicochemical features, e.g., mechanical and thermal properties, as well as its color and transparency. The results of this research indicated that the LDPE film containing a mixture of raspberry, rosemary, and pomegranate CO<sub>2</sub> extracts incorporated into an LDPE matrix inhibited the growth of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. This film was also found to be active against <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>. This modified film did not inhibit the growth of <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i> cells; however, their number decreased significantly. The LDPE active film was also found to be active against ÃŽÂ¦6 particles, meaning that the film had antiviral properties. The incorporation of the mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> extracts into the polymer matrix affected its mechanical properties. It was observed that parameters describing mechanical properties decreased, although did not affect the transition of LDPE significantly. Additionally, the modified film exhibited barrier properties towards UV radiation. Modified PE/CO<sub>2</sub> extracts films could be applied as a functional food packaging material with antibacterial and antiviral properties.","Ordon, Zdanowicz, Nawrotek, Stachurska, MizieliÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms222413438","20211224","CO2 extracts; PE films; SARS-Co-V2; active films; active foils; antibacterial properties; antiviral properties; plant extracts; pomegranate seeds; raspberry seeds; rosemary; ÃŽÂ¦6 phage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24403,""
"Confinement by COVID-19 and Degree of Mental Health of a Sample of Students of Health Sciences","In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, most countries have taken important measures to control the spread of the virus, such as population confinement and the closure of universities. The main objective of this study is to evaluate how the situation resulting from COVID-19 has affected the mental health of a group of health sciences students. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study with a sample of 160 people, conducted through an online survey of final-year students of dentistry, nursing and medicine at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the University of Barcelona. A total of 82.4% of students reported having suffered stress, anxiety and distress due to the pandemic situation, and 83.10% of participants are worried about not knowing when the academic year will restart.

"To Work or Not to Work, That Is the Question: The Psychological Impact of the First COVID-19 Lockdown on the Elderly, Healthcare Workers, and Virtual Workers","The spread of COVID-19 created a state of emergency all over the world and played a big role in the decline of the mental health of citizens. The context of the workplace became an important variable in the impact of the lockdown on individuals. In this study, we deepened the categories of healthcare workers (HWs), virtual workers (VWs), and the elderly, along with their emotional approach to this emergency. A sample of 257 participants (ElderlyN = 62; HWsN = 104; VWsN = 91) completed: a semi-structured interview on their experience during lockdown via telephone; an online survey with a sociodemographic questionnaire; the Difficulties in Emotional Regulation Scale (DERS); and the Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI). Linguistic measures of the Referential Process were utilized to code the interviews. An independent ANOVA explored the variability among groups. The results show more affective language in the Elderly (M = 0.0310, SD = 0.0070) and a growth in spirituality (M = 4.16, SD = 3.17). HWs displayed a higher PTGI (M = 56.84, SD = 20.29), while VWs displayed a lower PTGI (M = 50.02, SD = 21.05). Moreover, VWs presented higher scores in Impulse on the DERS (M = 11.67, SD = 5.05) and a more cognitive/abstract narration (Reflection IREF M = 0.0260, SD = 0.0071; Reorganization IWRRL M = 0.5419, SD = 0.0032; Referential Activity IWRAD M = 0.4978, SD = 0.0029).

"Challenges and Innovations Brought about by the COVID-19 Pandemic Regarding Medical and Pharmacy Education Especially in Africa and Implications for the Future","Multiple measures introduced early to restrict COVID-19 have dramatically impacted the teaching of medical and pharmacy students, exacerbated by the lack of infrastructure and experience with e-learning at the start of the pandemic. In addition, the costs and reliability of the Internet across Africa pose challenges alongside undertaking clinical teaching and practical programmes. Consequently, there is a need to understand the many challenges and how these were addressed, given increasingly complex patients, to provide future direction. An exploratory study was conducted among senior-level medical and pharmacy educators across Africa, addressing four key questions, including the challenges resulting from the pandemic and how these were dealt with. Staff and student members faced multiple challenges initially, including adapting to online learning. In addition, concerns with the lack of equipment (especially among disadvantaged students), the costs of Internet bundles, and how to conduct practicals and clinical teaching. Multiple activities were undertaken to address these challenges. These included training sessions, developing innovative approaches to teaching, and seeking ways to reduce Internet costs. Robust approaches to practicals, clinical teaching, and assessments have been developed. Appreciable difficulties to teaching arising from the pandemic are being addressed across Africa. Research is ongoing to improve education and assessments.","Etando, Amu, Haque, Schellack, Kurdi, Alrasheedy, Timoney, Mwita, Rwegerera, Patrick, Niba, Boahen-Boaten, Tabi, Amu, Acolatse, Incoom, Sefah, Guantai, Opanga, Chikowe, Khuluza, Kibuule, Kalemeera, Hango, Lates, Fadare, Ogunleye, Saleem, Oosthuizen, Cordier, Matlala, Meyer, Schellack, Massele, Malande, Kalungia, Sichone, Banda, Zaranyika, Campbell, Godman","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9121722","20211224","Africa; COVID-19; Internet platforms; cross country learning; e-learning; hybrid approaches; medical education; mental health; pharmacy education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24406,""
"Associated Factors with Perceived Fear of COVID-19 among Vietnamese Hospital Healthcare Workers during Fourth Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Policy Implications for Interconnected and Social- and Personal-Based Health Support","(1) Background: The present study measures the fear of COVID-19 among hospital healthcare workers and identifies several factors associated with increasing fear of COVID-19. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional, hospital-based survey was conducted on healthcare workforce recruited from the National Hospital of Tropical Diseases from 1 October 2021 and 20 October 2021. We selected the participants who have been directly involved in diagnosing, treating, or providing nursing care to patients with COVID-19. The primary data was collected via sending the invitation directly to the participants, utilizing structured self-completed questionnaires. The seven-item fear of COVID-19 scale was used to measure the data. The responses of 208 hospital healthcare workers were included in the final analysis. (3) Results: Total score of COVID-19 fear was 19.62 (SD = 5.22). The COVID-19 fear score of 7 items ranged from 2.38 (SD = 0.83) to 3.21 (SD = 0.96). The lowest and highest scores were the item '<i>My hands become clammy when I think about Corona</i>' and the item '<i>I am most afraid of corona</i>' was the highest, respectively. Linear regression of the COVID-19 fear showed that the factors positively correlated with the fear of COVID-19 among hospital healthcare workers were: being influenced by the community (<i>p</i> = 0.001), feeling at very high risk of COVID-19 (<i>p</i> = 0.03), and experiencing traumatic stress with an academic event (<i>p</i> = 0.042). (4) Conclusions: Although these findings merit further elaboration, these preliminary findings suggest relatively great fear of the COVID-19 pandemic among Vietnamese hospital healthcare workers and that social and personal connections are necessary for maintaining the mental wellbeing.","Doan, Tran, Than, Nguyen, Bui, Nguyen, Vo, Do, Pham, Nguyen, Cao, Nguyen, Tran, Pham, Tran, Nguyen, Nguyen, Tran, Nguyen, Lai, Vu, Otsu","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9121713","20211224","COVID-19; fear; mental health; psychophysiology; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24407,""
"Mental Health and Associated Demographic and Occupational Factors among Health Care Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Latvia","<i>Background and Objectives:</i> The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the health care system. Front-line health care workers (HCWs) are at a higher risk of mental health adverse outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of the symptoms of depression and anxiety and associated demographic and occupational factors among front-line HCWs in Latvia. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> A cross-sectional quantitative study was performed in a population of HCWs during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Latvia. The participants were interviewed between 28 April 2020 and 2 June 2020. Answers from 864 HCWs were obtained. The participants reported their demographics, work-related information, contacts with COVID-19-positive patients and completed two standardised questionnaires that assessed the symptoms of anxiety (GAD-7) and depression (PHQ-9). The gathered data were analysed by a chi-squared test and binary logistic regression. The data analysis was performed using SPSS v25. <i>Results:</i> A total of 209 (24.8%) participants had depression symptoms and 145 (17.2%) had anxiety symptoms. Health care workers older than 50 had a lower risk of both depression (OR 0.422 (95% CI, 0.262-0.680)) and anxiety (OR 0.468 (95% CI, 0.270-0.813)). General practitioners had more frequent symptoms of depression and anxiety than participants who worked at hospitals (32.8% (<i>n</i> = 63) versus 19.4% (<i>n</i> = 73) and 27.1% (<i>n</i> = 52) versus 10.3% (<i>n</i> = 39), respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.037; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.000)).

This systematic review was based on PRISMA guidelines. A bibliographic search was conducted using BNE, BVS (LILAC), CSIC (IME, ISOC), IBECS, Scielo, Scopus, Medline, and PubMed, using the following search profile: (COVID-19 or 2019-NCOV or SARS-CoV-2 or COV-19) AND asthma AND (children or adolescents or youths or children or teenagers). The results were limited to those articles published between December 2019 and December 2020, selecting only articles published in Spanish, English and French that included the study population (children aged 0-18 years). Among the 1066 results of the bibliographic search and seven articles selected from a manual search, only 19 articles were found to fit our eligibility criteria. Most of the articles highlight the effects of lockdown on the paediatric asthma population, increased therapeutic compliance, and the role of inhaled corticosteroids and intrinsic factors such as ACE2 receptors as causes of the decreased prevalence of COVID-19 among the paediatric asthma population. This population has unique characteristics that serve as protective factors against COVID-19.

"How COVID-19 Has Affected Caregivers' Burden of Patients with Dementia: An Exploratory Study Focusing on Coping Strategies and Quality of Life during the Lockdown","COVID-19 has caused a public and international health emergency, leading to isolation and social distancing. These restrictions have had a significant impact on the caregivers of people with dementia, increasing the burden of patient management. The purpose of this study was to investigate the stress perceived by caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) during the pandemic. We used a cross-sectional survey design to evaluate the caregivers' psychological responses and coping strategies. Eighty-four caregivers of patients with a diagnosis of AD were involved in this study by completing an online questionnaire. They presented a high perception of stress (the Perceived Stress Scale mean Ã‚Â± DS: 33.5 Ã‚Â± 4.5), and their high burden in caring was mainly related to physical difficulties (Caregiver Burden Inventory-Physical Burden mean Ã‚Â± DS: 15.0 Ã‚Â± 2.1) and perception of loss of time (Caregiver Burden Inventory-Time-dependence Burden mean Ã‚Â± DS: 16.5 Ã‚Â± 1.4). Moreover, caregivers perceived their quality of life as very low (Short Form-12 Health Survey Physical mean Ã‚Â± DS: 13.5 Ã‚Â± 2.7; Short Form-12 Health Survey Mental Health mean Ã‚Â± DS: 16.4 Ã‚Â± 4.2). Finally, we found that participants mostly used dysfunctional coping strategies, such as avoidance strategies (Coping Orientation to Problem Experiences-Avoidance Strategies mean Ã‚Â± DS: 39.5 Ã‚Â± 7.1), but these strategies did not affect the stress level of caregivers. Given that caregivers present a high burden and stress, innovative tools could be a valuable solution to investigate and support their emotional and behavioral status during difficult periods, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Maggio, La Rosa, Calatozzo, Andaloro, Foti Cuzzola, CannavÃƒÂ², Militi, Manuli, Oddo, Pioggia, CalabrÃƒÂ²","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10245953","20211224","AlzheimerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease; burden; caregiver; dementia; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-28","",24411,""

Overall reported alcohol consumption decreased but increased in those reporting drinking more than once a week. Those reporting starting smoking during the pandemic were found to have higher SAS and PSS scores. Those reporting being online for 3 or more hours were found to have higher ISS scores. Doctors who reported playing video games were found to have higher PSS, ISS and SAS scores whilst nurses who reported playing video games were found to have higher ISS scores. Doctors who reported playing for longer than one hour had higher PSS scores. Online behaviours may be a coping behaviour of HCPs affected by the pandemic.
