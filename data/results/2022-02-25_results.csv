"Association of Workload and Practice of Respectful Maternity Care Among the Healthcare Providers, Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic in South Western Nepal: A Cross-Sectional Study","Introduction: Respectful maternity care is a crucial component of intrapartum quality care. As the imbalance in demand and supply of the maternity care workforce affects intrapartum quality care, respectful maternity care might be affected by increased workload among the healthcare providers. Thus, this study was conducted to examine the association between workload among healthcare providers and their practice of respectful maternity care, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in South Western Nepal. A total of 78 birthing centers and 267 healthcare providers were included. Data collection was done through telephone interviews. The exposure variable was workload among the healthcare providers, and the outcome variable was respectful maternity care practice before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Multilevel mixed-effect linear regression was used to examine the association. Results: The median client-provider ratio before and during the pandemic was 21.7 and 13.0, respectively. The mean score of respectful maternity care practice was 44.5 (SD 3.8) before the pandemic, which was decreased to 43.6 (SD 4.5) during the pandemic. Client-provider ratio was negatively associated with respectful maternity care practice for both times; before (Coef. -5.16; 95% CI -8.41 to -1.91) and during (Coef. -7.47; 95% CI -12.72 to -2.23) the pandemic. The variance of respectful maternity care practice among the health facilities was 26% before the pandemic, and was increased to 33% during the pandemic. Being tested positive for COVID-19 in the past was negatively associated with respectful maternity care practice during the COVID-19 pandemic (Coef. -3.18; 95% CI -5.06 to -1.30). Conclusions: While a higher client-provider ratio was associated with a lower respectful maternity care practice score both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, the coefficient was larger during the pandemic. Also, the variance among the health facilities for respectful maternity care was increased more during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study call for the decrement in the client-provider ratio for better respectful maternity care practice, especially during the pandemic. However, supplying health human resources per the population demand, especially during the pandemic, may be difficult in a resource-limited setting. The number of delivery cases at local health facilities should be increased by improving the quality of care, particularly during the pandemic. This could help equal distribution of client-provider and practice respectful maternity care, even during the pandemic. Further, healthcare providers who tested positive for COVID-19 had lower respectful maternity care practice scores. Therefore, additional physical and mental health support to healthcare providers should be considered to improve their respectful maternity care practice, particularly during the pandemic.","Alpha Pokharel; Junko Kiriya; Akira Shibanuma; Ram Silwal; Masamine Jimba","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.21.22271309","20220224","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27490,""
"Effect of perception of stage in time course of the pandemic on the emotional health of ICU workers","INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: Recent studies have shown that healthcare workers directly engaged with COVID-19 patients and those with pre-existing psychological problems were at increased risk of anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms. It is not known whether these symptoms are anticipatory or reactive. This study examines the influence that the perception of the course in time of the pandemic (early, middle, late) has on ICU professionals' mental health. We hypothesize that those workers who perceive that they were at the beginning of the pandemic would have higher anticipatory anxiety, but those who perceived they were toward the end would have higher reactive depression and somatization symptoms. METHODS: On April 7, 2020, an email survey was sent to the members of SCCM with a reminder email one week later to those who hadn't yet responded. Collected information included demographic data, perception of caseload and point in the time course of the pandemic, and responses to psychological instruments assessing depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), and symptom somatization (PHQ-15). RESULTS: ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc analysis of the 939 responses showed no significant difference between respondent's perception of their stage in the time course of the pandemic (early, middle, toward the end) and levels of depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7);however, those who believed they were near the end of the pandemic had significantly fewer somatic symptoms (PHQ-15) than those who believed they were early or mid (p&lt; 0.05). DISCUSSION: Perception of stage in the time course of the pandemic did not influence the presence of depression or anxiety but did lead to improved somatization symptoms for those who felt they were at the end of the pandemic. These results suggest that reactive depression and anxiety abate more slowly than somatic symptoms during a pandemic. Psychological interventions for the ICU professional should start in the earliest stages of a pandemic and persist throughout the course.","Branca, R.; Branca, P.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000806792.07246.d6","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):41, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27491,""
"Increasing rates of acetaminophen ingestion for self-harm in the pediatric population","BACKGROUND: Social distancing precautions due to the COVID-19 pandemic have had a detrimental physical and emotional effect. Anecdotally, hospitalizations within our health system for pediatric acetaminophen ingestions increased during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rates of pediatric intentional acetaminophen ingestion and overall self-harm admissions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. PARTICIPANTS: All discharges of patients 0 to 23 years of age admitted to the health system between 2016 and 2020 were electronically queried. Patients were identified by a primary International Classification of Disease 10 diagnosis code of acetaminophen ingestion related to self-harm [T39.1X2]. DESIGN: This is a single-centered retrospective observational study. Statistical analysis was performed using a logistic regression model. MAIN OUTCOME(S) AND MEASURE(S): The primary outcome was rate of hospitalization for acetaminophen ingestion by year. This was defined as the number of hospital discharges for acetaminophen ingestion divided by the total number of discharges per year (excluding obstetric or newborn discharges). Secondary outcomes included age, race/ethnicity, insurance, and gender. RESULTS: From 2016-2020 there were 25,927 discharges of pediatric patients with 65 acetaminophen ingestion and 148 overall self-harm discharges. Of the 65 acetaminophen patients, 78% identified as female and 54% identified as non-white. The proportion of acetaminophen ingestion admissions increased from 0.13% to 0.28% between 2016 and 2018, decreased to 0.24% in 2019, then increased to 0.44% in 2020. The proportion of self-harm ingestion admissions increased from 0.42% to 0.64% between 2016 and 2018, decreased to 0.55% in 2019, then increased to 0.73% in 2020. We found a significant increasing linear trend. The log-odds of acetaminophen ingestion admission from 2016 through 2020 increased by 28% each additional year (OR=1.28;95% CI: 1.08-1.53;p=0.01). There was not enough evidence to conclude that the log-odds of a self-harm ingestion admission were linearly related to time (p=0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Acetaminophen ingestion for self-harm has significantly increased, while overall self-harm has remained stable. It is important to note this trend and to continue to screen for depression.","Moss, R.; Hertzberg, E.; Person, H.; Zackai, S.; Bucuvalas, J.; Gillen, J.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000808792.12260.0a","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):301, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27492,""
"Pharmacist interventions in a postintensive care unit recovery clinic","INTRODUCTION: Up to 80% of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors experience post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) which is a constellation of new or worsening physical, mental and cognitive impairment that can last for years following ICU admission. Post-intensive care unit recovery clinics (PIRCs) are multidisciplinary clinics which have been developed to promote patient and family recovery following critical illness and pharmacist involvement has helped to optimize medication therapy and promote recovery. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of patients who attended PIRC at the Cleveland Clinic from December 2019-September 2020 was completed. Patients were evaluated for baseline characteristics, in-hospital and PIRC variables, and number and type of pharmacist interventions. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were seen in PIRC during the study period. The median (IQR) age was 59.1 (49.2-71.6) years and 37 (58.7%) patients were male. The median ICU and hospital length of stay were 7 (3-12.5) and 14 (10- 22) days, respectively. A total of 26 (41.3%) patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome and 52 (82.5%) had COVID-19. The median time from hospital discharge to PIRC visit was 52.5 (32-78) days and the majority of appointments were virtual (61.3%). At PIRC, 21 (45%) patients had a new oxygen requirement, 6 (38%) had an abnormal cognitive test, 11 (52%) screened positive for new anxiety or depression, and 3 (19%) screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder. Pharmacists made a median (IQR) 4 (1-6.5) interventions per patient. The majority of interventions were discontinuation of medications from a patient's medication list (59.4%), followed by adding medications which were omitted from the patient's medication list (25.5%) and updating medication records to reflect current doses and frequencies (15.2%). Routine vaccinations were recommended for 33 (52.4%) patients and education frequently included medication adherence, proper inhaler technique, management of medication adverse effects and optimal use of as needed medications. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacists are an integral member of the multidisciplinary PIRC care team. Pharmacists optimize medication therapy and provide valuable patient education. Further studies evaluating long-term outcomes of patients presenting to PIRCs and pharmacist involvement are warranted.","Torbic, H.; Conroy, G.; Ward, J.; Biehl, M.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000809736.02922.d8","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):421, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27493,""
"The 5 senses program: A patientcentered family engagement strategy","INTRODUCTION: Patients admitted to pediatric intensive care units (PICU) often experience sensory deprivation and develop maladaptive sensory disorders. Simultaneously, families often endorse feelings of helplessness and fear while their child is critically ill. This study aims to expand ICU family engagement in a unique, patient-centered manner. METHODS: This is a single-centered prospective cohort study performed at a quaternary PICU. Inclusion criteria included age &gt;12 months, were mechanically ventilated, and with a Glasgow Coma Scale &lt; 10. Exclusion criteria included those with baseline cognitive or developmental delay, palliative concerns, or to clinically unstable. The team consisted of occupational therapists and speechlanguage pathologists. Once enrolled, the team created an individualized sensory plan, including any existing sensory needs or aversions. The therapist oriented the family to the program and provided stimulation to all 5 senses. The family was provided an informational handout and a sensory kit to encourage stimulation when the therapist was not present. Following ICU discharge, the families were surveyed regarding their experience. RESULTS: From June 2019 through July 2021, 15 patients were enrolled and 12 completed surveys. Age ranged from 15 months to 17 years with a mean age of 7.6 years. The most common diagnosis was traumatic brain injury (n=5, 33%). All surveyed families provided stimulation at least 3 times following ICU transfer. 92% (n=11) participants provided stimulation more than once a day. Reported difficulty level was labeled as easy (n=9, 69%) or medium (n=3, 23%). CONCLUSIONS: Sensory stimulation can augment recovery and prevent new sensory integration disorders. These targeted plans and environmental modifications have been shown to aid in delirium prevention, family engagement, and non-pharmacologic soothing. Overall, we found that families and caregivers enjoyed the guided engagement and provided very positive feedback. There were several limitations to this project. Primarily, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the average daily PICU census was very low, inhibiting enrollment ability. Additionally, there was difficulty obtaining consults for the therapist team, thus delaying enrollment. We hope to continue to enroll patients and expand our program to other hospital units.","Dodenhoff, E.; Comer, L.; Robbins, J.; Rogers, A.; Tidwell, A.; Hayes, L.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000809796.24710.fe","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):429, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27494,""
"Phenobarbital versus benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal management: A retrospective comparison","INTRODUCTION: Benzodiazepine (BZD)-based regimens are first-line therapy for alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS). Phenobarbital (PHB) is an alternative treatment but with limited guidance for use. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of PHB compared to BZD for AWS. METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective cohort study. Adult patients were included if they received BZD symptom-triggered protocol or PHB monotherapy for management of AWS and excluded if they received both therapies, were COVID positive, or died within 48 hours of hospital admission. Data collection started on December 31, 2020 and data were collected in reverse chronological order until target sample size was attained. Primary endpoint evaluated was development of AWS-related complications. Secondary endpoints included need for adjunct therapy, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), and hospital mortality. Safety endpoints included incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, and significant respiratory depression. RESULTS: 100 patients out of 164 screened patients were included, with 50 patients in PHB and 50 patients in BZD cohorts. Baseline characteristics were similar, except more patients in PHB cohort had history of alcohol dependence (82% vs. 56%, p&lt; 0.001). Majority of BZD patients were in medical ICU while PHB patients were in surgical ICU. Baseline median MINDS scores were similar [PHB, 10 (5-16) vs. BZD, 11 (5-15), p=0.99]. Median (IQR) phenobarbital loading dose given was 14.8 (12.8-15.9) mg/kg followed by maintenance dose 356 (259-389) mg with a duration of 5 (3-5) days. Total lorazepam-equivalent dose given was 19.3 (5.0-44.0) mg with a duration of 4 (3-5) days. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint [4 (8%) vs. 4(8%), p=1.00]. MINDS score post therapy initiation was significantly higher in BZD cohort [5 (1-14) vs. 15 (8-19), p&lt; 0.001]. Patients who received PHB therapy had significantly shorter ICU LOS in days [3 (1-7) vs. 5 (2-6), p&lt; 0.001] but no difference in hospital LOS [PHB, 8 (5-13) vs. BZD, 7 (5-12), p=0.37]. There were no significant differences in other secondary and safety endpoints. CONCLUSION: In this study there was no difference in efficacy or safety of PHB in management of AWS compared to BZD. Larger studies to confirm PHB as first-line AWS therapy are warranted.","Ammar, M.; Ammar, A.; McGill, B.; Rouse, G.; Patel, A.; Becher, R.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000809968.32358.26","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):452, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27495,""
"Incidence and risk factors for iatrogenic opioid withdrawal in medical critical care patients","INTRODUCTION/HYPOTHESIS: Prolonged exposure to opioids through analgosedation may lead to iatrogenic opioid withdrawal syndrome (IWS) once patients are extubated and weaned from sedation. With the lack of validated assessment tools, IWS is likely underdiagnosed in critically ill adult patients. METHODS: This was an IRB-approved, prospective, observational study assessing IWS based on Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS) from October 2019 to November 2020. Patients were included if they were =18 years, admitted to the critical care medicine (CCM) service, and received =24 hours of continuous opioid infusion. Patients were excluded if they were admitted for drug overdose, intracranial pathology, active COVID-19, transitioned to withdrawal of life support or hospice, remained GCS =8 and/or RASS &lt; -2 throughout assessment period, prisoners, pregnant patients, or missing =2 assessments. Patients were assessed within 24 hours from opioid cessation and followed for 5 days. The primary outcome was the incidence of at least moderate IWS diagnosis assessed using COWS. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of mild IWS based on COWS, the incidence of IWS diagnosis based on a positive DSM-V score, the correlation between diagnosis of IWS by DSM-V and COWS, and the identification of risk factors for IWS. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were included in the final analysis. Except for a higher prevalence of psychiatric history in the IWS-positive group, baseline characteristics were similar. Overall, 11 patients (12%) developed at least moderate IWS, based on COWS. There was a strong, positive correlation between DSM-V and COWS on the day COWS was the highest (rs(90)=0.64;p&lt; 0.01). The IWSpositive group also had longer durations of opioid infusions, higher cumulative opioid infusion doses, higher mean daily doses, and higher infusion rates at any given time. No significant differences were found between the two groups for scheduled or PRN opioids after cessation of the opioid infusion. Logistic regression did not identify any independent predictors for the development of IWS. CONCLUSION: At least 12% of CCM patients who received =24 hours of continuous opioid infusions developed IWS. These patients had significantly longer durations, higher cumulative daily and total opioid doses, and higher opioid infusion rates.","Fox, M.; Carothers, W.; Birrer, K.; Choi, M.; Dircksen, K.; Mukkera, S.

"A case of severe rhabdomyolysis and acute myocarditis in an adolescent female","INTRODUCTION: Rhabdomyolysis describes a condition where muscle tissue destruction occurs. Mortality and morbidity can be significant especially when multi-organ injury ensues. In very few instances, myocarditis has been described in association with this condition. DESCRIPTION: An 11-year-old previously healthy female presents with vomiting, diarrhea, tactile fever, worsening severe bilateral leg pain and gross hematuria for four days. At the Emergency Department, her ECG showed ST depression in lateral leads and abnormal Q waves. Laboratory studies were notable for significantly elevated CK &gt;330,000 U/L. Elevated Troponin T and Troponin I at 3.60 ng/ml and 0.54 ng/mL, respectively. Elevation of CRP 23.5 mg/dl, ALT 1,966 U/L, AST 5,956 U/L, and Ferritin 712.1 ng/ml. Patient had dark brown urine, which was positive for blood, and urine myoglobin peaked at 2690 ng/mL. Her renal function was normal with blood urea nitrogen 8 mg/dl and creatinine 0.4 mg/dl. C3 and C4 levels were decreased, 45 mg/dl and 5 mg/dl, respectively. Anti-dsDNA negative, ANCA negative, and ANA negative. Nasopharyngeal PCR was negative for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, influenza A and B. Blood enterovirus PCR negative. COVID PCR and antibodies negative. Neuromuscular genetic testing was non-diagnostic. Her echocardiography showed thin rim of pericardial effusion and normal ejection fraction. Cardiac MRI demonstrated myocardial edema and regional sub-epicardial delayed enhancement consistent with acute myocarditis. Patient was started on hyperhydration therapy, Solumedrol and intravenous immunoglobulin. The rhabdomyolysis resulted in severe extremity weakness requiring prolonged rehabilitation. Her condition and biomarkers normalized and was subsequently discharged home. Follow up cardiac MRI 6 months later showed increased extracellular volume (ECV) of 38% suggestive of focal and diffuse areas of fibrosis. Patient remains under physical activity restrictions and is being followed by cardiology service. DISCUSSION: Our case highlights severe rhabdomyolysis in association with acute myocarditis and subsequent cardiac structural abnormalities. Although it remains unclear whether myocarditis evolved as a complication of rhabdomyolysis or was triggered by same inciting agent, an infectious etiology overall remains the most likely culprit.","Abderrahman, Y.; Deepthi Billa, R.; Weiner, L.; Khan, R.; Lee-son, K.; Badheka, A.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000811712.24270.46","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):675, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27497,""
"Effect of alternatives to opiates program on discharge opioid prescribing in trauma patients","INTRODUCTION: Opioid overdose deaths increased over two decades, with the incidence accelerated further during the COVID-19 pandemic. While opioids remain mainstay for trauma-related pain management, organizations are focused on reducing use. This study aimed to determine if a hospitalwide Alternatives to Opiates (ALTO) program reduced opioid prescribing at discharge after trauma. METHODS: A single-center, retrospective analysis of patients =18 years old admitted for =24 hours with primary diagnosis of traumatic injury between August 1, 2018 - October 31, 2019 was performed. Admissions before July 1, 2019, represent the control group, whereas admissions on/after represent the ALTO group. Patients with alcohol or polysubstance abuse, chronic opioid use, or in-hospital mortality were excluded. The primary outcome was incidence of opioid prescribing at discharge. Secondary outcomes were percent with in-hospital non-opioid and multimodal analgesia, and hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS). A sample size of 129 patients was needed to observe a 30% reduction in primary outcome and maintain 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference using alpha &lt; 0.05. RESULTS: A total of 703 patients were included, 471 in the control and 232 in the ALTO groups. Mean age was 59Â±22 years and 58.7% were male. Mean initial Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 9.1Â±7.7 and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2.7Â±2.7. In-hospital opioid prescribing was higher (70.4% vs. 87.5%, p&lt; 0.0001), and opioid discontinuation at hospital discharge occurred less frequently (60.5% vs. 56.2%, p=0.1237) after ALTO implementation. Surgical intervention, lack of ICU admission, ISS =9 and CCI =1 was associated with lower incidence of opioid discontinuation at discharge in both groups. Most patients received nonopioid (93.6 vs. 98.7%, p=0.0051) and multimodal analgesia (84.3% vs. 87.5%, p=0.3083) during hospitalization. Median hospital LOS [5(3-9) vs. 4(3-7), p=0.3427] and ICU LOS [2(0-4) vs. 3(2-5), p=0.3461] were similar. CONCLUSIONS: Opioids remain mainstay for traumarelated pain management. In our study, ALTO was not associated with a reduction in in-hospital opioid prescribing or at discharge. Identification and implementation of strategies to further reduce opioid prescribing at discharge in trauma patients are needed.","Johnston, J.; Nerenberg, S.; LaPietra, A.; Wang, A.; Kulig, C.; Foran, L.; Hlayhel, A.; Yang, J.; Parmar, D.; Elsawy, O.","https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ccm.0000812536.34842.d8","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Critical Care Medicine; 50(1 SUPPL):780, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27498,""
"Impact of Covid-19 pandemic on female health care workers in Odisha (India)","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on female health workers (FHWs) in Odisha (India). Here, this study discusses the economic hardship of the FHWs during the pandemic time. Additionally, this study also identifies the various socio-economic factors responsible for the increasing mental stress level of FHWs in Odisha. Design/methodology/approach - The study is based on a telephonic survey method. Overall the study has collected 80 samples of FHWs from Odisha (India). Additionally, the study uses a logistic regression model to measure the impact of various socio-economic factors affecting the mental health status of FHWs during the pandemic time. Findings - The findings of this study depict that FHWs working as a Covid warrior during the pandemic time are facing severe economic vulnerability in their life. It is found that though the FHWs have worked tirelessly to save millions of human lives, but irregularity in salary payment and temporary jobs position have caused more mental distress to them. Moreover, the empirical findings have shown that factors such as joint family, social isolation, having an elderly member in their family, duty in Covid ward, staying in staff quarter and temporary job position are responsible for increasing the mental stress of FHWs in Odisha during the Covid-19 pandemic time. Originality/value - This study is a first attempt to explain the life struggle, economic vulnerability and mental stress of Indian (Odisha) FHWs working during the Covid-19 pandemic period to save millions of human lives.","Pattayat, S.

"Understanding the Impact of COVID-19 on Online Mental Health Forums","Like many of the disasters that have preceded it, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a profound impact on people's mental health. Understanding its impact can inform strategies for mitigating negative consequences. This work seeks to better understand the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health by examining how discussions on mental health subreddits have changed in the three months following theWHO's declaration of a global pandemic. First, the rate at which the pandemic is discussed in each community is quantified. Then, volume of activity is measured to determine whether the number of people with mental health concerns has risen, and user interactions are analyzed to determine how they have changed during the pandemic. Finally, the content of the discussions is analyzed. Each of these metrics is considered with respect to a set of control subreddits to better understand if the changes present are specific to mental health subreddits or are representative of Reddit as a whole. There are numerous changes in the three mental health subreddits that we consider, r/Anxiety, r/depression, r/SuicideWatch;there is reduced posting activity in most cases, and there are significant changes in discussion of some topics such as work and anxiety. The results suggest that there is not an overwhelming increase in online mental health support-seeking on Reddit during the pandemic, but that discussion content related to mental health has changed.","Biester, L.; Matton, K.; Rajendran, J.; Provost, E.

"Sick Leave and Intention to Quit the Job among Nursing Staff in German Hospitals during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: Sick leave and turnover of nurses exacerbate an already existing nursing shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany and other countries. Frequency and associated factors of sick leave and intention to quit among nurses need to be examined to maintain healthcare. Methods: An online survey among nursing staff (N = 757) in German hospitals was conducted between May and July 2021. Sick leave days, intention to quit, working conditions, depression, anxiety and sleep disorder symptoms, effort-reward imbalance (ERI), COVID-19-related and sociode-mographic variables were measured. Regression analyses were performed. Results: The intention to quit was present in 18.9%. One third (32.5%) reported sick leave of =10 and 12.3% more than 25 days in 12 months. Significant predictors for =10 sick leave days were infection with SARS-CoV-2, a pre-existing illness, exhaustion, trust in colleagues and fear of becoming infected. Higher ERI reward levels, perception of sufficient staff and contact with infected patients were associated with lower odds for =10 sick leave days. Lower reward levels, having changed work departments during the pandemic, working part-time and higher depression levels significantly predicted turnover intention. Conclusion: Alarmingly, many nurses intend to quit working in healthcare. Perceived reward seems to buffer both sick leave and turnover intention. Enhancing protection from COVID-19 and reducing workload might also prevent sick leave. Depression prevention, improved change management and support of part-time workers could contribute to reducing turnover intention among nurses.","Schug, C.; Geiser, F.; Hiebel, N.; Beschoner, P.; Jerg-Bretzke, L.; Albus, C.; Weidner, K.; Morawa, E.; Erim, Y.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19041947","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27503,""
"Predictors of Short-Term Alcohol Drinking in Patients with Alcohol Use Disorders during the Third Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Prospective Study in Three Addiction Outpatient Centers in France","The present study investigates the extent to which the COVID-19 crisis disturbed different life domains of patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and assessed the associations between these disturbances and the risk of short-term alcohol drinking. All patients aged &gt;18 years receiving outpatient care at three addiction treatment facilities from 15 April to 30 May 2021 were eligible for inclusion in the study. A trained resident assessed the extent to which the COVID-19 crisis affected their professional activity, social life, access to healthcare, and drinking problems, together with craving, drinking behavior, psychological distress, physical/mental health, and sociodemographic and clinical data. The same investigator assessed alcohol drinking 1 month after their visit. Nearly half of the patients felt that the COVID-19 crisis had a serious impact on their drinking problems, despite minor disruptions in access to healthcare. These disturbances significantly influenced short-term alcohol drinking in univariate analysis, together with psychological distress, craving, and drinking problems. Only craving predicted alcohol drinking in multivariate analyses, suggesting that psychological and drinking problems, as well as COVID-19 disturbances, increased the risk of alcohol drinking by increasing craving. Craving should be systematically investigated in patients with AUD to establish adapted social support systems during pandemics.","Constant, A.; Sanz, M.; Moirand, R.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19041948","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27504,""
"Social Health among German Nursing Home Residents with Dementia during the COVID-19 Pandemic, and the Role of Technology to Promote Social Participation","The COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted the social health of nursing home residents with dementia due to social isolation. Consequently, the frequency of Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia (BPSD) might increase. Technological solutions might help safeguard the social health of nursing home residents with dementia. This study investigates the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical outcomes and the availability of social activities and technology to promote social participation in nursing home residents with dementia. The study analyzed cross-sectional data from a follow-up questionnaire nested in a larger national survey of care facilities in Germany. A mixed-methods approach integrated statistical analyses of closed-ended responses and thematic analysis of free-text responses. A total of 417 valid individual responses were received, showing an overall increase in observed BPSDâ€”with anxiety and depression most frequently occurring. Many nursing homes canceled all social activities for residents with dementia, though a few had established procedures to facilitate social participation using technology. Requirements to promote social participation in this population using technology were identified at the micro-, meso-, and macro levels. Technology requirements permeated all three levels. During and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, technology-driven solutions to promote social health among nursing home residents with dementia should be integrated into caregiving procedures.","Hoel, V.; Seibert, K.; Domhoff, D.; PreuÃŸ, B.; Heinze, F.; Rothgang, H.; Wolf-Ostermann, K.","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19041956","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health; 19(4), 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27505,""
"Experiences of Perinatal Mental Health Care among Minority Ethnic Women during the COVID-19 Pandemic in London: A Qualitative Study","(1) Background: Approximately one in five women will experience mental health difficulties in the perinatal period. Women from ethnic minority backgrounds face a variety of barriers that can prevent or delay access to appropriate perinatal mental health care. COVID-19 pandemic restrictions created additional obstacles for this group of women. This study aims to explore minority ethnic womenâ€™s experiences of perinatal mental health services during COVID-19 in London. (2) Methods: Eighteen women from ethnic minority backgrounds were interviewed, and data were subject to a thematic analysis.

We conducted a cross-sectional web-based study aimed at evaluating the psychological impact (BSI-18) of the COVID-19 pandemic on this population and collecting information on the perinatal experiences (COPE-IS) during the second Italian wave. Overall, 1168 pregnant women, and 940 within the first six months after childbirth, were recruited in selected Italian Family Care Centers from October 2020 to May 2021. The prevalence of psychological distress symptoms during pregnancy was 12.1% and 9.3% in the postnatal group. Financial difficulties, a previous mood or anxiety disorder and lack of perceived social support and of support provided by health professionals were associated to psychological distress symptoms in both groups. A third of the women felt unsupported by their social network;61.7% of the pregnant women experienced changes in antenatal care;21.2% of those in the postnatal period gave birth alone;more than 80% of the participants identified access to medical and mental health care and self-help as important resources in the present context.

"Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Temporal Topic Models and Clinical Text Data Identify COVID-19 Pandemic Effects on Primary Healthcare and Community Health in Toronto, Canada","To demonstrate how non-negative matrix factorization can be used to learn a temporal topic model over a large collection of primary care clinical notes, characterizing diverse COVID-19 pandemic effects on the physical/mental/social health of residents of Toronto, Canada. The study employs a retrospective open cohort design, consisting of 382,666 primary care progress notes from 44,828 patients, 54 physicians, and 12 clinics collected 01/01/2017 through 31/12/2020. Non-negative matrix factorization uncovers a meaningful latent topical structure permeating the corpus of primary care notes. The learned latent topical basis is transformed into a multivariate time series data structure. Time series methods and plots showcase the evolution/dynamics of learned topics over the study period and allow the identification of COVID-19 pandemic effects. We perform several post-hoc checks of model robustness to increase trust that descriptive/unsupervised inferences are stable over hyper-parameter configurations and/or data perturbations. Temporal topic modelling uncovers a myriad of pandemic-related effects from the expressive clinical text data. In terms of direct effects on patient-health, topics encoding respiratory disease symptoms display altered dynamics during the pandemic year. Further, the pandemic was associated with a multitude of indirect patient-level effects on topical domains representing mental health, sleep, social and familial dynamics, measurement of vitals/labs, uptake of prevention/screening maneuvers, and referrals to medical specialists. Finally, topic models capture changes in primary care practice patterns resulting from the pandemic, including changes in EMR documentation strategies and the uptake of telemedicine. Temporal topic modelling applied to a large corpus of rich primary care clinical text data, can identify a meaningful topical/thematic summarization which can provide policymakers and public health stakeholders a passive, cost-effective, technology for understanding holistic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the primary healthcare system and community/public-health.","Meaney, Escobar, Moineddin, Stukel, Kalia, Aliarzadeh, Chen, O'Neill, Greiver","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbi.2022.104034","20220224","COVID-19; Electronic medical record; Non-negative matrix factorization; Temporal topic modelling; Text mining; Time series analysis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27508,""
"Pediatric Emergency Department Visits Associated with Mental Health Conditions Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic - United States, January 2019-January 2022","In 2021, a national emergency* for children's mental health was declared by several pediatric health organizations, and the U.S. Surgeon General released an advisory<sup>Ã¢â‚¬Â </sup> on mental health among youths. These actions resulted from ongoing concerns about children's mental health in the United States, which was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic (1,2). During March-October 2020, among all emergency department (ED) visits, the proportion of mental health-related visits increased by 24% among U.S. children aged 5-11 years and 31% among adolescents aged 12-17 years, compared with 2019 (2). CDC examined changes in U.S. pediatric ED visits for overall mental health conditions (MHCs) and ED visits associated with specific MHCs (depression; anxiety; disruptive behavioral and impulse-control disorders; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; trauma and stressor-related disorders; bipolar disorders; eating disorders; tic disorders; and obsessive-compulsive disorders [OCD]) during 2019 through January 2022 among children and adolescents aged 0-17 years, overall and by sex and age. After declines in weekly visits associated with MHCs among those aged 0-17 years during 2020, weekly numbers of ED visits for MHCs overall and for specific MHCs varied by age and sex during 2021 and January 2022, when compared with corresponding weeks in 2019. Among adolescent females aged 12-17 years, weekly visits increased for two of nine MHCs during 2020 (eating disorders and tic disorders), for four of nine MHCs during 2021 (depression, eating disorders, tic disorders, and OCD), and for five of nine MHCs during January 2022 (anxiety, trauma and stressor-related disorders, eating disorders, tic disorders, and OCD), and overall MHC visits during January 2022, compared with 2019.

"Changes in Suicide Rates - United States, 2019 and 2020","Suicide was among the 10 leading causes of death in the United States in 2020 among persons aged 10-64 years, and the second leading cause of death among children and adolescents aged 10-14 and adults aged 25-34 years (1). During 1999-2020, nearly 840,000 lives were lost to suicide in the United States. During that period, the overall suicide rate peaked in 2018 and declined in 2019 and 2020 (1). Despite the recent decline in the suicide rate, factors such as social isolation, economic decline, family stressors, new or worsening mental health symptoms, and disruptions to work and school associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have raised concerns about suicide risk in the United States. During 2020, a total of 12.2 million U.S. adults reported serious thoughts of suicide and 1.2 million attempted suicide (2). To understand how changes in suicide death rates might have varied among subpopulations, CDC analyzed counts and age-adjusted suicide rates during 2019 and 2020 by demographic characteristics, mechanism of injury, county urbanization level, and state. From 2019 to 2020, the suicide rate declined by 3% overall, including 8% among females and 2% among males. Significant declines occurred in seven states but remained stable in the other states and the District of Columbia. Despite two consecutive years of declines, the overall suicide rate remains 30% higher compared with that in 2000 (1). A comprehensive approach to suicide prevention that uses data driven decision-making and implements prevention strategies with the best available evidence, especially among disproportionately affected populations (3), is critical to realizing further declines in suicide and reaching the national goal of reducing the suicide rate by 20% by 2025 (4).","Ehlman, Yard, Stone, Jones, Mack","https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7108a5","20220224","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27510,""

"Health anxiety During COVID-19: Predictive Roles of Health Promoting Behaviors and Sensory Processing Sensitivity","The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in major changes in daily life and economic conditions while heightening physical and mental health problems, including health anxiety. Health authorities and elected officials have encouraged individuals to engage in health behaviors. Perceptions of and reactions to these changes could be subject to individual differences. In this line, the current study investigated the predictive roles of health promoting behaviors, sensory processing sensitivity, and their interactions with health anxiety.Design and measures: In this cross-sectional study, 355 participants (73% female, 25.9% male) whose ages range from 19 to 72 (<i>MÃ¢â‚¬â€°=</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°25.91, <i>SD =</i> 9.80) filled out self-reported measures on health promoting behaviors, sensory processing sensitivity, and health anxiety <i>via</i> an online platform between April and May 2020. It was revealed that caring for a healthy diet, taking responsibility for health and sensory processing sensitivity, but not physical activity and stress management, were associated with health anxiety. Diagnoses and perceptions of physical and mental health problems also contributed to health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with higher levels of sensory processing sensitivity and health responsibility were more likely to experience higher levels of health anxiety, while typical physical activities and stress management behaviors were less likely to have an impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results highlight the importance of having a healthy diet and the need for pandemic-specific interventions for stress management and sport activities.","GÃƒÂ¼neÃ…Å¸, Bulut","https://doi.org/10.1080/00223980.2021.2012110","20220224","COVID-19; health anxiety; health promoting behaviors; interaction; sensory processing sensitivity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27513,""

This study aims to evaluate the psychologic morbidity and alterations in medical care caused by the pandemic. Advanced-stage ovarian cancer survivors at our institution were contacted for participation in a cross-sectional telephone-based quantitative survey study assessing pandemic-related psychologic morbidity. Psychologic domains using validated measures were explored: health-related quality of life (HRQOL; functional assessment of cancer therapy [FACT-G7]), anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder-7 [GAD7]), depression (Patient Health Questionnarie-2 [PHQ2]), global health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Global Physical Health/Global Mental Health (PROMIS-GMH/GPH), resilience (brief resilience scale), and loneliness (English Longitudinal Study on Aging). Novel COVID-19 pandemic questions were drawn from a larger survey developed in our department. Fifty-nine percent (61 of 104) of contacted patients completed the survey. One quarter of respondents had high resilience, with only 10% reporting low resilience. Only one patient screened positive for depression, and two for anxiety. Increased loneliness was reported by 43% of respondents. Patients' overall HRQOL was good (median = 21; range = 6-28). Few patients experienced treatment delays, with only four experiencing chemotherapy interruption and two reporting surgical delays. Multiple regression analyses revealed that high FACT-G7 HRQOL was predicted by age &gt; 65 years, high self-reported mental health, high resilience, and being off chemotherapy. Lower COVID-19 concern was predicted by recurrent cancer and high resilience. Despite the far-reaching impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, ovarian cancer survivors' HRQOL has been maintained.

"The impact of operational partnership on telemental health before, during, and after COVID-19","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic significantly accelerated the growth of telehealth services within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), as the use of video conferencing to meet with Veterans in their homes increased tenfold in a 3-month period. A substantial portion of telehealth in VHA has traditionally comprised mental health services, and both the scope and volume of such services were significantly broadened in response to COVID-19 to allow for social distancing. The current article is a review of this mobilization from the framework of the People, Process, Technology, and Information model, with a particular highlight on the critical operational partnership between individual facilities providing care and the governing VHA program offices. Lessons learned and future goals for the sustainment and integration of telemental health services are also discussed.

"Provider perspectives on telemental health implementation: Lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and paths forward","After years of slow and fragmented implementation of telemental health (TMH), the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic necessitated widespread adoption. With the initial state of public health emergency behind us, we are at a decision point on whether to continue with TMH or return to a largely in-person care model. In this qualitative study, we investigated clinicians' perspectives on advantages and disadvantages of TMH in outpatient mental healthcare as well as considerations for future implementation. We conducted 29 semistructured interviews with outpatient mental health providers. Data were analyzed using rapid qualitative analysis methodology. Advantages included increased utilization of services, improved therapeutic processes, and improved provider wellbeing. Providers, however, also noted that TMH has some disadvantages in terms of therapeutic processes and provider wellbeing, and they reported technology issues as an additional disadvantage. Overall providers reported they can provide high quality care via TMH, but indicated some patient populations and appointment types are a better fit for in-person services. Most providers preferred a hybrid model of care moving forward with reimbursement discrepancies and out-of-state licensure restrictions as barriers. They indicated that, as TMH becomes a mainstay in psychiatric care, training and professional guidelines will be important. Continued implementation of TMH alongside in-person care is likely to offer improved access and enhanced service quality when applied to the right patient populations and appointment types. Effective implementation may require policy and systems level support on equitable reimbursement rates, out-of-state licensure restrictions and professional guidelines for delivering TMH.

"Women's Mental Health Services and Pregnancy: A Review","The importance of women's mental health services is becoming more evident as we learn more about the impact of mental health on maternal and perinatal outcomes. The purpose of this review is to identify the importance of mental health issues arising during pregnancy including prevention, timely diagnosis and treatment, and referral to specialized services. A literature search was undertaken using the search engines PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. The search terms were as follows: ""mental health services"" or ""behavioral health"" or ""mental health counseling"" or ""psychological"" and ""delivery of health care"" and ""pregnancy"" or ""pregnant."" The years searched were January 2000 to November 2020. The search was limited to English language. Of the 255 abstracts identified and reviewed, 35 full-text articles were the basis of this review. Literature summarizing the availability and models of care for mental health services for pregnant women is limited. After reviewing the literature, the themes of depression and anxiety in the antepartum and postpartum periods that emerged as mental health issues, especially during adolescent pregnancies, the coronavirus pandemic, intimate partner violence, and pregnancy loss, are of primary importance to obstetrical providers. All of these issues can have a significant impact on maternal and neonatal outcomes and should be addressed during routine practice. Maternal mental health is garnering deserved attention and has enormous implications on maternal and infant outcomes. Obstetrical providers should be comfortable with screening, identification, and basic treatment algorithms including when to refer to specialized services. Mental health issues during pregnancy and the postpartum period can be profound with severe maternal and perinatal consequences.","Ghahremani, Magann, Phillips, Ray-Griffith, Coker, Stowe","https://doi.org/10.1097/OGX.0000000000000994","20220224","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27517,""
"The Impact of Long COVID-19 on Mental Health: Observational 6-Month Follow-Up Study","The psychological impact of COVID-19 can be substantial. However, knowledge about long-term psychological outcomes in patients with COVID-19 is scarce. In this longitudinal, observational study, we aimed to reveal symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and symptoms of anxiety and depression up to 6 months after the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms in patients with confirmed COVID-19 and persistent complaints. To demonstrate the impact in nonhospitalized patients, we further aimed to compare these outcomes between nonhospitalized and hospitalized patients. Demographics, symptoms of PTSD (Trauma Screening Questionnaire [TSQ] Ã¢â€°Â¥6 points) and symptoms of anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] Ã¢â€°Â¥8 points) were assessed at 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms in members of online long COVID-19 peer support groups. Data from 239 patients with confirmed COVID-19 (198/239, 82.8% female; median age: 50 [IQR 39-56] years) were analyzed. At the 3-month follow-up, 37.2% (89/239) of the patients had symptoms of PTSD, 35.6% (85/239) had symptoms of anxiety, and 46.9% (112/239) had symptoms of depression, which remained high at the 6-month follow-up (64/239, 26.8%, P=.001; 83/239, 34.7%, P=.90; 97/239, 40.6%, P=.08, respectively; versus the 3-month follow-up). TSQ scores and HADS anxiety and depression scores were strongly correlated at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups (r=0.63-0.71, P&lt;.001). Symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were comparable between hospitalized (n=62) and nonhospitalized (n=177) patients. A substantial percentage of patients with confirmed COVID-19 and persistent complaints reported symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, or depression 3 and 6 months after the onset of COVID-19-related symptoms. The prevalence rates of symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression were comparable between hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients and merely improved over time. Health care professionals need to be aware of these psychological complications and intervene on time in post-COVID-19 patients with persistent complaints.

"Emotional distress among health professionals involved in care of inpatients with COVID-19: a survey based cross-sectional study","Health care workers (HCWs) are directly involved in processes linked with diagnosis, management, and assistance of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients which could have direct implications on their physical and emotional health. Emotional aspects of working in an infectious pandemic situation is often neglected in favour of the more obvious physical ramifications. This single point assessment study aimed to explore the factors related to stress, anxiety and depression among HCWs consequent to working in a pandemic. This was a cross-sectional study involving healthcare workers who were working in COVID-19 inpatient ward, COVID-19 screening area, suspect ward, suspect intensive care unit (ICU) and COVID-19 ICU across four hospitals in India. A web-based survey questionnaire was designed to elicit responses to daily challenges faced by HCWs. The questionnaire was regressed using machine-learning algorithm (Cat Boost) against the standardized Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale - 21 (DASS 21) which was used to quantify emotional distress experienced by them. A total of 156 participants were included in this study. As per DASS-21 scoring, severe stress was seen in Ã¢Ë†Â¼17% of respondents. We could achieve an RÃ‚Â² of 0.28 using our machine-learning model. The major factors responsible for stress were decreased time available for personal needs, increasing age, being posted out of core area of expertise, setting of COVID-19 care, increasing duty hours, increasing duty days, marital status and being a resident physician. Factors elicited in this study that are associated with stress in HCWs need to be addressed to provide wholesome emotional support to HCWs battling the pandemic. Targeted interventions may result in increased emotional resilience of the health-care system.","Jalandra, Shahul, Asfahan, Garg, Nebhinani, Dutt, Chauhan, Swami, Bhatia, Bhardwaj, Suthar, Kumar, Kumawat, Andani, Misra","https://doi.org/10.5603/ARM.a2022.0026","20220224","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; emotional distress; health-care worker; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27519,""
"You've Got a Friend in Me: Fostering Social Connection Among College Students Through Peer-Led Physical Activity","Social connection and physical activity (PA) are essential health behaviors necessary for young adults to thrive. The majority of college students in the United States are not meeting PA recommendations and simultaneously report concerning rates of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and fatigue; all factors that contribute to poor psychological well-being and reduce students' abilities to sustain academic success. These mental and physical health indicators have only worsened due to the stress, isolation, and uncertainty experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fitness Buddies (FB) is a free peer-led PA program designed to combat loneliness, stress, anxiety, depression, and low PA, by providing students the opportunity to connect with one another through PA. FB participants are matched with a peer leader for weekly PA sessions based on activity interests and schedules. The FB program model shifts the focus of traditional PA programs, from prescribing and monitoring PA duration, intensity and modalities, to supporting psychological well-being through satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs of competence, autonomy, and relatedness within peer PA-based relationships. In the first pilot phase of implementation, students reported improved situational affect, to include reduced stress and anxiety, following participation in the FB program for one academic semester. Participants also reported the development of quality peer relationships and a sense of belonging to the campus community, both of which had previously been lacking. The FB program model is an innovative and cost-efficient strategy to supporting college students' psychological well-being and long-term success.","Kirby, Babkes Stellino, Lewis, Humphrey, Gordon, Lindsay","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399211072535","20220224","college students; health promotion; mental health; physical activity; psychological well-being; social connection","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27520,""

"A narrative review into the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on senior high school adolescent mental health","High school teenagers are facing significant challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. Teenagers are at risk of experiencing physical, mental, and social health problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This narrative review aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 on the emergence of mental health problems in high school adolescents. This study employed a narrative review method. We conducted a systematic search using PRISMA on three databases: Medline, PubMed, and ScienceDirect. A total of 40 articles met the inclusion and exclusion criteria set based on the research objectives. The study uncovered that high school adolescents had an increased risk of experiencing mental health problems, namely psychological distress, worry, loneliness, anxiety, depression, traumatic symptoms, other psychological disorders, suicide risk, sleep disorders, and psychosocial functioning. Anxiety, depression, and psychological stress were the most discussed mental health problems among high school adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a need for efforts to identify health problems and intervene in mental health problems early in high school adolescents. Schools, mental health workers, and the government (e.g., policy stakeholders) need to implement the recommendations given as a follow-up effort for mental health services for high school youth.","Windarwati, Lestari, Supianto, Wicaksono, Ati, Kusumawati, Humayya, Ekawati","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcap.12370","20220224","COVID-19; adolescent; high school; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27522,""
"Covid-19, social restrictions, and mental distress among young people: a UK longitudinal, population-based study","Adolescence is a critical period for social and emotional development. We sought to examine the impacts of Covid-19 and related social restrictions and school closures on adolescent mental health, particularly among disadvantaged, marginalised, and vulnerable groups. We analysed four waves of data - 3 pre-Covid-19 (2016-2019) and 1 mid-Covid-19 (May-Aug 2020; n, 1074; 12-18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old, &gt;80% minority ethnic groups, 25% free school meals) from REACH (Resilience, Ethnicity, and AdolesCent Mental Health), an adolescent cohort based in inner-London, United Kingdom. Mental health was assessed using validated measures at each time point. We estimated temporal trends in mental distress and examined variations in changes in distress, pre- to mid-Covid-19, by social group, and by pre- and mid-pandemic risks. We found no evidence of an overall increase in mental distress midpandemic (15.9%, 95% CI: 13.0, 19.4) compared with prepandemic (around 18%). However, there were variations in changes in mental distress by subgroups. There were modest variations by social group and by pre-Covid risks (e.g., a small increase in distress among girls (b [unstandardised beta coefficient] 0.42 [-0.19, 1.03]); a small decrease among boys (bÃ¢â‚¬â€°-Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.59 [-1.37, 0.19]); p for interaction .007). The most notable variations were by midpandemic risks: that is, broadly, increases in distress among those reporting negative circumstances and impacts (e.g., in finances, housing, social support and relationships, and daily routines) and decreases in distress among those reporting positive impacts. We found strong evidence that mental distress increased among young people who were most negatively impacted by Covid-19 and by related social restrictions during the first lockdown in the United Kingdom.","Knowles, Gayer-Anderson, Turner, Dorn, Lam, Davis, Blakey, Lowis, Pinfold, Creary, Dyer, Hatch, Ploubidis, Bhui, Harding, Morgan","https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13586","20220224","Covid-19; adolescence; cohort; mental distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27523,""

All of the included studies assessed general population samples. Pre-COVID-19 research focused primarily on television coverage alone or on multiple media forms including television, while COVID-19 media studies examined various media forms including social media. Most studies used cross-sectional design and non-probability sampling. The review revealed inconclusive findings across studies. The study of mass trauma media effects on depression in children is complicated by a number of potential confounding factors and by the relatively high prevalence of depression in the general population. Media contact was a relatively minor consideration among other interests in the extant studies which failed to explore numerous issues that warrant attention in future research.","Pfefferbaum, Tucker, NitiÃƒÂ©ma, Van Horn, Varma, Varma, Slaughter, Newman","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11920-022-01328-1","20220224","Children and COVID-19; Children and disasters; Children and terrorism; Depression; Disaster media coverage; Mass trauma media coverage","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27524,""

In June 2020, we interviewed 32 PLHIV who identified as men who have sex with men, persons who inject drugs, female sex workers, or transgender after Vietnam's strict quarantine period. While most participants were knowledgeable regarding COVID-19 transmission and prevention, COVID-19 was perceived more as a threat to individual rather than community health. The pandemic affected PLHIV significantly. Many lost employment with reduced income and increased family stress and conflict. Travel restrictions and unemployment affected access to antiretroviral (ARV) medication, particularly for transgender PLHIV who obtain ARVs from unofficial sources. Participants recounted substantial mental health effects, including worry, stress, and boredom. However, some respondents reported positive effects on family relationships. After quarantine, most reported feeling better, although financial worries persisted.

This study examined the associations between mental health status, oral health status, and oral healthcare utilization and highlighted the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. Additionally, this study examines specific sociodemographic factors that may amplify oral health disparities. A nationally representative survey was conducted to capture attitudes, experiences, and behaviors related to oral health, mental health, and unmet oral health needs. Eighteen percent of respondents were categorized as having poor mental health. Visiting the dentist in the last year was more common amongst individuals with good mental health. From the logistic regression model, mental health status, age group, race/ethnicity, education, and last dental visit were all significantly associated with of oral health status. Mental health status, age group, and income groups were all significantly associated with unmet oral health need.

"PTSD Symptoms and Functional Impairment among Nurses Treating COVID-19 Patients","Nurses providing direct care for patients with COVID-19 may be at particular risk for developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, little is known about how these symptoms are related to workplace and non-workplace impairment. We examined if PTSD symptoms mediated the relationship between treating patients with COVID-19 and functional impairment. An online survey collected data regarding demographic and workplace variables, PTSD symptoms, functional impairment, distracted practice, and if the nurse treated patients with confirmed COVID-19. Data collected in November 2020 from 218 primarily White and female nurses were analyzed. We followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines in reporting the methods and results. Analyses involved two steps: (a) calculating descriptive statistics, conducting univariate tests, and examining correlations among study variables; and (b) conducting a path analysis examining the mediating role of PTSD symptoms in the relationship between treating patients with COVID-19 and functional outcomes. Univariate tests found that nurses who had a diploma/associate's/bachelor's and nurses who treated patients with COVID-19 reported more PTSD symptoms, functional impairment, and distracted practice compared to nurses with graduate degrees and those who did not treat patients with COVID-19. Compared to nurses who reported having access to adequate PPE, nurses who reported not having access to adequate PPE reported more PTSD symptoms but lower functional impairment and distracted practice. Men reported lower distracted practice scores than women. In step two of the analyses, the path model suggested that treating patients with COVID-19 was indirectly related to both distracted practice and functional impairment through PTSD symptoms. The probable PTSD symptoms and work- and non-work-related functional impairment of nurses working with patients with COVID-19 highlight the importance of developing interventions that help these essential workers address vulnerabilities associated with working during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ayotte, Schierberl Scherr, Kellogg","https://doi.org/10.1177/23779608221074651","20220224","COVID-19; PTSD, mental health; functional impairment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27527,""
"Knowledge, Attitudes, Behavioural Practises, and Psychological Impact Relating to COVID-19 Among People Living With Spinal Cord Injury During In-Patient Rehabilitation in Bangladesh","The aim of this research is to focus on gaining an insight into the knowledge, attitudes, behavioural practises (KAP), and psychological impact relating to COVID-19 among the people living with spinal cord injury receiving in-patient rehabilitation. A prospective, cross-sectional survey of people with SCI (<i>N</i> = 207), who were in active in-patient rehabilitation from two tertiary SCI Rehabilitation Centres in Bangladesh. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews, after voluntary consent, using a pretested, language validated questionnaire on Knowledge, Attitude and Behavioural practises (KAP) and the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale (DASS-21). Ethical approval and trial registration were obtained prospectively. A total of 207 people with SCI responded, among which 87% were men and 13% were women, with a mean age of 34.18 Ã‚Â± 12.9 years. Within the sample group, people living with tetraplegia comprised 33.8%, and people living with paraplegia comprised 66.2%. Overall, 63.8% of the participants were diagnosed with an SCI categorised as ASIA-A. Overall, the ""knowledge score"" was 8.59 Ã‚Â± 2.3 out of 12, ""depression"" was 11.18 Ã‚Â± 8, ""anxiety"" was 7.72 Ã‚Â± 5.1, and ""stress"" was 9.32 Ã‚Â± 6.7 from a total of 21 scores each category.

"Effects of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Its Relationship With Death Attitudes and Coping Styles Among Hungarian, Norwegian, and Turkish Psychology Students","The purpose of this study was to investigate mental effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its relationship with death attitudes and coping styles among Hungarian, Norwegian, and Turkish psychology students. A total of 388 participants from Hungary (<i>N</i> = 122, 31.4%), Norway (<i>N</i> = 96, 24.7%), and Turkey (<i>N</i> = 170, 43.8%) were recruited during the pandemic. The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale, the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Carver Brief COPE Inventory, and the Death Attitude Profile-Revised were used. The results indicated that escape acceptance might be the most maladaptive death attitude during COVID-19, as it was related to poorer mental health among the Hungarian, Norwegian, and Turkish psychology students. Self-blame, behavioral disengagement, self-distraction, and substance use coping styles were also related to poorer mental health, whereas positive-reframing (only among the Hungarian and Turkish participants) and humor (only among the Norwegian participants) were related to better mental health among our sample in the context of COVID-19. The findings implied that death attitudes and coping styles may differ in their efficacy among the Hungarian, Norwegian, and Turkish participants. These differences were discussed in detail in the discussion part. During the pandemic, practitioners might pay closer attention to patients with higher escape acceptance death attitude and patients who use dysfunctional coping styles. Additionally, patients can be encouraged to use techniques involving positive reframing and humor coping styles.","Oker, Reinhardt, Schmelowszky","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.812720","20220224","COVID-19; coping styles; cross-cultural comparison; death attitudes; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27530,""
"Adolescents' Resilience During COVID-19 Pandemic and Its Mediating Role in the Association Between SEL Skills and Mental Health","The main purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of social and emotional learning (SEL) skills and resilience in explaining mental health in male and female adolescents, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three self-report questionnaires were administered to 778 participants aged between 11 and 16 years (mean age = 12.73 years; SD = 1.73) and recruited from 18 schools in Northern Italy. The SSIS-SEL<i>b</i>-S and the CD-RISC 10 assessed SEL and resilience skills respectively, while the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was used to measure mental health in terms of internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and prosocial behavior. We found that SEL and resilience skills were positively and significantly associated with each other, negatively associated with internalizing and externalizing problems, and positively related to prosocial behavior. Three linear regression analyses showed the significant role of resilience, age, and gender in explaining the variance of internalizing problems; the significant role of SEL skills, resilience, age, and gender in explaining the variance of externalizing problems; and the role of SEL skills, age, and gender in explaining prosocial behavior. Importantly, we found that resilience fully mediated the relationship between SEL skills and internalizing problems, partially mediated the relationship between SEL skills and externalizing problems and didn't mediate the relationship between SEL skills and prosocial behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the study as well as its practical implications.","Grazzani, Agliati, Cavioni, Conte, Gandellini, Lupica Spagnolo, Ornaghi, Rossi, Cefai, Bartolo, Camilleri, Oriordan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.801761","20220224","adolescents; externalizing behaviors; internalizing behaviors; mental health; prosocial behaviors; resilience; social-emotional learning","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27531,""
"Scaling Up Patient-Centered Psychological Treatments for Perinatal Depression in the Wake of a Global Pandemic","There is a call to action to reduce the public health burden of perinatal depression worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted significant gaps in perinatal mental health care, especially among women who identify as Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC). While psychotherapeutic (cognitive, behavioral and interpersonal) interventions are endorsed for perinatal mood disorders, barriers to access and uptake contribute to inequitable access to treatment at the population level. To effectively address these barriers and increase the scalability of psychotherapy among perinatal women, we suggest four pragmatic questions to be answered from a patient-centered lens; namely, ""who,"" ""what,"" ""how,"" and ""when."" Promising avenues include task-sharing among mental health non-specialists, an emphasis on culturally sensitive care, web-based delivery of psychotherapy with some caveats, and a lifespan approach to perinatal mental health. Innovative research efforts are seeking to validate these approaches in diverse contexts across North America and the UK, lending optimism toward scalable and long-term solutions for equitable perinatal mental health care.","Singla, Meltzer-Brody, Savel, Silver","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.826019","20220224","health equity; perinatal depression; psychotherapy; task sharing; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27532,""
"Social Media Efficacy in Crisis Management: Effectiveness of Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Manage COVID-19 Challenges","The new identified virus COVID-19 has become one of the most contagious diseases in human history. The ongoing coronavirus has created severe threats to global mental health, which have resulted in crisis management challenges and international concerns related to health issues. As of September 9, 2021, there were over 223.4 million patients with COVID-19, including 4.6 million deaths and over 200 million recovered patients reported worldwide, which has made the COVID-19 outbreak one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The aggressive public health implementations endorsed various precautionary safety and preventive strategies to suppress and minimize COVID-19 disease transmission. The second, third, and fourth waves of COVID-19 continue to pose global challenges to crisis management, as its evolution and implications are still unfolding. This study posits that examining the strategic ripostes and pandemic experiences sheds light on combatting this global emergency. This study recommends two model strategies that help reduce the adverse effects of the pandemic on the immune systems of the general population. This present paper recommends NPI interventions (non-pharmaceutical intervention) to combine various measures, such as the suppression strategy (lockdown and restrictions) and mitigation model to decrease the burden on health systems. The current COVID-19 health crisis has influenced all vital economic sectors and developed crisis management problems. The global supply of vaccines is still not sufficient to manage this global health emergency. In this crisis, NPIs are helpful to manage the spillover impacts of the pandemic. It articulates the prominence of resilience and economic and strategic agility to resume economic activities and resolve healthcare issues. This study primarily focuses on the role of social media to tackle challenges and crises posed by COVID-19 on economies, business activities, healthcare burdens, and government support for societies to resume businesses, and implications for global economic and healthcare provision disruptions. This study suggests that intervention strategies can control the rapid spread of COVID-19 with hands-on crisis management measures, and the healthcare system will resume normal conditions quickly. Global economies will revitalize scientific contributions and collaborations, including social science and business industries, through government support.","Zhou, Draghici, Abbas, Mubeen, Boatca, Salam","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.626134","20220224","COVID-19; crisis management; health related information; non-pharmaceutical interventions; social media use","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27533,""
"Type 1 diabetes and the challenges of emotional support in crisis situations: results from a randomized clinical trial of a multidisciplinary teleintervention","The association between type 1 diabetes and mental health disorders could be exacerbated in a stressful environment. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a teleguided intervention on emotional disorders in patients with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak. An open-label clinical trial was performed during the social distancing period in the COVID-19 outbreak in Brazil. Individuals with type 1 diabetes agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°18Ã‚Â years were randomized to receive a teleguided multidisciplinary intervention or the usual care plus an educational website access. The primary outcome was a positive screening for emotional disorders (Self Report Questionnaire 20) after a 16-week intervention. Secondary outcomes included evaluation of patients' perceptions of pandemic-related changes, diabetes-related emotional distress, eating disorders, and sleep disorders. Data were analyzed with the intent-to-treat principle. Fifty-eight individuals (mean age, 43.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°13.6Ã‚Â years) were included (intervention group, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29; control group, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°29). The primary outcome was not different between the groups. The intervention group felt more supported in their diabetes care during the social distancing period (82.8% vs. 48.3% in the control group, PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). Both groups reported a similar self-perceived worsening of physical activity habits and mental health during the outbreak. There was no benefit to using theÃ‚Â telehealth strategy proposed for emotional disorders in patients with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 outbreak. Further studies are needed to determine the impact on metabolic parameters and to understand why it is so difficult to emotionally support these patients.Trail Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04344210), 14/04/2020.","Alessi, Becker, Amaral, de Oliveira, Franco, Knijnik, Kobe, de Brito, de Carvalho, Telo, Schaan, Telo","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07005-w","20220224","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27534,""
"Increase in Mental Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic-the Role of Occupational and Financial Strains An Analysis of the German National Cohort (NAKO) Study","Numerous studies have reported an increase in mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the exact reasons for this development are not well understood. In this study we investigate whether pandemic-related occupational and financial changes (e.g., reduced working hours, working from home, financial losses) were associated with increased symptoms of depression and anxiety compared with the situation before the pandemic. We analyzed data from the German National Cohort (NAKO) Study. Between May and November 2020, 161 849 study participants answered questions on their mental state and social circumstances. Their responses were compared with data from the baseline survey before the pandemic (2014-2019). Linear fixed-effects models were used to determine whether individual changes in the severity of symptoms of depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) were associated with occupational/financial changes (controlling for various covariates). The prevalence of moderate or severe symptoms of depression and anxiety increased by 2.4% and 1.5%, respectively, during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preceding years. The mean severity of the symptoms rose slightly. A pronounced increase in symptoms was observed among those who became unemployed during the pandemic (+ 1.16 points on the depression scale, 95% confidence interval [0.91; 1.41], range 0-27). Increases were also seen for reduced working hours with no short-time allowance, increased working hours, working from home, insecurity regarding employment, and financial strain. The deterioration in mental health was largely statistically explained by the occupational and financial changes investigated in the model. Depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders increased slightly in the study population during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Occupational and financial difficulties were an essential contributory factor. These strains should be taken into account both in the care of individual patients and in the planning of targeted prevention measures.","Dragano, Reuter, Peters, Engels, Schmidt, Greiser, Bohn, Riedel-Heller, Karch, Mikolajczyk, Krause, Lang, Panreck, Rietschel, Brenner, Fischer, Franzke, Gastell, Holleczek, JÃƒÂ¶ckel, Kaaks, Keil, Kluttig, KuÃƒÅ¸, Legath, Leitzmann, Lieb, Meinke-Franze, Michels, Obi, Pischon, Feinkohl, Rospleszcz, Schikowski, Schulze, Stang, VÃƒÂ¶lzke, Willich, Wirkner, Zeeb, Ahrens, Berger","https://doi.org/10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0133","20220224","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27535,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Malaysian dental students' physical, mental, financial and academic concerns","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has gained worldwide attention and proved to hold an impact to humankind in all aspects of life. Dental students' performances may indirectly be affected following the preventive measures in containing the disease. This study aims to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on physical, mental, financial health and academic concern among dental students in Malaysia. The current research implemented a cross sectional study among dental students in Malaysia. Assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on dental education was done by the distribution of a set of online survey consisting of 28 questions to dental students (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°353) from public and private universities in Malaysia. The questionnaires include sociodemographic backgrounds and assessment on the mental health, financial health, physical health and academic concern. Kruskal Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to analyse the impact of COVID-19 to these 4 domains according to sociodemographic background. A total number of 353 respondents was recorded and 76.2% comprised of female. 59.7% were clinical students and 40.3% were preclinical students. Most of students were concerned about their own emotional health, financial concern, physical wellbeing, in which Year 3 students were found to be more concerned about their mental and financial health concern. COVID-19 pandemic had indeed significantly affected Malaysian dental students mainly due to fear of the quality of online learning and the amount of clinical skills acquired. Therefore, it is important to identify dental stressorsÃ‚Â and lessen the impact of COVID-19 to dental students.","Lestari, Yazid, Azhar, Ismail, Sukotjo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12903-022-02081-w","20220224","COVID-19; Dental education; Dentistry; Medicine; Mental health; Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27536,""
"Digital transformation in medical education: Factors that influence readiness","Digital transformation has become inseparable from education, and its implementation has broadly increased due to the increased adoption of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study evaluated the levels and influence of computer anxiety and digital readiness for academic engagement among undergraduate students. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 272 medical students enrolled in a medicine program. Two previously validated instruments were adopted. We examined the association between students' sociodemographic variables, internet use, and perceived academic performance during e-learning and their computer anxiety and digital readiness. The results show a significant effect of gender, age, and internet use on students' computer anxiety and digital readiness. Males' information-sharing behavior and skills outperformed those of females, and students' computer anxiety decreased with increasing age. In addition, the results indicate that the greater the students' internet use, the better their digital readiness for academic engagement. Furthermore, computer anxiety and digital readiness affect students' perceptions of their academic performance in e-learning. The rapid rate of technological advancements and the integration of e-learning into education means that careful attention must be paid to student characteristics as well as their skills. This will allow educators to create a successful, personalized learning framework.","Althubaiti, Tirksstani, Alsehaibany, Aljedani, Mutairii, Alghamdi","https://doi.org/10.1177/14604582221075554","20220224","Academic engagement; academic performance; computer anxiety; digital readiness; e-learning, medical students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27537,""

"Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM): A pilot randomized controlled trial of an App-based program for mothers of toddlers","Families have faced unprecedented challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to increased maternal mental health problems and barriers to accessing care. Innovative programs are needed to support both maternal mental health and parenting, and to buffer the long-term impacts of stress on young children. Using a patient-oriented approach, our research team co-developed and pilot tested an App-based psychoeducation and social-connection platform: Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health (BEAM). The co-development process involved a parent advisory board from conceptualization and design, through to direct participation in the program delivery. The BEAM program includes weekly videos and activities based on Unified Protocol therapy modules and emotion-focused parenting strategies, a weekly telehealth group review session, and access to a private online forum for support from other mothers and clinical coaches. A pilot randomized control trial was conducted across two provinces in Canada. 65 mothers of preschool children (aged 18-36 months old), with moderate-to-severe depression (Patient Health Questionaire-9=10), were allocated to either the 10-week BEAM intervention (n=33) or treatment as usual control (n=32) groups. Participants completed questions about feasibility and acceptability of the program and pre/post self-report measures of mental health, parenting, positive coping and child behavior outcomes. Engagement was relatively high at the beginning of the program, with 78.8% starting the BEAM App and 70.6% attending =1 telehealth session. Most respondents felt socially supported, satisfied with the App, and found it easy to use. Data were analysed using mixed models and an intention-to-treat approach. Pre-post results indicated interaction effects with greater reductions in overall mental health problems and specific anxiety and sleep symptoms among BEAM versus control participants, as well as time effects with reductions in depression symptoms across both groups. No significant treatment effects emerged for the other mental health symptoms, parenting problems, positive coping, or child behaviour outcomes. Descriptive data are included to highlight possible areas of promise for future large efficacy trials. Technological difficulties and other challenges that may have led to attrition and impacted outcomes are discussed. The BEAM program has promise as a novel, feasible and acceptable intervention for improving mental health among mothers of young children.","Anna MacKinnon et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/E0157-9A3-C42","20220222","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; digital health; emotion regulation; maternal mental health; randomized controlled trial; parenting","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-25","",27539,""
