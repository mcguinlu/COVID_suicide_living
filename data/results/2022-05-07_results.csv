"Educational  Alternation:  A  challenge  to  protect  the  health  and  life  of  the  school community; Alternancia Escolar: un reto para garantizar la salud y la vida de la comunidad educativa","La inesperada llegada de la pandemia, enfrentÃ³ a todo el mundo a cambios drÃ¡sticos en la forma de vida que se disfrutaba en Ã©pocas de normalidad, obligando a la poblaciÃ³n a diferentes tipos de confinamientos. Estos trajeron consigo el cierre de casi todos los sectores y en consecuencia la interrupciÃ³n de muchos servicios esenciales, como las intervenciones en el sector educativo. Muchas de estas intervenciones estaban dirigidas, ademÃ¡s de a la educaciÃ³n misma, a brindar protecciÃ³n a los escolares, detectar condiciones de riesgo de violencia intrafamiliar, maltrato y trabajo infantil, suministrar raciones alimenticias, vigilar el cumplimiento del esquema de vacunaciÃ³n y a evitar la deserciÃ³n escolar, entre otras.   Aunque los escolares no son el grupo mÃ¡s afectado por COVID-19, un reciente estudio de UNICEF realizado en 87 paÃ­ses revela que, en noviembre de 2020, los niÃ±os y los adolescentes representaron el 11% del total de infecciones1, mientras que, en Colombia, la proporciÃ³n de casos pediÃ¡tricos (menores de 18 aÃ±os) se estima entre 7-8% y representan el 0.025% del total de fallecimientos2.  Aunque se ha reportado que el riesgo de infecciÃ³n en escolares es menor que el del personal docente y administrativo en instituciones de educaciÃ³n, esta discrepancia pudiera estar sobreestimada debido a una menor probabilidad de detecciÃ³n considerando el curso predominantemente asintomÃ¡tico de la infecciÃ³n en niÃ±os. Sin embargo, COVID-19 puede ser una enfermedad severa en los menores, contribuyendo no solo al nÃºmero de ingresos a unidades de cuidados intensivo sino al de casos fatales3.   En tÃ©rminos de la transmisiÃ³n, un estudio conducido en poblaciÃ³n infantil evidenciÃ³ que esta ocurre con mayor frecuencia en el entorno familiar, relacionÃ¡ndose directamente con el estadio de enfermedad del caso Ã­ndice: comparados con casos asintomÃ¡ticos aquellos en etapa pre sintomÃ¡tica fueron responsables del doble de casos secundarios (1/3 versus 1/6)4. Esto indica que los niÃ±os infectados constituyen una fuente importante de contagio para sus pares, con evidencia de mayor transmisiÃ³n en el nivel de secundaria comparado con el de primaria5, asÃ­ como para los miembros del personal docente y administrativo de sus escuelas. Estos Ãºltimos, a su vez generarÃ­an nuevos casos de infecciÃ³n en la comunidad estudiantil y dada cuenta de su mayor movilidad, tambiÃ©n en la poblaciÃ³n general6.  La importancia que la socializaciÃ³n tiene en los procesos de enseÃ±anza-aprendizaje y en el desarrollo psicolÃ³gico de los niÃ±os, niÃ±as, adolescentes y jÃ³venes es ampliamente reconocida. AdemÃ¡s, es conocido el impacto beneficioso que tienen las actividades educativas en la salud fÃ­sica y mental y en general, en la probabilidad que nuestros niÃ±os alcancen todo su potencial y tengan una vida plena. En esta direcciÃ³n, y ajustÃ¡ndose a la coyuntura, el sector educativo ha tenido que instaurar nuevas estrategias, pasando a la modalidad virtual (asistida por las tecnologÃ­as de la informaciÃ³n y las comunicaciones Â­ TICs) y a diferentes modelos de alternancia escolar.  La alternancia se ofrece en diferentes modalidades como la hÃ­brida, en la que es posible que un grupo de estudiantes reciban de manera presencial la clase y el resto lo hagan de manera virtual en forma sincrÃ³nica, con opciones de participaciÃ³n en ambos espacios. Otra estrategia es el desarrollo de la clase presencial y de manera asincrÃ³nica el desarrollo de actividades virtuales en casa, es decir, con grupos de estudiantes que tendrÃ¡n asistencia a la instituciÃ³n y trabajo virtual o so-lamente asistencia a la instituciÃ³n. Las instituciones que no acojan la alternancia continuarÃ¡n con su oferta pedagÃ³gica en la modalidad virtual. Cualquiera de los modelos de alternancia que las instituciones adopten trae consigo la presencialidad y, por lo tanto, la necesidad de realizar acciones para la disminuciÃ³n del riesgo, la identificaciÃ³n de casos (sintomÃ¡ticos y asintomÃ¡ticos) y sus contactos y el seguimiento y aislamiento, cuando ello se requiera.  Nadie niega la importancia del regreso a la escuela, pero Ã©sta debe hacerse en condiciones seguras que garanticen la protecciÃ³n de la salud y la vida de escolares, maestros, personal administrativo y de apoyo y de sus familias. Para lograr este objetivo se requiere adherencia y adaptaciÃ³n en cada instituciÃ³n educativa de los protocolos de bioseguridad emanados de los ministerios de educaciÃ³n y salud.  AdemÃ¡s, se requiere tener en cuenta la situaciÃ³n epidemiolÃ³gica actual del municipio o Ã¡rea metropolitana y de la evoluciÃ³n de la epidemia en la poblaciÃ³n local y la comunidad educativa institucional. Esto Ãºltimo, el conocimiento cabal de la situaciÃ³n epidemiolÃ³gica local e institucional es crucial para poder decidir responsablemente cuando se abre o se cierra una instituciÃ³n educativa, a fin de preservar la salud, el bienestar y la vida de sus integrantes.  En particular, al momento de tomar estas decisiones, es esencial tener en cuenta los siguientes aspectos:  La situaciÃ³n de la transmisiÃ³n y la velocidad de contagio del SARS-CoV-2 en la localidad y   cÃ³mo esto afectarÃ¡ el entorno educativo. El nivel de capacidad de los servicios de salud y especialmente las EPS para detectar y aislar casos sintomÃ¡ticos y asintomÃ¡ticos; detectar brotes o conglomerados de casos; identificar y seguir contactos de los casos; y establecer cercos epidemiolÃ³gicos para detener la transmisiÃ³n de la enfermedad dentro de la instituciÃ³n educativa. En quÃ© medida la infecciÃ³n y enfermedad en familiares de los estudiantes, profesores y otro personal de la instituciÃ³n, constituye un factor de riesgo para los niÃ±os y viceversa. Dada la dinÃ¡mica de la transmisiÃ³n, los protocolos de bioseguridad por sÃ­ mismos, no garantizan la reducciÃ³n del riesgo, si no se acompaÃ±an del cumplimiento estricto de los mismos, del acondicionamiento de las instituciones educativas para garantizar ambientes seguros, y de un anÃ¡lisis tÃ©cnico, permanente y veraz de las condiciones de la pandemia en la localidad. Garantizar la ventilaciÃ³n adecuada y los recambios de aire, de los diferentes espacios de las instituciones educativas especialmente en las Ã¡reas cerradas, es un factor de especial importancia para disminuir la transmisiÃ³n del virus. Por lo tanto, este aspecto es un asunto clave en la adecuaciÃ³n de las instituciones educativas. La decisiÃ³n  de abrir una instituciÃ³n de educaciÃ³n, debe estar precedida de un trabajo conjunto entre los  escolares, los padres, los maestros, el personal directivo, y el personal de salud, con el fin de fijar los lineamientos bÃ¡sicos de las decisiones y acciones tanto en los asuntos de salud, como de protecciÃ³n de los escolares y del personal y sus familias, la coordinaciÃ³n con las entidades de salud y la anticipaciÃ³n de la mayorÃ­a de las situaciones que puedan derivarse de los procesos de apertura. La instituciÃ³n educativa debe definir, con el apoyo del sector salud, los indicadores que les permitan decidir en quÃ© momento la instituciÃ³n debe cerrarse, bien sea de manera parcial o total, dada la existencia de casos en una burbuja (grupos estables de convivencia) o en varias burbujas.  AdemÃ¡s de los aspectos relacionados con minimizar el riesgo y disminuir la transmisiÃ³n, en el proceso de apertura deben contemplarse otros aspectos tales como: garantizar el acceso a la educaciÃ³n a distancia a todos los escolares de las poblaciones distantes o rurales, marginadas, de escasos recursos, con discapacidad y cuyos familiares pertenecen a grupos de alto riesgo. Garantizar mecanismos pedagÃ³gicos que les permitan a los escolares, superar la brecha en que pudieron haber caÃ­do, por las dificultades de acceso a la educaciÃ³n virtual. Proveer la asistencia en salud y nutriciÃ³n a los escolares, asÃ­ como la atenciÃ³n a las niÃ±as y adolescentes para la prevenciÃ³n del embarazo, el acoso y el abuso sexual. Ante la situaciÃ³n tan cambiante de la pandemia, es necesario tomar las decisiones de la apertura de las instituciones, en medio de gran incertidumbre. Son muchos los retos que el sector educativo tiene que superar. Pero en la planeaciÃ³n y toma de decisiones, como bien lo enuncia la UNICEF, ""la respuesta debe servir de catalizador para mejorar los resultados del aprendizaje, hacer mÃ¡s equitativo el acceso a la enseÃ±anza y fortalecer la protecciÃ³n, la salud y la seguridad de los niÃ±os""1.  En consecuencia, si bien es prioritario el regreso a la presencialidad especialmente en los niveles de educaciÃ³n bÃ¡sica, deberÃ¡n primar el principio de la protecciÃ³n y bienestar de los niÃ±os y los principios Ã©ticos, por encima de cualquier interÃ©s polÃ­tico o econÃ³mico, del ejercicio de autoridad, o de una falsa sensaciÃ³n de seguridad.  Conflicto de intereses: Los autores declaran no tener conflicto de intereses.; The  unexpected  arrival  of  the  pandemic  brought  everyone  to  face  drastic  changes  in  the  way  people  used  to  live  in  normal  times,   forcing   them   to   experience   different   types   of   home   confinement.  These  resulted  in  the  closure  of  almost  all  sectors  and,  consequently,  the  disruption  of  many  essential  services,  such  as  educational  interventions.  Many  of  these  interventions  were  aimed,  apart  from  education  itself,  at  providing  protection  to schoolchildren, detecting risk conditions of domestic violence, child  abuse  and  child  labor,  providing  school  meals,  monitoring  compliance  with  immunization  programs  and  preventing  school  dropout, among others.Although  schoolchildren  are  not  the  group  most  affected  by  COVID-19, a recent UNICEF study conducted in 87 countries found that  in  November  2020,  children  and  adolescents  accounted  for  11%  of  reported  COVID-19  infections1,  while  in  Colombia  the  number of pediatric COVID-19 cases (patients aged < 18 years) is estimated at 7-8% representing 0.025% of deaths2.While the risk of infection in schoolchildren has been reported to be lower than that of teaching and administrative staff in schools, this difference may be overestimated due to a lower probability of detection considering the predominantly asymptomatic course of infection in children. However, COVID-19 can be a severe disease in young people, contributing not only to the number of admissions to intensive care units but also to the number of deaths3.As  for  COVID-19  transmission,  a  study  conducted  with  children  showed that it occurs more frequently in the home environment, which  is  directly  related  to  the  stage  of  disease  of  the  index  case  (that  is,  compared  to  asymptomatic  cases,  those  in  the  pre- 2Revista Cuidarte mayo - agosto 2021;12(2): e2244http://dx.doi.org/10.15649/cuidarte.2244symptomatic   stage   were   responsible   for   twice   as   many secondary cases as index case (1/3 versus 1/6)4. This  means  that  infected  children  are  an  important  source of infection for their peers, suggesting greater transmission   rates   in   high   school   compared   to   elementary school5, as well as in teachers and school administrative  staff.  The  latter  would  in  turn  lead  to  new  cases  of  infection  in  the  school  community  and,  given  their  greater  mobility,  also  in  the  general population6.The   importance   of   socialization   in   teaching-learning   processes   and   the   psychological   development  of  children,  adolescents  and  young  people  is  widely  recognized.  Furthermore,  the positive impacts that educational activities have on physical and mental health and more generally,  the  chances  that  our  children  will  reach  their  full  potential  and  have  a  fulfilling  life  are  well-known.  In  this  regard,  and  in  response  to  the  current  situation,  the  education  sector  needed  to  implement  new  strategies,  switching  to  online  education  (assisted  by  information  and communications technology (ICT)) and different models of educational alternation.Educational  alternation  can  be  offered  in  different  modes  such  as  hybrid  learning,  in  which  a  group  of  students  has  in-person  classes  and  the  rest  of  the  group  receive  online  instruction  in  a  synchronous  way,  providing  options  for  participation  in  both  spaces.  Another  strategy  combines  in-person  instruction  and  asynchronous  online  activities  at  home,  i.e.,  a  group  of  students will have in-person and remote instruction and another one will only have in-person instruction.  Schools  that  do  not  implement  any  educational  alternation  model  will  continue  with  their  educational  online  offer.  Every  alternation  model  implemented  by  schools  entails  face-to-face instruction and, therefore, the need to take actions for risk reduction, identification of  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  cases,  contact  tracing,  subsequent  follow  up  and  self-isolation, when required.No one denies the importance of returning to school. However, this should be safely done to protect  the  health  and  life  of  students,  teachers,  school  administrative  and  support  staff  and  their  families.  To  this  end,  each  school  is  required  to  adhere  to  and  adapt  biosafety  protocols  issued  by  the  ministries  of  education  and  health.  In  addition,  the  current  epidemiological  situation of each municipality or urban area as well as the course of the outbreak in the local population  and  school  community  need  to  be  taken  into  account.  A  complete  understanding  of  the  local  and  institutional  epidemiological  situation  is  crucial  to  make  responsible  decisions  when  reopening  or  closing  schools  to  protect  the  health,  wellbeing  and  life of the school community.The following aspects are essential to consider when making these decisions:-Transmission  and  speed  rates  of  SARS-CoV-2  infection  in  the  local  population  and  their  impact on the educational environment.-Health care services capacity, especially in Health Promotion Agencies (EPSs in Spanish), to detect  and  isolate  symptomatic  and  asymptomatic  cases;  detect  outbreaks  or  clusters  of  This means that infected children are an important source of infection for their peers, suggesting greater transmission rates in high school compared to elementary school5, as well as in teachers and school administrative staff.  A complete understanding of the local and institutional epidemiological situation is crucial to make responsible decisions when reopening or closing schools to protect the health, wellbeing and life of the school community. 3Revista Cuidarte mayo - agosto 2021;12(2): e2244http://dx.doi.org/10.15649/cuidarte.2244COVID-19 cases; identify and trace contacts and implement epidemiological fences to stop disease transmission within the school community.-The  degree  to  which  coronavirus  infection  and  disease  in  students,  teachers  and  other  school staff 's relatives can become a risk factor for children and vice versa.-Considering  transmission  dynamics  of  COVID-19,  biosafety  protocols  alone  do  not  ensure  risk  reduction  unless  supported  by  strict  compliance,  school  preparation  to  ensure  safe  environments  and  technical,  ongoing  and  accurate  analysis  of  the  pandemic  situation  in  the local territory.-Proper  ventilation  and  air  circulation  of  school  areas,  especially  indoors,  is  a  key  factor  in  reducing virus transmission. Therefore, it is a key issue to consider in school preparation.-The decision to reopen a school should be preceded by joint efforts among students, parents, teachers, school board and healthcare personnel to define the basic guidelines for decision making  and  management  actions  on  healthcare  issues,  protection  of  students,  staff  and  their families, as well as coordination with healthcare agencies and anticipation of potential challenges that may arise from school reopening.-Supported by the healthcare sector, schools need to define the indicators that will help them decide when the school should be closed, either partially or totally, given the existence of cases in one bubble (stable coexistence groups) or several bubbles.-In addition to risk and transmission reduction, aspects such as access to distance learning to all schoolchildren from remote, rural, marginalized, low-income, disabled populations and those having relatives at higher risk for COVID-19 should be considered in school reopenings.-Teaching  mechanisms  should  be  in  place  to  overcome  any  gap  that  schoolchildren  may  have fallen into due to difficulties in accessing online learning.-Implementation  of  health  and  nutrition  assistance  for  children,  in  addition  to  health  care  services for girls and adolescents to prevent pregnancy, harassment and sexual abuse.Faced with the rapidly changing situation of the pandemic, it is necessary to make decisions on school  reopening  in  the  midst  of  great  uncertainty.  Although  there  are  many  challenges  that  the education sector needs to overcome, during planning and decision making ""the response should serve as a catalyst to improve learning outcomes, increase equitable access to education and strengthen the protection, health and safety of children""1 as stated by UNICEF. Consequently, while the return to in-person education is a priority, especially for basic education, the principle of protection and wellbeing of children and ethical principles should take precedence over any political or economic interest, the exercise of authority or a false sense of security.Conflict of interest statement: The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.; A inesperada chegada da pandemia, enfrentou a todos mudanÃ§as drÃ¡sticas  na  forma  de  vida  que  se  desfrutava  em  Ã©pocas  de  normalidade,   obrigando   a   populaÃ§Ã£o   a   diferentes   tipos   de   confinamento. Estes levaram ao encerramento de quase todos os setores  e,  consequentemente,  Ã   interrupÃ§Ã£o  de  muitos  serviÃ§os  essenciais,  como  as  intervenÃ§Ãµes  no  sector  da  educaÃ§Ã£o.  Muitas  destas  intervenÃ§Ãµes  eram  dirigidas,  alÃ©m  da  prÃ³pria  educaÃ§Ã£o,  a  proporcionar  proteÃ§Ã£o  aos  alunos,  identificar  as  condiÃ§Ãµes  de  risco   de   violÃªncia   domÃ©stica,   maus-tratos   e   trabalho   infantil,   fornecer porÃ§Ãµes alimentares, controlar o cumprimento do plano de vacinaÃ§Ã£o e evitar a deserÃ§Ã£o escolar, entre outras.  Embora os alunos nÃ£o sejam o grupo mais afetado pela COVID-19, um estudo recente da UNICEF realizado em 87 paÃ­ses revela que, em  Novembro  de  2020,  crianÃ§as  e  adolescentes  representaram  11% do total de infeÃ§Ã£o1, enquanto, na ColÃ´mbia, a proporÃ§Ã£o de casos  pediÃ¡tricos  (menores  de  18  anos)  Ã©  estimada  entre  7-8%  e  representam 0.025% do total de mortes2. Embora  se  tenha  relatado  que  o  risco  de  infecÃ§Ã£o  em  escolas  Ã©  menor do que o do pessoal docente e administrativo em instituiÃ§Ãµes de educaÃ§Ã£o 3, esta discrepÃ¢ncia pode ser sobrestimada devido a uma  menor  probabilidade  de  detecÃ§Ã£o,  tendo  em  conta  o  curso  predominantemente   assintomÃ¡tico   da   infecÃ§Ã£o   em   crianÃ§as.   No  entanto,  COVID-19  pode  ser  uma  doenÃ§a  grave  em  crianÃ§as,  contribuindo nÃ£o sÃ³ para o nÃºmero de entradas nas unidades de cuidados intensivos, mas tambÃ©m para o nÃºmero de casos fatais3.  Em  termos  de  transmissÃ£o,  um  estudo  conduzido  em  populaÃ§Ã£o  infantil   evidenciou   que   a   transmissÃ£o   acontece   com   maior    2Revista Cuidarte mayo - agosto 2021;12(2): e2244http://dx.doi.org/10.15649/cuidarte.2244frequÃªncia     no     ambiente     familiar,     relacionadas     diretamente com o estÃ¡dio da doenÃ§a do caso Ã­ndice: comparados  com  casos  assintomÃ¡ticos  aqueles  em  etapa prÃ©-sintomÃ¡tica foram responsÃ¡veis pelo dobro de  casos  secundÃ¡rios  (1/3  versus  1/6)4.  Isto  indica  que   as   crianÃ§as   infectadas   constituem   uma   fonte   importante   de   contÃ¡gio   para   os   seus   pares,   com   evidÃªncia  de  maior  transmissÃ£o  no  nÃ­vel  secundÃ¡rio  comparado  com  o  primÃ¡rio5,  como  para  os  membros  do  pessoal  docente  e  administrativo  das suas escolas. Estes Ãºltimos, por sua vez, gerariam novos casos de infecÃ§Ã£o na comunidade estudantil e dada a sua maior movimentaÃ§Ã£o, tambÃ©m na populaÃ§Ã£o geral6. A   importÃ¢ncia   que   a   socializaÃ§Ã£o   tem   nos   processos   de   ensino-aprendizagem   e   no   desenvolvimento  psicolÃ³gico  dos  meninos,  meninas,  adolescentes  e  jovens  Ã©  amplamente  reconhecida. AlÃ©m disso, Ã© conhecido o impacto benÃ©fico das atividades educativas na saÃºde fÃ­sica e mental e em geral, na probabilidade que nossas crianÃ§as alcanÃ§arem todo o seu potencial e terem uma vida plena. Neste sentido, e adaptando-se Ã  conjuntura, o setor da educaÃ§Ã£o teve que instaurar novas estratÃ©gias, passando Ã  modalidade virtual (assistida pelas tecnologias da informaÃ§Ã£o e das comunicaÃ§Ãµes - TICs) e a diferentes modelos de alternÃ¢ncia escolar. A  alternÃ¢ncia  Ã©  oferecida  em  diferentes  modalidades,  como  a  hÃ­brida,  na  qual  um  grupo  de  estudantes  pode  receber  a  aula  em  forma  presencial  e  os  restantes  podem  fazÃª-lo  de  forma  virtual  e  sincronizada,  com  opÃ§Ãµes  de  participaÃ§Ã£o  em  ambos  os  espaÃ§os.  Outra  estratÃ©gia  Ã©   o   desenvolvimento   da   classe   presencial   e   de   maneira   assÃ­ncrona   o   desenvolvimento   de  atividades  virtuais  em  casa,  ou  seja,  com  grupos  de  estudantes  que  terÃ£o  assistÃªncia  Ã   instituiÃ§Ã£o e trabalho virtual ou apenas assistÃªncia Ã  instituiÃ§Ã£o. As instituiÃ§Ãµes que nÃ£o acolham a  alternÃ¢ncia  continuarÃ£o  com  sua  oferta  pedagÃ³gica  na  modalidade  virtual.  Qualquer  dos  modelos de alternÃ¢ncia que as instituiÃ§Ãµes adotem traz consigo a presencialidade e, portanto, a necessidade de realizar aÃ§Ãµes para a diminuiÃ§Ã£o do risco, a identificaÃ§Ã£o de casos (sintomÃ¡ticos e  assintomÃ¡ticos)  e  respectivos  contatos,  bem  como  a  monitorizaÃ§Ã£o  e  o  isolamento,  se  necessÃ¡rio.NinguÃ©m nega a importÃ¢ncia do regresso Ã  escola, mas isso deve ser feito em condiÃ§Ãµes seguras que garantam a proteÃ§Ã£o da saÃºde e da vida de alunos, professores, pessoal administrativo e de apoio e das suas famÃ­lias. Para alcanÃ§ar este objetivo, requer-se adesÃ£o e adaptaÃ§Ã£o em cada instituiÃ§Ã£o  educativa  dos  protocolos  de  biosseguranÃ§a  emitidos  dos  ministÃ©rios  de  educaÃ§Ã£o  e  saÃºde.  AlÃ©m  disso,  Ã©  necessÃ¡rio  ter  em  conta  a  situaÃ§Ã£o  epidemiolÃ³gica  atual  do  municÃ­pio  ou  Ã¡rea  metropolitana  e  a  evoluÃ§Ã£o  da  epidemia  na   populaÃ§Ã£o   local   e   na   comunidade   educativa   institucional.  Este  Ãºltimo,  o  pleno  conhecimento  da  situaÃ§Ã£o epidemiolÃ³gica local e institucional Ã© crucial para poder decidir responsavelmente quando se abre ou fecha uma instituiÃ§Ã£o educativa, a fim de preservar a saÃºde, o bem-estar e a vida de seus integrantes. Em  particular,  no  momento  das  tomadas  de  decisÃµes,  Ã©  essencial  ter  em  conta  os  seguintes  aspectos: Isto indica que as crianÃ§as infectadas constituem uma fonte importante de contÃ¡gio para os seus pares, com evidÃªncia de maior transmissÃ£o no nÃ­vel secundÃ¡rio comparado com o primÃ¡rio5, como para os membros do pessoal docente e administrativo das suas escolas., o pleno conhecimento da situaÃ§Ã£o epidemiolÃ³gica local e institucional Ã© crucial para poder decidir responsavelmente quando se abre ou fecha uma instituiÃ§Ã£o educativa, a fim de preservar a saÃºde, o bem-estar e a vida de seus integrantes.  3Revista Cuidarte mayo - agosto 2021;12(2): e2244http://dx.doi.org/10.15649/cuidarte.2244- A situaÃ§Ã£o da transmissÃ£o e a velocidade de contÃ¡gio do SARS-CoV-2 na localidade e como isso afetarÃ¡ o ambiente educacional- O nÃ­vel de capacidade dos serviÃ§os de saÃºde e, em especial, das EPS (entidades promotoras de  saÃºde)  para  detectar  e  isolar  casos  sintomÃ¡ticos  e  assintomÃ¡ticos;  detectar  surtos  ou  conglomerados  de  casos;  identificar  e  acompanhar  os  contatos  dos  casos  e  estabelecer  barreiras  epidemiolÃ³gicas  para  impedir  a  transmissÃ£o  da  doenÃ§a  dentro  da  instituiÃ§Ã£o  de  ensino.  - Em  que  medida  a  infecÃ§Ã£o  e  a  doenÃ§a  nos  familiares  dos  estudantes,  professores  e  outro  pessoal da instituiÃ§Ã£o constituem um fator de risco para as crianÃ§as e vice-versa.- Dada a dinÃ¢mica da transmissÃ£o, os protocolos de biosseguranÃ§a, por si sÃ³, nÃ£o garantem a reduÃ§Ã£o do risco, se nÃ£o forem acompanhados do cumprimento estrito dos mesmos, do acondicionamento das instituiÃ§Ãµes educativas para garantir ambientes seguros, e de uma anÃ¡lise tÃ©cnica, permanente e verdadeira das condiÃ§Ãµes da pandemia na localidade.- Garantir a ventilaÃ§Ã£o adequada e a mudanÃ§a de ar dos diferentes espaÃ§os das instituiÃ§Ãµes educativas,  especialmente  nas  Ã¡reas  fechadas,  Ã©  um  fator  de  especial  importÃ¢ncia  para  diminuir a transmissÃ£o do vÃ­rus. Portanto, este aspecto Ã© uma questÃ£o chave na adequaÃ§Ã£o das instituiÃ§Ãµes de ensino. - A decisÃ£o de abrir uma instituiÃ§Ã£o de educaÃ§Ã£o deve ser precedida de um trabalho conjunto entre os escolares, os pais, os professores, o pessoal dirigente, e o pessoal de saÃºde, a fim de estabelecer as orientaÃ§Ãµes bÃ¡sicas das decisÃµes e aÃ§Ãµes, tanto em matÃ©ria de saÃºde como de  proteÃ§Ã£o  dos  estudantes  e  do  pessoal  e  suas  respectivas  famÃ­lias,  a  coordenaÃ§Ã£o  com  as instituiÃ§Ãµes de saÃºde e a antecipaÃ§Ã£o da maioria das situaÃ§Ãµes que possam resultar dos processos de abertura. - A  instituiÃ§Ã£o  educativa  deve  definir,  com  o  apoio  do  sector  da  saÃºde,  os  indicadores  que  lhes  permitam  decidir  em  que  momento  a  instituiÃ§Ã£o  deve  ser  encerrada,  seja  de  forma  parcial ou total, dada a existÃªncia de casos numa bolha (grupos estÃ¡veis de convivÃªncia) ou em vÃ¡rias bolhas.  - AlÃ©m dos aspectos relacionados com minimizar o risco e diminuir a transmissÃ£o, O processo de  abertura  deve  contemplar  outros  aspectos,  tais  como:  garantir  o  acesso  Ã   educaÃ§Ã£o  Ã   distÃ¢ncia a todos os alunos das populaÃ§Ãµes distantes ou rurais, marginalizadas, de escassos recursos, com deficiÃªncia e cujos familiares pertencem a grupos de alto risco.- Garantir  mecanismos  pedagÃ³gicos  que  permitam  aos  alunos,  superar  a  brecha  em  que  podem ter caÃ­do, pelas dificuldades de acesso Ã  educaÃ§Ã£o virtual. - Fornecer cuidados de saÃºde e nutriÃ§Ã£o Ã s crianÃ§as em idade escolar, bem como de cuidados Ã s meninas e adolescentes para a prevenÃ§Ã£o da gravidez e do assÃ©dio sexual.Perante  a  situaÃ§Ã£o  tÃ£o  variÃ¡vel  da  pandemia,  Ã©  necessÃ¡rio  tomar  as  decisÃµes  de  abertura  das  instituiÃ§Ãµes, no meio de grande incerteza.

"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF CONFINEMENT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF COVID-19 IN A SPANISH SAMPLE","Se analizan las diferencias relacionadas con la edad en el impacto psicolÃ³gico del confinamiento a consecuencia de la Covid-19 en una muestra espaÃ±ola. Se realizÃ³ un estudio longitudinal (N= 1.041) mediante una encuesta online con dos mediciones: a las dos y cinco semanas de la declaraciÃ³n del estado de alarma en EspaÃ±a. Se evaluaron mediante cuestionarios de detecciÃ³n los sÃ­ntomas de trastorno de estrÃ©s postraumÃ¡tico (TEPT), ansiedad y depresiÃ³n, bienestar espiritual y soledad percibida. Se calcularon las medias y sus intervalos de confianza (95%) para todas las variables del estudio, para los tres grupos de edad: 18-30, 31-59, 60-80. Para cada variable se calcularon modelos lineales mixtos con pendientes aleatorias (tiempo anidado a los sujetos). El impacto psicolÃ³gico persiste a lo largo del tiempo, aumentando en algunas de las variables. El grupo de mayor edad muestra menor impacto y mayor bienestar. Presentan menos sÃ­ntomas de depresiÃ³n, ansiedad y TEPT y menos soledad. Estos resultados pueden explicarse por la mayor resiliencia de este grupo para recuperarse de situaciones adversas, y el mayor nÃºmero de estrategias de afrontamiento.Alternate :This research aims to analyze age-related differences in the psychological impact of the Covid-19 confinement situation in a Spanish sample. A longitudinal study (N= 1,041) was conducted through an online survey with two measurements: at two and five weeks after the declaration of the alarm state in Spain. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depressive symptoms, spiritual well-being and perceived loneliness were evaluated by screening tests. Means and their confidence intervals (95%) were calculated for all variables in the study, for the three age groups: 18-30, 31-59, 60-80. Linear mixed models with random slopes (Time nested to Subjects) were calculated for each variable. The results indicate that the psychological impact caused by the pandemic persists over time, and even increases in some of the variables studied. The older age group (60-80 years) shows the least impact and the greatest well-being. They presented less depressive, anxious and PTSD symptoms and less loneliness. These results may be explained by the greater resilience of this group to recover from adverse situations, in addition to having a greater number of coping strategies.","AusÃ­n, Berta, GonzÃ¡lez-Sanguino, Clara, Castellanos, Miguel Ãngel, Saiz, JesÃºs, MuÃ±oz, Manuel","https://doi.org/10.51668/bp.8322105n","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: PsicologÃ­a Conductual; 30(1):93-107, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31041,""

"The effects on mental health of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and metaanalysis","Background & Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has widely spread worldwide, and caused mental health problems for healthcare professionals, especially affecting the frontline nurses of the crisis. There is an immediate requirement to determine the frequency of anxiety, insomnia, and many other negative emotions in the staff to allow efficient measures to be taken. We aimed to analyze and document the existing evidence on the prevalence of mental health issues among nurses during the COVID-19. Methodology: A literature search was conducted through e-databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science up to December 2020. The search procedure based on using key words for ""nurses"", ""mental health"", and ""COVID-19 pandemic"". Results: A total of 30 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. There were 57555 samples in total in the studies. According to the random effects model, it was found that the overall effect size of the pandemic on the mental health of nurses caring for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 was statistically significant with a value of 1,964 (G.A;1,384-2,787;p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Serious symptoms of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression have emerged in frontline nurses dealing with COVID-19. Policymakers and managers need to take efficient measures for nurses to preserve their mental health status during COVID-19.

"Depression, anxiety and stress among healthcare workers in COVID-19 ICUs","Background & Objective: In most of the countries, the intensive care, airway management, and emergency resuscitation teams are largely constituted of the anesthetists, laying a great deal of physical, mental, and emotional pressure on them. In the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the anesthetists have been on the fore-front. We compared the level of anxiety, depression, and stress among healthcare workers (HCWs) of COVID-19 ICU (CICUs) and non- COVID ICUs (NCICUs) in the tertiary care hospitals of south Punjab. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional study was conducted after ethical approval from the institutional review board, and completed from December 10, 2020 to January 20, 2021, through Google forms by generating online structured questionnaires i.e. DASS-21 and GHQ-12. Our target population was HCWs of Anesthesia & Critical care of all the public sector tertiary care hospitals of South Punjab. A total of 100 participants has filled the self-reported questionnaire. After sorting the data, we divided the participants into two groups;CICU and NCICU groups. Results: Out of 100 participants, 31% were in the COVID ICU group and 69% in the NCICU group. Females were 54% of the total. 55% of the participants were below 30 y of age, 77% were married, and 48% were post-graduates. Overall 50% of HCWs had a probable psychological illness, while 25% had anxiety, 21% depression and 12% had stress. Anxiety, depression, and stress were more in COVID ICU group as compared to the non-COVID group [(35% vs. 20%), (32% vs. 16%) and (31% vs. 3%) respectively]. Conclusion: Coronavirus pandemic has affected the mental health of healthcare workers. Those working in COVID ICUs are more prone to develop psychological distress than non-COVID ICU healthcare workers.

"Linking COVID-19 with Suicide: Suggestions for Future Research","COVID-19 has impacted the world socio-economically. Unemployment, poverty, social stigma, social isolation, domestic violence and mental illnesses are the notable social issues related to COVID-19 pandemic. Framed under a review based approach, the current study searches for the link between COVID-19 pandemic and an increased vulnerability to suicide across the globe. Linking the current situation with researched determinants of suicide shows that COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating various socio-economic and psychological causes of suicide. In near future or even during the pandemic, suicide will be a key challenge for the public health sector across the globe.

"COVID-19 and transport A review of factors of relevance to the design of measures and their effects worldwide","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the introduction of transport-related policy measures worldwide. In this paper, we review the literature on factors that are important for the design of those measures, and their effects on safety, physical and mental health, economy and environment. We conclude that factors underlying the introduction of transport related measures are related to the broader discussion on COVID-19 measures (e.g. on social distancing). This makes it impossible to determine the independent influence of determinants aimed at transport on the effects (virus spread, economy, well-being). Furthermore, the effects of measures appear to differ strongly between countries. Important determinants for these effects are (1) socio-economic factors, (2) cultural factors, (3) political factors and (4) individual factors. In addition, the extent to which people can work at home appears to be very important for the introduction and effectiveness of COVID-19 measures. In the category of 'cultural factors', the degree to which people have a 'sense of civic responsibility' and trust in the government and institutions plays a major role in the compliance with advice and coercive measures. Furthermore, experiences with previous viruses appear to have made a positive contribution to COVID-19 policies that are successful at containing the virus. Finally, individual factors play a role in the compliance with COVID-19 measures. For example, a pro-social attitude is associated with better compliance. And: if people rate the effectiveness of such measures higher, they are more likely to act on them. The paper also provides recommendations for policy and further research.","Shortall, R.; Mouter, N.; van Wee, B.","https://doi.org/10.18757/ejtir.2022.22.1.5597","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: European Journal of Transport and Infrastructure Research; 22(1):118-130, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31047,""
"Vitamin B6 Antidepressant Effects Are Comparable to Common Antidepressant Drugs in Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin Induced Depression Model in Mice","Objective: Bacillus-Calmette-Guerin (BCG) inoculation in mice produces an acute period of illness followed by a chronic depressive-like behavior period that lasts for few weeks. The aim was to evaluate vitamin B6 antidepressant effect in comparison with common antidepressants. Method: BCG (0.2 ml/mouse) single dose was intraperitoneally inoculated in male mice. Vitamin B6 (100 mg/kg), fluoxetine, imipramine, or venlafaxine (10 mg/kg each) were intraperitoneally injected for 14 consecutive days following BCG administration. Illness was evaluated following inoculation and depressive-like behaviors were assessed on days 7 and 14. Results: Illness was induced by BCG since mice lost weight and locomotor activity was reduced. Illness was prevented by vitamin B6 similar to antidepressant drugs. Despair was measured by immobility time during the forced swim test and BCG increased it compared to control (193 Â± 3s vs 151 Â± 7s, P &lt; 0.01) on day 7, and (200 Â± 5s vs 147 Â± 6s, P &lt; 0.001) on day 14. Vitamin B6, like antidepressants, reduced despair. BCG clearly induced anhedonia evaluated by sucrose preference test (47.5%), and it was soothed by B6 and the antidepressants. Novelty-suppressed feeding test evaluated long term depressive behavior after 14 days. BCG increased the latency to first feeding (222 Â± 41s vs control 87 Â± 2.6s, P &lt; 0.001) and reduced food consumption per body weight (13 Â± 1 mg/g vs control 19 Â± 2 mg/g, P &lt; 0.001) while B6 like antidepressants reduced latency and improved food consumption. Conclusion: Vitamin B6 efficiently prevented BCG sickness and depression that was comparable to common antidepressant drugs. Therefore, B6 supplement for preventing depression in high-risk individuals is suggested for further clinical research.","Mesripour, Azadeh, Golchin, Shirin","https://doi.org/10.18502/ijps.v17i2.8911","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Iranian Journal of Psychiatry; 17(2):208-216, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31048,""
"Resilience and coping as moderators of stress-related growth in Asians and AAPIs during COVID-19","This exploratory study examined the extent to which coping, resilience, experiences of subtle and blatant racism, and ethnic identity predicted stress-related growth in a national convenience sample of Asians and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs;N = 326) who experienced COVID-19-related racial discrimination. Our analysis indicated participants with higher levels of coping, resilience, experiences of subtle and blatant racism, and ethnic identity were significantly more likely to cultivate higher levels of stress-related growth. Coping strategies such as self-blame, religion, humor, venting, substance use, denial, and behavioral disengagement significantly moderated the relationship between experiences of racism and stress-related growth. Notably, participants in the study who used mental health services following COVID-19 reported significantly higher levels of racial discrimination, resilience, coping, and stress-related growth compared to Asians and AAPIs who did not use professional mental health services. Mental health professionals are called to utilize culturally sensitive treatment modalities and challenge traditional Western notions that frame coping responses from an individualistic worldview.

"Do patients with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder experience more somatosensorial amplification, hypochondriasis, and fear of COVID-19?: Journal of Psychiatry and Neurological Sciences","Objective: Mental illnesses are important determinants in response to the pandemic. However, there are only a limited number of studies investigating the effects of COVID-19 in individuals with mental illnesses. We aimed to reveal the fear of COVID-19, somatosensorial amplification levels, anxiety, depression, and stress levels of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Method: We evaluated 500 participants in three groups. This study enrolled 137 patients with MDD, 140 patients with GAD, and 223 healthy controls. Participants were evaluated with the Whiteley Index-7, Somatosensory Amplification Scale (SSAS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale. Results: There was a statistically significant difference between the groups' SSAS, DASS-21, Whiteley Index, and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale scores. In the post hoc analysis, Whiteley Index and DASS-21 subscale scores were higher in patient groups than in the control group (p&lt;0.001). Regression analysis revealed that Whiteley Index, COVID-19 Fear, and DASS-S had a significant effect on somatosensorial amplification. Conclusion: The findings of our study show that MDD and GAD patients are susceptible to normal bodily sensations. COVID-19 fear and hypochondriasis appear to be essential determinants of somatosensorial amplification. Accordingly, there is a need to develop effective psychological interventions focused on these factors in MDD and GAD.","Unal, Gulin Ozdamar, Demiray, Kadriye Ece, Unal, Onur","https://doi.org/10.14744/DAJPNS.2022.00169","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: Dusunen Adam; 35(1):34-42, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31050,""

We administered a webbased survey to young people living in Ontario. Logistic regressions identified predictors of worsening MH and service preferences among a sample of 1341 participants. 61.1% reported worse MH since the pandemic. Worsening MH was significantly associated with one MH and five sociodemographic factors. Participants' MH and service preferences aligned well with clinical practice guidelines in that those with a greater self-reported MH need preferred more intensive MH services.Alternate :Nous avons Ã©tudiÃ© la santÃ© mentale des jeunes de mÃªme que leurs prÃ©fÃ©rences pour les futurs services de santÃ© mentale aux premiers stades de la pandÃ©mie de Covid19 afin de soutenir la planification et la prestation de services axÃ©s sur l'utilisateur.

Epidemics generate fear, anxiety and anguish amongst the general population, and amongst health personnel (especially in nursing), the COVID-19 pandemic has been no exception. The objective of the study was to analyze the psycho-emotional impact of COVID-19 among nurses in the province of Huesca. Methods: Descriptive cross-sectional study, approved by the Ethics Committee. With prior informed consent, anonymously and voluntarily, the participants filled out a questionnaire on psychological symptoms, using the DASS-21Â© scale, the ISIÂ©, the MBIÂ© and the FCV 19SÂ© scales, also collecting sociodemographic, professional and COVID-19 associated variables. Results: The sample consisted of 196 nurses. 16,8% presented depression, 46,4% anxiety, 22,4% stress and 77,6% insomnia, with higher levels amongst the eldest, permanently employed, more experienced nurses, risk comorbidities, less leisure and more hours of work. Psychological Exhaustion (Burnout Syndrome) was detected in 50,5% and fear of coronavirus-19 in 46,9%, variables such as having a position in a COVID-19 unit, more experienced, being a Specialized Care Nurse and not living with family members, triggered greater symptomatology. Regression analyzes showed that the COVID-19 infection was a common risk factor. Conclusions: The SARS CoV-2 health crisis has generated a relevant psychological impact among nursing staff. Therefore, they should be offered psychological support to reduce it and thus ensure their mental health and the valuable care they provide.","Melchor, Alba SimÃ³n, Sesma, MarÃ­a LuÃ­sa JimÃ©nez, CastÃ¡n, Javier Solano, Melchor, LucÃ­a SimÃ³n, Sancho, BenjamÃ­n Gaya, Bosque, Daniel Bordonaba","https://doi.org/10.6018/eglobal.489911","","Database: ProQuest Central; Publication type: article; Publication details: EnfermerÃ­a Global; 21(2):210-233, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31054,""
"The association between sleep disturbance and coronaphobia among physicians in primary health care centers of Ministry of Health, Jazan Province","Background: Sleep disturbances are extremely common among doctors with profound effect on quality of life. Coronaphobia is the dread of COVID-19 that can affect physicians and their sleep quality. Aim of Study: Our study aimed to assess sleep disturbance and its association with coronaphobia among primary health care (PHC) physicians in Primary Health care Centers (PHCCs) of the Ministry of Health, Jazan Province, Saudi Arabia. Method: The study is a cross-sectional questionnaire- based observational investigation using a simple random sampling scheme. The sampling frame was all PHC physicians practicing in Jazan Province. We used the Fear-of-COVID and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires. Poisson Regression modelling techniques were used to analyse the adjusted effect of sociodemographic factors on Fear-of-COVID and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality scores. Results: A total of 385 physicians participated in the study. The prevalence of poor quality of sleep among our physicians was 47.3%, while prevalence of coronaphobia was 56.2%. Coronaphobia had significant negative impact on sleep quality, even with adjustment for the effect of all other clinical and demographic variables. A rise by one point in the fear of COVID questionnaire is associated with a rise by 2.3% points in the PSQI score (indicative of poorer sleep quality, p = 0.00081). Conclusions: Coronaphobia is common and has detrimental effect of sleep quality among PHC physicians. Coronaphobia has negative impact on sleep quality. Higher burden of depressive symptoms worsens physicians' sleep quality. Recommendations: Support for PHC physicians' psychological and physical well-being is paramount during the current COVID-19 crisis.

"An Analysis of the Link between Metacognitive Beliefs and Academic Health-oriented Lifestyle Preventive Behaviours Mediated by Self-efficacy during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The outbreak of the coronavirus and its ramifications, including lockdown and shutting down of many learning centers magnified the necessity of turning to virtual learning, has given rise to concerns about students' learning and their reaction to the new teaching methods and the challenges they entail. The present study attempts to examine the link between metacognitive beliefs and behaviors that prevent health-oriented lifestyles through academic self-efficacy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The statistical sample consisted of 239 randomly selected undergraduate students of engineering at Azad University of Shahre-e Rey in the second semester of 1399-1400 (Solar Hijri calendar). The data were gathered using academic health-oriented lifestyle test Salehzadeh et al. (2018) Academic Self-Efficacy Beliefs Questionnaire (ASEBQ), and Wells' Metacognition Questionnaire-30 (MCQ-30). Findings of the study indicated that metacognitive beliefs are related to behaviors preventing academic health-oriented lifestyle factors, such as learned helplessness and effort withdrawal, through self-efficacy. It is suggested that, according to the positive relationship that exists between metacognitive strategies and academic achievement. As well as these strategies are scalability learners need to be trained in skills such as self-regulation self-monitoring planning and goal setting. Until they dominate decided cognitive strategies and professors can also encourage students to use orientation by designing assignments, teaching study strategies, and using new teaching methods.","Moradi, F.; Sabet, S.

"Evaluation of the clinical characteristic of psychiatric patients who are among the risk groups in the COVID-19 pandemic","Aim: The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has been a major concern for public health worldwide. Traditional medical practices need to be adapted quickly to meet the needs of vulnerable patients due to the COVID-19 outbreak. One of these patient groups is the mentally ill. Although COVID-19 itself affects mental health, this study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients who were previously diagnosed with mental illness. Material and Methods: Patients older than 18 years of age with COVID-19 pneumonia, PCR positive or negative, thoradc CT compatible with COVID-19 pneumonia, and who also had been diagnosed with psychiatric disease between 1 April - 1 October 2020 were included in the study Psychiatric diagnoses of the patients, drugs they used, places they lived, PCR results, CT results, comorbidities, the treatment of COVID-19, and the final status of the patients were evaluated. Results: Between the specified dates, the number of patients with COVID-19 with psychiatric disease was 37 (28.24%) out of 131. The average age of patients with COVID-19 was 56.63 +/- 11.25 years, and the average length of stay in the hospital was 5.57 +/- 1.52 days. There were 35 (94.6%) patients living in a nursing home. There were 26 patients (70.3%) with a previous history of psychiatric illness, and 23 of them (62.2%) had psychotic disorders. During the treatment period, 27 (73.0%) of the patients received multiple pharmacotherapies, and atypical antipsychotic drugs (51.4%) were mostly prescribed. Discussion: As a result, in our study, we determined that living in nursing homes, having a psychiatric disorder, and taking multiple pharmacotherapies due to this psychiatric disorder increase the possibility of getting COVID-19.","Mutlu, P.; Oyekcin, D.

"Measuring depression and anxiety level and determining concerns regarded to pandemic in doctors and nurses working in operating room","Aim: One of the most important conditions for healthcare professionals to work efficiently during the pandemic is to ensure complete physical and mental well-being. This study was planned to measure the depression and anxiety levels of nurses and doctors working in the operating room during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to determine the causes of anxiety related to the pandemic. Material and Methods: This study is a cross-sectional, descriptive and region-stratified survey study. This study was conducted with operating room nurses and doctors who volunteered to participate. Participants were administered a survey consisting of 13 questions that questioned the reasons for concern about COVID-19 in addition to the Beck Anxiety Scale and Beck Depression Scale. Results: There was no difference between doctors and nurses regarding anxiety and depression symptoms. Anxiety level was higher in men. Depression and anxiety levels were high in those who worked for sixteen years and over, while depression and anxiety levels were significantly lower in the 18-35 age group. The most worrisome situation for healthcare professionals was the possibility of working in a unit where they had never worked before. The working area that the participants considered the most risky one in relation to COVID-19 was the emergency operating room. Discussion: We observed that participants showed mild depression symptoms and moderate anxiety. Also, psychological conditions of the younger participants were better.","Acar, K.; Acar, H.; Kamer, E.; Celik, G.

"The effectiveness of POST-DISCHARGE telerehabilitation practices in COVID-19 patients: Tele-COVID study-randomized controlled trial","AIMS: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation exercise program performed without requiring any special equipment on the physical condition of COVID-19 subjects. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled study. METHODS: This study included subjects with a history of hospitalization with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and discharged within 4 weeks. The subjects were divided into two groups randomly, namely telerehabilitation group (TeleGr, n = 17) or control group (CGr, n = 17). The TeleGr received breathing and range of motion exercises, active cycle of breathing technique, and an aerobic training 3 days a week for 6 weeks, while CGr received an exercise brochure with the same content. Subjects were evaluated using the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score for dyspnea, 30 s sit-to-stand test (30STS) and short physical performance battery (SPPB) to determine their physical status, Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) to assess quality of their life, and Beck Depression Inventory. All evaluations were carried out at home using videoconferencing. RESULTS: A significant improvement was observed in TelerGr in terms of mMRC (P= 0.035), 30STS (P= 0.005), 5 sit-to-stand time which is one of the subtests of SPPB (P = 0.039) and SGRQ scores. Significant improvement was observed only in the pain score in the CGr (P = 0.039). There was a statistically significant difference between the groups in SGRQ activity (P = 0.035) and total (P = 0.042) scores. In addition, more symptomatic improvement was found in TeleGr. CONCLUSION: Telerehabilitation exercise program with less technical equipment is a good alternative treatment method for COVID-19 subjects, which improves the quality of life and symptomatic status of subjects.

This study explores the interconnectedness of loneliness, anxiety and depression on a symptom level using network analysis. A representative sample of participants (N = 1041), who were of at least 18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years of age, was recruited from the Republic of Ireland (ROI). Loneliness, anxiety and depression were assessed using validated instruments. Network analysis was used to identify the network structure of loneliness, anxiety and depression. Loneliness was found to be largely isolated from anxiety and depression nodes in the network. Anxiety and depression were largely interconnected. ""Trouble relaxing,"" ""feeling bad about oneself"" and ""not being able to stop or control worrying"" were suggested as the most influential nodes of the network. Despite the expectation that loneliness would be implicated more robustly in the anxiety and depression network of symptoms, the results suggest loneliness as a distinct construct that is not interwoven with anxiety and depression.","Owczarek, Nolan, Shevlin, Butter, Karatzias, McBride, Murphy, Vallieres, Bentall, Martinez, Hyland","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12851","20220506","Anxiety; Depression; Loneliness","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31062,""

"Psychiatric manifestations and associated risk factors among hospitalised patients with COVID-19 in Edo State, Nigeria: a cross-sectional study","To estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety and identify associated risk factors in hospitalised persons with confirmed COVID-19 in Edo, Nigeria. A multicentre cross-sectional survey. Patients with COVID-19 hospitalised at the three government-designated treatment and isolation centres in Edo State, Nigeria. The study was conducted from 15 April to 11 November 2020 among 489 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and in treatment and isolation centres in Edo State, Nigeria. The mean age of participants was 43.39 (SD=16.94) years. Male participants were 252 (51.5%) and female were 237 (48.5%). The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire for depression, (total score: 0-27, depression Ã¢â€°Â¥10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 for anxiety (total score: 0-21, anxiety Ã¢â€°Â¥10),Ã¢â‚¬â€°and social demographic and clinical characteristics for associated risk factors. Of the 489 participants, 49.1% and 38.0% had depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The prevalence rates of depression, anxiety and combination of both were 16.2%, 12.9% and 9.0%, respectively. Moderate-severe symptoms of COVID-19, Ã¢â€°Â¥14 days in isolation, worrying about the outcome of infection and stigma increased the risk of having depression and anxiety. Additionally, being separated/divorced increased the risk of having depression and having comorbidity increased the risk of having anxiety. A substantial proportion of our participants experienced depression, anxiety and a combination of both especially in those who had the risk factors we identified. The findings underscore the need to address modifiable risk factors for psychiatric manifestations early in the course of the disease and integrate mental health interventions and psychosocial support into COVID-19 management guidelines.","Okogbenin, Seb-Akahomen, Edeawe, Ehimigbai, Eboreime, Odike, Obagaye, Aweh, Erohubie, Eriyo, Inogbo, Akhideno, Eifediyi, Eifediyi, Asogun, Okogbenin","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-058561","20220506","COVID-19; Depression &amp; mood disorders; PSYCHIATRY","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31064,""

Cross-sectional study. September-October 2020 in the UK. Online survey hosted on Qualtrics, and recruited through Prolific. 400 health and social care workers, aged 18 or above and living and working in the UK during the pandemic. MIEs were assessed using the Moral Injury Events Scale and PTED was assessed using the PTED self-rating scale. Potential predictors were measured using surveys of exposure to occupational stressors, optimism, self-esteem, resilient coping style, consideration of future consequences and personal belief in a just world. 19% of participants displayed clinical levels of PTED, and 73% experienced at least one COVID-related MIE. Exposure to occupational stressors increased the risk of experiencing PTED and MIEs, whereas personal belief in a procedurally just world, which is the belief that they experienced fair processes, was a protective mechanism. MIEs and PTED are being experienced by UK health and social care professionals, particularly in those exposed to work-related stressors.","Brennan, McKay, Cole","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-054062","20220506","COVID-19; health policy; mental health; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31065,""
"Moral Injury and Telemental Health Services: An Overview on Clinician Impact","Moral injury develops from enduring complex moral conflicts that occur when one's beliefs and values are violated by committing, perpetrating, failing to prevent, or witnessing acts that transgress one's deep moral compass. In response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the extraordinary impact to patients and health care systems around the globe, telemental health has rapidly expanded as a means to optimize resource use and comply with social distancing mandates. Social determinants of health, which include financial inequity, have influences on pandemic situations, such as physical distancing and lockdowns, resulting in disproportionate delays in timely mental health diagnosis and management. The current article discusses an overview of how the demands of the pandemic have forced mental health clinicians working in telemental health to face a wide range of complex ethical and moral dilemmas.

"THE IMPACT OF MENTAL HEALTH, SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS AND RELIGIOUS COPING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF NURSING STUDENTS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC","The aim of this study is to examine the effect of psychological distress and religious coping in quality of life of nursing students during the second wave of the pandemic in Greece. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among nursing students. Data were collected via an e-survey consisting of five parts including HADS Questionary, SF-36, B-RCOPE and Subjective Happiness scale. Results: From the total of 200 nursing students the 86.5% were female, 35.5% were in their first year of study, 54% were single and 65.5 were urban residents. 51.9% of the students were experiencing anxiety and 31,5% were depressed. In regard to subjective happiness, the mean value was 4.51Ã‚Â±1.27. In addition, the majority of the students consider themselves unhappy (67.5%). Finally, in regard to SF-36 scores, we observed that PCS mean score was 68.49Ã‚Â±13.19, MCS56.12Ã‚Â±24.23. Depression, as well as negative religious coping, can have a negative effect on both physical and mental health components of quality of life.

"Utilizing a CBPR approach to assess the impact of COVID-19 on individuals who receive publicly funded behavioral health services","The coronavirus disease pandemic has highlighted significant gaps in community mental health services, placing vulnerable individuals at greater risk for mental health and substance use difficulties via disrupting their wellness journey. Guided by a wellness framework, a needs assessment was conducted among adult consumers of behavioral health services to understand their needs during the pandemic and to help develop and strengthen service delivery strategies. A team of three university researchers and four Consumer Researchers, who receive services at a publicly funded community mental health center, engaged in a community-based participatory project in which 13 focus groups were conducted with 51 consumers. Several themes emerged from a thematic analysis of transcripts regarding consumer well-being and healthcare needs, coping strategies employed, and the accessibility, benefits, and perception of clinical and support services during the pandemic. Results highlighted strengths in service delivery and areas in need of enhancement.

"The Impact of COVID-19 on Social Workers: An Assessment of Peritraumatic Distress","There is broad consensus that COVID-19 has had a pernicious impact on social work, in general, and among social work practitioners, more specifically. However, at present, very few, if any, empirical examinations of this impact exist. This exploratory study examined peritraumatic distress among a sample of social workers (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3920) in one southeastern state in the United States. Analysis suggests that distress is impacted by several variables. In general, participants identifying as male, married, reporting good physical and mental health, working in microcontexts, and who were finically secure tended to experience less COVID-19 associated distress. In addition, social workers identifying as LGBTQ* and who had been working mostly remotely experienced higher levels of distress. Overall, findings indicate the need to provide adept support to social workers practicing during the pandemic. Data suggest the need for targeted support initiatives, typically for those who are from underrepresented groups (e.g., LGBTQ*) or experiencing financial or mental/physical health issues. Certainly, researchers should continue to examine the impact of COVID-19 on social work practitioners and service delivery.","Miller, Grise-Owens","https://doi.org/10.1177/14680173211013243","20220506","Social work; human rights; research; research minded practice; resilience; social service","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31071,""

"Chinese University Students' Awareness and Acceptance of the COVID-19 Vaccine: A Cross-Sectional Study","The emergence of the mutant virus has exacerbated the COVID-19 epidemic, and vaccines remain an effective and viable means of resistance. As a socially influential young group, university students' awareness and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine are crucial to achieving herd immunity. This study aimed to assess the awareness and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among Chinese university students and identify possible factors associated with their awareness level and vaccine hesitancy. An anonymous cross-sectional survey was conducted among Chinese university students between 10 and 28 June 2021. We collected information on the demographic characteristics, awareness and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine, and influencing factors. Sleep disturbances and anxiety disorders were also evaluated. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Among the 721 participants (aged 18 to 23 years) with a female predominance (68.9%), 40.4% of cases exhibited moderate awareness the COVID-19 vaccine, and 87.4% of cases expressed high acceptance of the vaccine. Participants' awareness of the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with gender, ethnicity, region of residence, grade level, satisfaction with current state of pandemic control, the perceived likelihood of a COVID-19 pandemic rebound, the source number of COVID-19 information, concerns about differences in vaccine manufacturers, acceptance of current state-approved vaccines and insomnia level. Furthermore, age, preferred channels for vaccination and the acceptance of current state-approved vaccines were significantly associated with their acceptance of the vaccine. This study reflected Chinese university students' high acceptance, but insufficient awareness of the COVID-19 vaccine, some students have insomnia and anxiety problems. These require the government to take measures such as individualized publicity and education, adding professional psychological counseling courses to improve the university students' awareness of vaccines and public health events, and comprehensively promote vaccination to cope with the ever-changing situation of the COVID-19 epidemic.","Li, Gao, Zhong, Yu, Li, Bi","https://doi.org/10.2147/RMHP.S360274","20220506","COVID-19 vaccine; mental health; university students; vaccine hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31074,""
"Strategies and lessons learned from a longitudinal study to maximize recruitment in the midst of a global pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted many usual processes for recruiting and enrolling research participants. We present our experience with electronic recruitment in a survey study investigating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health. Adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) in communities served by Baylor Scott and White Health (BSWH) were recruited via patient portal messages sent to BSWH patients with confirmed/suspected COVID-19 as part of the ""COVID-19 Digital Care Journey""; BSWH social media posts; other media; referral from other BSWH COVID-19 studies; and internal BSWH communications. Of 1279 enrolled participants, 996 (77.87%) were recruited via the Digital Care Journey and 124 (9.7%) via internal communications. The remaining strategies contributed &lt;5% each. Social media and internal communications recruited larger proportions of those aged 18 to 34 and those with advanced degrees; other media, more racially diverse participants; and the Digital Care Journey and referral from other studies, predominantly participants positive for COVID-19. In terms of volume, the COVID-19 Digital Care Journey was the most successful strategy, particularly for individuals who had COVID-19. However, its dominance contributed to the overrepresentation of white, educated, and female participants.

"Impact of the Harm Review Service for Patients Awaiting Elective Hip and Knee Surgeries for More Than 52 Weeks","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected medical practice worldwide. In the UK, elective operative lists had to be postponed to accommodate the increase in hospital admissions. Within our local trauma and orthopaedic department, a harm review clinic was developed for these postponed elective cases. The purpose of this clinic was to evaluate the impact and outcomes of the delay in elective hip and knee procedures. Methodology The elective list database of William Harvey Hospital, Kent, from April to December 2020 was retrospectively analysed. Inclusion criteria included all lower limb primary arthroplasty, elective lower limb revision surgery, and other hip and knee procedure patients waiting more than 52 weeks for surgery. All patients had telephone consultations averaging 10 minutes. Data included patients' symptoms, fresh investigations, changes in treatment plans, mental health status, and value of consultation were assessedÃ‚Â and recorded. Results A total of 242 patients from eight lower limb consultants were analysed.Ã‚Â Patients with hip pathology accounted for 39.2% (95 patients) versus knee pathology accounting for 60.7% (147 patients). In total, 13 (5.37%) patients reported improvement in their physical symptoms, whereas 46 (19%) felt their symptoms worsen. Overall, 26 (10.7%) patients had a change in their treatment plan following the consultation. In total, 18 (7.4%) patients required further face-to-face follow-up following the telephone consultation There were no patients who had significant physical or mental harm. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has brought changes in how we practice medicine. The harm review service has been a valuable service to both patients and the orthopaedic department. This harms review clinic was able to identify changes in treatment plans for patients. A small percentage of patients required face-to-face appointments. We suggest telephone assessment should be the first mode of communication with patients. Further studies should be conducted in other specialities to determine if there are similar outcomes.","Divekar, Divekar, M Navaratnam, Shrivastava","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.23805","20220506","arthritis; delay in surgery; elective orthopaedic surgery; hip and knee replacement; mental wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31076,""
"Social Capital as Protection Against the Mental Health Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic","The corona pandemic has a huge impact on the mental wellbeing of the Dutch population. Based on a large-scale panel survey (<i>N</i> = 22,696) on the social impact of COVID-19, this article firstly examines which social groups are most susceptible to the mental health consequences of the pandemic. Secondly, we examine whether social capital provides protection against this impact. We find that the mental health impact of COVID-19 is considerable and that it increased over the course of 2020. Women, young people, respondents with low incomes and/or poor self-perceived health, experience relatively more fear and stress due to the pandemic. We do not find a difference between respondents with or without a migration background. Social capital (received support, trust in people and in institutions) has the expected effect: the more support and trust, the less fear and stress. There is a mediation effect. Older people, respondents with high incomes and/or good health experience less fear and stress, partly because they have more social capital. This is different for females. They would experience even more fear and stress, compared to men, were it not for the fact that they have more social capital. Hence we conclude that social capital indeed provides some protection against the negative mental health consequences of COVID-19.","Snel, Engbersen, de Boom, van Bochove","https://doi.org/10.3389/fsoc.2022.728541","20220506","COVID-19; mental wellbeing; social capital; social support; trust","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31077,""
"Quantifying depression-related language on social media during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic had clear impacts on mental health. Social media presents an opportunity for assessing mental health at the population level. 1) Identify and describe language used on social media that is associated with discourse about depression. 2) Describe the associations between identified language and COVID-19 incidence over time across several geographies. We create a word embedding based on the posts in Reddit's /r/Depression and use this word embedding to train representations of active authors. We contrast these authors against a control group and extract keywords that capture differences between the two groups. We filter these keywords for face validity and to match character limits of an information retrieval system, Elasticsearch. We retrieve all geo-tagged posts on Twitter from April 2019 to June 2021 from Seattle, Sydney, Mumbai, and Toronto. The tweets are scored with BM25 using the keywords. We call this score rDD. We compare changes in average score over time with case counts from the pandemic's beginning through June 2021. We observe a pattern in rDD across all cities analyzed: There is an increase in rDD near the start of the pandemic which levels off over time. However, in Mumbai we also see an increase aligned with a second wave of cases. Our results are concordant with other studies which indicate that the impact of the pandemic on mental health was highest initially and was followed by recovery, largely unchanged by subsequent waves. However, in the Mumbai data we observed a substantial rise in rDD with a large second wave. Our results indicate possible un-captured heterogeneity across geographies, and point to a need for a better understanding of this differential impact on mental health.","Davis, McKnight, Teodorescu, Quan-Haase, Chunara, Fyshe, Lizotte","https://doi.org/10.23889/ijpds.v5i4.1716","20220506","COVID-19; Twitter; depression; information retrieval; machine learning; public health surveillance; social media","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31078,""
"Longitudinal Impact of Social Restrictions on Sexual Health in the Italian Population","Several trials have reported on the impact of social restrictions due to SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic on sexual function and psycho-physical well-being. However, data showing modifications of these outcomes over time and at the end of lock-down are scant. We investigated the longitudinal changes in sexual function during social restrictions for COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. A web-based survey was administered to Italian citizens of legal age via social networks. The Beck Depression Inventory Primary Care, the General Health Survey, Female Sexual Function Index, International Index of Erectile Function, UCLA Loneliness Scale-version 3 questionnaires were used to test mental, physical and sexual well-being. The questionnaires were administered at the beginning of the lockdown (T0), 15 days from the first assessment (T1) and 1 month after the end of the restrictions in 2020 (T2). Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis were applied to investigate changes in sexual function over and at the end of social restrictions. Data were available for 2543 people (47.2% of men; 43.4% women; 9.4% undefined). Mean age was 48.3 Ã‚Â± 15.1 years for males and 43.9 Ã‚Â± 13.4 for females. Overall, 2.6% reported depressive symptoms according to Beck Depression Inventory Primary Care, 7.4% reported a high level of UCLA loneliness and 19.4% low levels of general mental health. Mild to severe erectile dysfunction was reported by 59.1% of men at T0, while 68.4% of women reported sexual dysfunction. Sexual function levels remain generally unchanged at further follow-up over the social restriction time period (T1), although those who were sexually active at baseline showed a decrease in sexual function scores. At T2, there was an overall improvement in sexual function scores with a rate of severe erectile dysfunction decreasing from 37.1% to 24.1% from T0 to T2 among males and a significant decrease of female sexual dysfunction from 68.4% to 51.2%. Young individuals and those with good mental and physical health were more likely to improve sexual function at the end of social restrictions. Valid and reliable questionnaires and longitudinal approach design represent strengths; a large but convenient sample and lack of pre-pandemic baseline data represent limits. Social restrictions due to COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in sexual dysfunctions in both genders. However, these conditions appeared temporary since an overall improvement was observed at the end of lockdown and especially in younger individuals with higher psycho-physical well-being.

"Mental health status of adolescents in-home quarantine: a multi-region, cross-sectional study during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh","The population's mental and physical health worldwide are currently at risk due to the coronavirus pandemic. We evaluated the mental health status of the adolescents trapped indoors because of the precautionary restrictions and prolonged closure of the educational institutions. A cross-sectional study was conducted on adolescents from multiple urban and semi-urban areas of Bangladesh from 22 January to 3 February 2021. A self-reported online questionnaire containing questions regarding sociodemographic factors, home quarantine-related factors and mental health symptoms was distributed to collect data. Descriptive analysis, bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were performed to measure the association of the variables. Cronbach's alpha was estimated to present the internal consistency of the scales. A total of 322 adolescents (aged 12-19) with a mean age of 16.00Ã‚Â years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°1.84) responded to the invitation. 54.97% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°177) of them were male, and the participants were predominantly urban residents (87.27%, nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°281). We observed varying degrees of depression in 67.08%, anxiety in 49.38% and stress in 40.68% of the participants according to DASS-21. Age, sex, education, mother's occupation, total monthly income, playing sports, doing household chores, going out of home, watching television, using the internet, attending online classes, changing food habits, and communicating with friends had a positive significant association with mental health burdens. Home quarantine has a noticeable adverse impact on the mental health of teenagers. Psychological evaluations and counselling via online and offline programs are essential to improve adolescents' declining mental health conditions.","Afrin, Nasrullah, Dalal, Tasnim, Benzadid, Humayra, Saif-Ur-Rahman, Hawlader","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40359-022-00819-3","20220505","Adolescents; Anxiety; Bangladesh; COVID-19; Depression; Home quarantine; Lockdown; Mental health; Pandemic; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31080,""
"Associations of mothers' and fathers' structure-related food parenting practices and child food approach eating behaviors during the COVID pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, many mothers and fathers have spent more time at home with their children, warranting consideration of parenting practices around food during the pandemic as influences on obesogenic eating behaviors among children. Structure-related feeding practices, particularly around snacking, may be particularly challenging yet influential in the pandemic setting. Parent sex and levels of feeding-related co-operation among parents (co-feeding) are understudied potential influences on parent-child feeding relationships. We investigated relationships between structure-related parent feeding and child food approach behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic, while considering potential moderating influences of parent sex and co-feeding levels. An online survey was completed by 318 parents (206 mothers and 112 fathers) of 2-12-year-olds who were living in states with statewide or regional lockdowns in May/June 2020 within the United States. Mothers and fathers were drawn from different families, with each survey corresponding to a unique parent-child dyad. Parental stress/mental health, co-feeding (Feeding Coparenting Scale), structure-related food and snack parenting (Feeding Practices and Structure Questionnaire and Parenting around SNAcking Questionnaire), and child eating behaviors (Child Eating Behaviour Questionnaire) were assessed. Relationships of parents' structure-related food and snack parenting practices with their child's emotional overeating and food responsiveness behaviors were examined using structural equation modelling. Further, we investigated whether these relations were moderated by parent sex or level of co-feeding. Parent sex differences were seen in parental stress, mental health, and co-feeding, but not in structure-related food and snack parenting or child food approach eating behaviors. Structure-related food parenting was negatively associated with emotional overeating. However, structure-related snack parenting was positively associated with emotional overeating and food responsiveness. While regression paths varied between mothers vs. fathers, as well as by co-feeding levels, neither parent sex nor co-feeding levels significantly moderated relationships between parent feeding and child eating variables. Future studies of food and snack parenting and co-operation in relation to feeding among mothers and fathers within a familial unit may be critical to identify intervention strategies that draw on all family resources to better navigate future disruptive events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jansen, Smith, Thapaliya, Sadler, Aghababian, Carnell","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2022.113837","20220505","COVID-19; child eating; co-feeding; fathers; mothers; structure-related feeding","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31081,""

"Automated Intraoperative Short Messaging Service Updates: Quality Improvement Initiative to Relieve Caregivers' Worries","Undergoing a surgical procedure is anxiety provoking for patients and their caregivers. During the intraoperative period, caregivers seek out informational updates from health care professionals, a situation complicated by COVID-19 health measures that require caregivers to wait outside the hospital. Short messaging service (SMS)-based communication that allows caregivers to follow their loved ones through surgery has shown promise in relieving anxiety and improving satisfaction with overall care. This form of communication is also well accepted by health care professionals and may be effective at relieving staff burden. Here, we describe a quality improvement initiative of a standardized and integrated intraoperative SMS-based system to improve communication between surgical teams and caregivers. The main goal was to improve satisfaction with care, while the secondary goal was to reduce caregiver anxiety. The initiative followed the framework of the Model for Improvement. A large tertiary care hospital offered the SMS to caregivers who were waiting for loved ones undergoing surgery. SMS messages were integrated into the clinical information system software and sent at key points during the surgical journey to phone numbers provided by caregivers. A satisfaction survey was sent to caregivers 1 business day after surgery. Data were collected between February 16 and July 14, 2021. Of the 8129 surgeries scheduled, caregivers waiting for 6149 (75.6%) surgeries agreed to receive SMS messages. A total of 34,129 messages were sent. The satisfaction survey was completed by 2088 (34%) of the 6149 caregivers. Satisfaction with messages was high, with the majority of respondents reporting that the messages received were adequate (1476/2085, 70.8%), clear (1545/2077, 74.4%), informative (1488/2078, 71.6%), and met their needs (1234/2077, 59.4%). The overall satisfaction score was high (4.5 out of 5), and caregivers reported that receiving text messages resulted in a reduction in anxiety (score=8.2 out of 10). Technical errors were reported by 69 (3.3%) caregivers. Suggestions for improvements included having messages sent more often; providing greater patient details, including the patient's health status; and the service being offered in other languages. This digital health initiative provided SMS messages that were systematically sent to caregivers waiting for their loved ones undergoing surgery, just as COVID-19 restrictions began preventing waiting onsite. The messages were used across 15 surgical specialties and have since been implemented hospital-wide. Digital health care innovations have the capacity to improve family-centered communication; what patients and their families find useful and appreciate will ultimately determine their success.","Mignault, Tchouaket Nguemeleu, Robins, Maillet, Matetsa, Dupuis","https://doi.org/10.2196/36208","20220506","COVID-19; OR nurse; SMS; anxiety; caregiver; communication; digital health; digital health care; intraoperative; mHealth; mental health; perioperative; short messaging service; surgery; surgical; surgical procedure; technology; text message","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-05-07","",31083,""
