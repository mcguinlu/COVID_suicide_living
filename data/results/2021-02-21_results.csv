"Statewide Impact of COVID-19 on Social Determinants of Health - A First Look: Findings from the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin","There is an urgent need to track the early and ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on population health from local to global scales. At the same time, there is an overall lack of U.S. state-specific surveillance data tracking social determinants of health (SDOH) and associations with population well-being, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic in populations. Statewide data can offer important insights into how SDOH shape the long-term effects of COVID-19 in the population since implementation of many policies and programs varied widely early on in the pandemic. In May of 2020, the Survey of the Health of Wisconsin (SHOW) program launched a statewide online/phone survey of early and ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on health and well-being across diverse communities and families. The goal of this study is to provide descriptive data including perceived COVID-19 risks, access to and results of COVID-19 antigen testing, individual mitigation and coping strategies, family dynamics and other economic shocks of the pandemic on health and mental health in populations. Key findings include higher rates of testing and perceived past infection from COVID-19 among non-white respondents. Higher economic shifts and job changes in female vs male respondents. Families with children reported overall higher levels of stress, and stress from the pandemic. There were urban and rural differences in changes to access to care. Rural regions, which had a lower prevalence of infections early in the pandemic as compared to urban areas, also reported fewer delays or missed appointments due to COVID-19. Key findings show that SDOH are shaping impacts of health and well-being early on in the pandemic and future longitudinal follow-up will be important to shape policies and programs well into the future.","Kristen MC Malecki; Amy A Schultz; Maria Nikodemova; Matthew C Walsh; Andrew J.

"Demographic, psychological, and environmental factors affecting student's health during the COVID-19 pandemic: on the rocks","The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) is spreading exponentially, increasing fear, depression, and other mental health disorders in the general public. Pakistan's economy is suffered mainly by the novel coronavirus. The massive healthcare expenditures bring inadequacy to manage COVID-19. The study explored the effects of coronavirus fear among the students who remain in their homes due to educational institutions' closure. The study results show that female students mostly fear the coronavirus pandemic compared to their male counterparts that negatively impact their health. The &quot;age&quot; of the students and &quot;household size&quot; positively impact students' health, while the student's existing &quot;healthcare profile&quot; is not competitive enough to escape from the deadly coronavirus. The &quot;knowledge&quot; for the coronavirus pandemic and its prevention guidelines is the only solution to contain coronavirus. Simultaneously, &quot;ignorance&quot; is the foremost factor that could be more dangerous to spread coronavirus among the students; besides the COVID-19 pandemic, students and general public health mainly suffered from environmental pollution. The current epidemic also exacerbated environmental concerns among students isolated in their homes, and their outdoor activities are primarily limited. Hence, the student's quality of life is exposed mainly to environmental pollution over time. The &quot;healthcare expenditures&quot; and &quot;government support&quot; both are not competitive enough to control novel coronavirus. Thus, it required more sustainable strategic policies and national unity to controlled coronavirus with firm conviction and provincial synchronization.","Anser, Sharif, Khan, Nassani, Zaman, Abro, Kabbani","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-12991-x","20210220","COVID-19; Environmental pollution; Government support; Healthcare expenditures; Ignorance; Knowledge; StudentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-21","",10985,""
"50 Years of Behavioral Science in Diabetes: A 2020 Vision of the Future","This article is adapted from a speech Dr. de Groot delivered in June 2020 as President, Health Care &amp; Education, of the American Diabetes Association at the Association's 80th Scientific Sessions, which was held online as a result of coronavirus disease 2019. Dr. de Groot is an Associate Professor of Medicine in the Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism at Indiana University (IU) School of Medicine. She serves as the Acting Director of the IU Diabetes Translational Research Center. Dr. de Groot is the 2020 recipient of the Rachmiel Levine Medal for Leadership from the American Diabetes Association.In the year 2020, we marked the 50th anniversary of the field of behavioral science in diabetes in the modern era. Over this relatively short period of time, this field has charted the psychosocial landscape of prediabetes and diabetes by establishing the prevalence and impact of emotional and behavioral aspects of diabetes. Interventions to address these conditions have been developed that span the T2 to T4 translational research spectrum ranging from the intrapsychic to population-based interventions. Policies ranging from standards of care to Medicare benefits have been implemented. A review of research in the area of diabetes and depression is provided as an example of innovations in this field. Behavior is the foundation of all interventions we make in diabetes and prediabetes. As a mature science, it is critical to stemming the tide of diabetes and its outcomes. To make additional strides, we must rebalance our focus and augment funding for behavioral interventions for individuals, communities, and health care systems in conjunction with other forms of treatment.","de Groot","https://doi.org/10.2337/dci20-0058","20210220","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-21","",10986,""
"Suicidal behaviors and suicide risk among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic: An online cross-sectional survey","Background Suicide, a major public health concern, is a leading cause of injury and death worldwide. The present study aims to assess suicidal behaviors and suicide risk among Bangladeshi people during COVID-19. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from July 10 to July 20, 2020, involving 1,415 Bangladeshi residents ages 18 years or older. Data was collected via an anonymous online questionnaire. The Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised was used to assess suicide risk. The depression and anxiety subscales of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21 were used to assess depression and anxiety. Logistic regression analyses and Pearson's correlation were performed to examine the association of variables. Results The prevalence of suicide ideation and planning among Bangladeshi people during the COVID-19 pandemic was 19.0% and 18.5%, respectively. Having suicidal risk during the COVID-19 pandemic was reported by 33.5% participants. Suicide risk was associated higher with females, divorced or widowed marital statuses and low educational attainment (i.e., secondary or below and higher secondary/diploma). Additionally, living in high COVID-19 prevalent areas, having economic loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic, relatives or acquaintances die from COVID-19, direct contact with COVID-19 patient(s), and fear of COVID-19 infection were associated with suicide risk. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic imposes significant psychological consequences on people, thus, concerned authorities should pay attention to people's mental health and focus on suicide prevention and awareness during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05937","20210201","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-21","",10987,""
