"A cross sectional study found differential risks for COVID-19 seropositivity amongst health care professionals in Chile","Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, however not all face the same risk. We aimed to determine IgG/IgM prevalence and risk factors associated with seropositivity in Chilean HCWs. This was a nationwide, cross-sectional study including a questionnaire and COVID-19 lateral flow IgG/IgM antibody testing. All HCWs in the Chilean public health care system were invited to participate following the country's first wave. IgG/IgM positivity in 85,529 HCWs was 7.2%, ranging from 1.6% to 12.4% between regions. Additionally, 9.7% HCWs reported a positive PCR of which 47% were seropositive. Overall, 10,863 (12.7%) HCWs were PCR and/or IgG/IgM positive.Factors independently associated with increased odds ratios (ORs) for seropositivity were: working in a hospital, night shifts, contact with Covid-19, using public transport, male gender, age&gt;45, BMI Ã¢â€°Â¥30, and reporting Ã¢â€°Â¥2 symptoms. Stress/mental health disorder and smoking were associated with decreased ORs. These factors remained significant when including PCR positive cases in the model. HCWs in the hospital were at highest risk for COVID-19, and several independent risk factors for seropositivity and/or PCR positivity were identified.","ZuÃƒÂ±iga, Lagomarcino, MuÃƒÂ±oz, Alonso, Rodriguez, O'Ryan","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2021.12.026","20211229","COVID-19; antibody prevalence; healthcare workers; vaccine priority","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24432,""
"Evaluation of Peritraumatic Distress at the Point of Care: A Cross-Sectional Study","COVID-19 related peritraumatic distress has been investigated in the general population with contrasting results probably due to also to the perceived risk of developing COVID-19. Our study aims to investigate this condition in individuals with ascertained or probable SARS-CoV-2 exposure. The Coronavirus Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI) was administered to people attending a COVID-19 point of care. The sample was stratified for perceived risk in SARS-Cov-2 positive cases, close contacts, case relatives, undergoing screening subjects, and symptomatic subjects. 1463 subjects participated, and with a mean CPDI Score of 28.2 (SD 16.9). CPDI Scores in SARS-Cov-2 positive cases were significantly higher than case relatives (p=0.02) Multiple logistic regression revealed that belonging to the working changes (p=0.001), night sleep changes (p&lt;0.001), physical activity reduction (p=0.002), alcohol consumption changes (p=0.003), and at least one relative missed due to COVID-19 (p&lt;0.001) independently predicted with higher CPDI scores. Male sex (p&lt;0.001), ageÃ¢â€°Â¥35 (p&lt;0.001), higher educational level (p=0.002), night sleep hours&gt;7 (p=0.002) and being physically active (p=0.018) resulted in protective factors. Cross-sectional design and the regional basis limited the generality of results. The mean CPDI values of the sample examined were above the threshold for medium grade peritraumatic distress, with increased CPDI scores in subjects who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, compared to family members or caregivers without a clear indication to undergo the swab. The assessment of specific demographic, physical and mental health events could be used to identify individuals that may benefit from early treatment for COVID-19 related peritraumatic distress.","Pontoni, Caiolo, Miola, Moriglia, Lunardi, Garofalo, Sambataro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.101","20211229","COVID-19; CPDI; Mental Health; Pandemic; Peritraumatic Distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24433,""
"Assessment of the difference in depressive symptoms of the Korean adult population before and during the COVID-19 pandemic using a community health survey","The aim of this study was to evaluate the rate of depression during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to that during the prepandemic period. Data from participants in the Korean Community Health Survey in 2019 and 2020 aged Ã¢â€°Â¥ 19 years old were analyzed. In total, the data of 223,306 participants from the 2020 group were compared with the data of 217,133 participants from the 2019 group regarding the experience and severity of depression. The experience of depression was surveyed in terms of a history of sadness or despair for Ã¢â€°Â¥2 weeks in the last year. In addition, the PHQ-9 scores were used, and participants with PHQ-9 scores Ã¢â€°Â¥10 were recategorized as having moderate to severe depression. The odds for depression of the 2020 group compared to the 2019 group based on the survey and PHQ-9 scores were calculated using simple or multiple logistic regression with complex sampling with weighted values. The rate of depression experience was lower in the 2020 group than in the 2019 group. The odds of experiencing depression were lower in the 2020 group than in the 2019 group (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.95, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.91-0.98, P=0.004).

"Adaptation and psychometric evaluation of Hungarian version of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale","COVID-19 pandemic has had a global major healthcare, social and economic impact. In present study we aim to adapt the Fear of COVID-19 Scale to Hungarian. Forward-backward translation method was used to translate the English version of the scale to Hungarian. Participants were a convenience sample of 2175 university students and employees. The study was conducted between January 18th and February 12th 2021. The test battery included Hungarian versions of Fear of COVID-19 scale, short Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-H) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The scale showed one-factor structure, the loadings on the factor were significant and strong (from .47 to .84). Internal consistency was very good (ÃŽÂ± = .84). Construct validity for the Fear of COVID-19 Scale was supported by significant and positive correlations with STAI (r = 0.402; p &lt; 0.001) and BDI-H (r = 0.270; p &lt; 0.001).

"E-cigarette or Vaping product use Associated Lung Injury (EVALI) in the time of COVID-19: A clinical dilemma","To report on the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings of adolescents who presented during the SARS-CoV-2 surge with symptoms of COVID-19, did not test positive for the infection and were diagnosed with e-cigarette and vaping product use associated lung injury (EVALI). A retrospective review of 12 cases of EVALI admitted to the Bristol Meyers Squibb Children's Hospital between February 2020 and June 2020 was conducted. The ages of the patients ranged from 14 to 19 years. There were 6 males and 6 females. Three patients had a past history of anxiety, depression or other psychiatric/mental health disorder, nine had prolonged coagulation profile (PT,PTT and/or INR) and eleven had elevated inflammatory markers. Eight needed respiratory support. All 12 were negative for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. Four were tested for IgG Antibodies and were negative. As these cases were admitted to rule out COVID infection, initial treatment included hydroxychloroquine. Steroids were started only after SARS-CoV-2 PCR was shown to be negative. Urine THC was positive in all cases. CXR and CT findings showed ground glass opacities. Clinical and radiological features are similar in both EVALI and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Inflammatory markers are elevated in both conditions. A detailed social and substance use history in patients presenting with ""typical"" COVID pneumonia like illness is important. EVALI should be ruled in early to start the appropriate treatment. Given the ongoing pandemic, pediatricians and other health care providers need to be aware of other conditions that can masquerade as SARS-CoV-2. This article is protected by copyright.

"Well-Being and the Pandemic: Trust in People Matters More Than Trust in Institutions","Trust is an important correlate of well-being, and it plays an important moderating role against adversity. But does this conclusion also hold during pandemics? We address this question by investigating the role of interpersonal and institutional trust for well-being, as measured by five proxies, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Serbia. We also examined age and gender differences in the relationship between trust and well-being, and tested the protective role of trust among individuals whose well-being might be at risk during the pandemic. The sample included a total of 5776 Serbian adults (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 37.00 years, 75% female). The results showed that interpersonal trust has a small but significant relationship with well-being, whereas institutional trust has negligible effects. We also found some evidence for the protective role of general interpersonal trust on well-being among individuals with poorer self-rated health and in a poorer financial situation. Our findings confirm the role of interpersonal trust for well-being in times of crisis, and support previous evidence indicating that promoting interpersonal trust should be a core goal of public policy.","JovanoviÃ„â€¡, Sarracino, LaziÃ„â€¡, Gavrilov-JerkoviÃ„â€¡","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211061692","20211229","COVID-19; Trust; affect; anxiety; depression; global crisis; life satisfaction; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24437,""
"The relationship between COVID-19-induced death thoughts and depression during a national lockdown","Evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased rates of depression worldwide. Many factors have been identified to relate to this increase depression, but according to Terror Management Theory, the heightened awareness of death during the pandemic has the potential to increase depression for those with low self-esteem. This hypothesis was examined in a U.K. sample during the first national lockdown where depression, self-esteem and death-thought accessibility (DTA) were measured, and a COVID Index (COVID-19 cases and deaths on date of participation) was produced. The COVID Index was positively related to DTA. Additionally, DTA mediated the relationship between the COVID Index and depression scores when participants had low levels of self-esteem. These findings suggest that heightened existential concerns may be a neglected factor increasing depression during the pandemic.","Fairlamb","https://doi.org/10.1177/13591053211067102","20211229","COVID-19; depression; self-esteem; terror management; well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24438,""
"Role of the Telemental Health Services During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Systematic Review","The COVID-19 pandemic has directed the use of telemedicine and digital mental health services to meet the needs of people in order to maintain physical distancing by preventing person to person contact. The aim of this review is to highlight the role of telemental health services during the COVID-19 pandemic. An electronic search was carried out between January 01, 2020 and October 31, 2020 to explore the utilization of telehealth services for mental health problems among adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary source of literature was the structured search of major electronic databases from the MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL Plus, Science Direct and the Web of Science. We included nine published studies meeting the the eligibility criteria. The role of telehealth identified in this review mainly focused on the applicability of this modality for assessing and managing various mental health problems in these unprecedented times. It also pointed out that the provision of telemental health support reduced the burden of mental health diseases and promoted the wellbeing of the individual. Further, it was witnessed that patients preferred remote consultation as compared to face-to-face visits in order to avoid contracting the virus and found online mental health interventions and psychological counseling very helpful to cope up with the current crisis. The current COVID-19 lockdown has changed the management of the mental health problems of patients.

"Impact of COVID-19 on Saudi Children: Special Focus on Behavioral, Social, and Emotional Aspects, 2020-2021","Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has negatively affected many aspects of daily life. In Saudi Arabia, many studies, using a range of assessment approaches, have examined how the pandemic has affected the mental health of both the general public and healthcare workers. However, to develop effective public-health initiatives for such crisis events, it would also be relevant to determine the pandemic's impact on the behavioral, emotional, and social lives of Saudi children. Objective To assess, among Saudi children aged 3-15 years, the behavioral, emotional, and social changes that have occurred in their daily lives due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Materials and methods This study featured a cross-sectional design. Potential participants were approached through the most popular social media in Saudi Arabia, and the final sample size was 651 parents. As, at the time of data collection, the members of the Saudi public were requested to avoid face-to-face meetings where possible, a well-designed electronic questionnaire featuring closed-ended questions was used. Results Descriptive statistics showed that the mean age of the parents was 29Ã‚Â±7 years (range: 20-60 years); over half (58%) were female. During the COVID-19 outbreak, one-third of children had asked to sleep in their parents' beds. Furthermore, approximately 30% of children demonstrated increased irritability and mood swings when compared with the period before the pandemic. Concerning adaptive social behaviors, during the pandemic, 22% of children appeared calmer and 14% of children seemed more thoughtful. Our study reports more screen time, less physical activity, and reduced sleep time among children compared with the pre-pandemic period. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has psychologically affected children. The present results highlight the need to reduce this psychological burden by enhancing children's emotional resilience and involving parents in health-promotion programs aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of such public-health crises.","Almugti, Alotaibi, Almohammed, Abuhadi, Baeshen, Alharthi, Alsharari, Alotaibi, Omar, Alturki, Oberi, Alrehaili, Alzahrani, Alghanim, Ayoub","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.19856","20211229","behavioral; covid-19; emotional; saudi children; social","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24443,""
"Impact of COVID-19 on Children's and Adolescent's Mental Health in Saudi Arabia","Background COVID-19Ã‚Â outbreak was sudden and unexpected in most countries. It has spread globally between January and March 2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) first declared the outbreak as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020. While this lockdown has proven to be an important and successful method of social distancing to counter the growing spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 virus, it has also created a degree of psychological impact on the public. Children may be strongly exposed to pandemic-generated biopsychosocial stressors, and once the containment measures of the population are needed to minimize the spread of viruses, they may be negatively impacted by the disturbance of everyday life as a result of social isolation. During school closures, children's routines may change, and healthy behaviors, such as physical activity, adequate diet, or good sleeping habits, may be less likely to happen. Method A cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from 20 March 2021 to 30 MarchÃ‚Â 2021, targeted at children's parents and adolescents. Our concentration was on the impact of COVID-19 on the psychiatric wellbeing of children and adolescents. The data was collected through an online self-administered questionnaire which contains 56 close-ended questions for parents of children and 46Ã‚Â close-ended questions for adolescents. Statistical analysis was performed using R v 3.6.3 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). Counts and percentages were used to summarize the distribution of categorical variables. Results The questionnaire was completed by 1141 respondents, 454 were &lt; 18 years old. Thus, these respondents completed the questionnaire on behalf of themselves. The remaining 688 respondents were adults and completed the questionnaire on behalf of their children. Results showed that higher children's age was associated with less increase in worrying, restlessness, and a higher increase in sadness. Higher age was associated with a higher increase in the frequency of waking up, sleeping little, and uneasiness, and nervousness. Having relatives who were infected with COVID-19 was associated with higher increases in most of the negative behaviors such as anxiety, sadness, sleeping little, indecisiveness, and irritability. Punishment threats, screaming, and hitting were associated with a higher increase in negative behaviors during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. Results showed that neither the gender of the parent nor the child was associated with any of the domains of the child's behavior. Children whose parents were divorced had higher scores on anxiety, restlessness, and sleep disorders than children whose parents were not divorced Conclusion COVID-19 has caused increased stress on families, especially children and adolescents who are vulnerable populations. Our results show that the COVID-19 pandemic can affect the mental health of children and adolescents in Saudi Arabia. We showed that parental stress is a predictor of psychiatric problems, which, if unaddressed, can cause child maltreatment and greater psychological distress.","Almhizai, Almogren, Altwijery, Alanazi, Al Dera, Alzahrani, Alabdulkarim","https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.19786","20211229","adolescents; children; covid-19; mental health; saudi arabia","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24444,""
"The relationship between text message sentiment and self-reported depression","Personal sensing has shown promise for detecting behavioral correlates of depression, but there is little work examining personal sensing of cognitive and affective states. Digital language, particularly through personal text messages, is one source that can measure these markers. We correlated privacy-preserving sentiment analysis of text messages with self-reported depression symptom severity. We enrolled 219 U.S. adults in a 16 week longitudinal observational study. Participants installed a personal sensing app on their phones, which administered self-report PHQ-8 assessments of their depression severity, collected phone sensor data, and computed anonymized language sentiment scores from their text messages. We also trained machine learning models for predicting end-of-study self-reported depression status using on blocks of phone sensor and text features. In correlation analyses, we find that degrees of depression, emotional, and personal pronoun language categories correlate most strongly with self-reported depression, validating prior literature. Our classification models which predict binary depression status achieve a leave-one-out AUC of 0.72 when only considering text features and 0.76 when combining text with other networked smartphone sensors. Participants were recruited from a panel that over-represented women, caucasians, and individuals with self-reported depression at baseline. As language use differs across demographic factors, generalizability beyond this population may be limited. The study period also coincided with the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, which may have affected smartphone sensor data quality. Effective depression prediction through text message sentiment, especially when combined with other personal sensors, could enable comprehensive mental health monitoring and intervention.","Liu, Meyerhoff, Eichstaedt, Karr, Kaiser, Kording, Mohr, Ungar","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.12.048","20211229","Depression; digital phenotyping; language sentiment analysis; machine learning; personal sensing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24445,""
"Maternal-fetal bonding during the COVID-19 pandemic","The pregnant population experienced unique COVID-19 physical and psychosocial stressors such as direct health concerns related to the virus and loss of access to resources since the COVID-19 emerged as a global pandemic in early 2020. Despite these COVID-19-related stress and concerns, the maternal experience of bonding with their unborn children has not been well studied. This work aimed to study the association between mental health history, current mental health symptoms, psychological factors, COVID-19-related worries, and self-reported maternal-fetal bonding of pregnant women. This online, survey-based cross-sectional study focused on women pregnant during the pandemic and assessed 686 women using data collected from May 19, 2020 to October 3, 2020. Enrolled respondents completed assessments in which they self-reported maternal-fetal bonding, mental health symptomatology, psychological factors, and COVID-19-related worries regarding health, pregnancy, and resources. Depressive symptoms in pregnant women were associated with lower quality maternal-fetal bonding, while a higher level of anxiety was positively associated with bonding; however, past history of depression or generalized anxiety diagnosis did not appear to be as relevant as active symptomatology. Maternal resilience, but not distress tolerance, appeared to be a protective factor resulting in improved bonding. Higher levels of worry regarding impact of COVID-19 on health were significantly associated with improved bonding, while worries regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the pregnancy or resources were not significantly associated with bonding. The study also found associations between different sociodemographic variables and bonding, including a strong positive association between first time motherhood and bonding and a negative association between higher education and income and bonding. This study was the first to report potential protective and risk factors to the maternal-fetal bonding process in women pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unique COVID-19 concerns exist; however, anxiety and COVID-19 concerns do not appear to undermine maternal-fetal bonding while active depressive symptomatology may negatively influence bonding; interventions increasing maternal resilience may be particularly valuable.","Koire, Mittal, Erdei, Liu","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04272-9","20211229","Anxiety; Attachment; Depression; Distress; Life events; Mental health; Parenting; Pregnancy; Resilience; Stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24446,""
"Psychological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on one-month postpartum mothers in a metropolitan area of Japan","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has recently become the most important issue in the world. Very few reports in Japan have examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on peripartum mental health. We examined the status of postpartum mental health before and during COVID-19 pandemic from a consecutive database in a metropolitan area of Japan. The subjects were women who had completed a maternity health check-up at a core regional hospital in Yokohama during the period from April 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. We collected the subjects' scores for the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale (MIBS) at 1Ã‚Â month postpartum. The subjects were divided into four groups (three Before COVID-19 groups and a During COVID-19 group). MANOVA and post-hoc tests were used to determine mental health changes in the postpartum period among the four groups. The Before and During COVID-19 groups contained 2844 and 1095 mothers, respectively. There were no significant difference in the total scores of the EPDS and MIBS among the four groups. However, the EPDS items related to anxiety factors were significantly higher and the EPDS items related to anhedonia and depression factors (excluding thoughts of self-harm) were significantly lower in the During COVID-19 group. The EPDS scores changed in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, which represent hypervigilance, was significantly higher and anhedonia and depression were significantly lower in the During COVID-19 group. Our results may reflect COVID-19-related health concerns and a lack of social support caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Takubo, Tsujino, Aikawa, Fukiya, Iwai, Uchino, Ito, Akiba, Mizuno, Nemoto","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-021-04331-1","20211229","Anxiety; COVID-19; Japan; Postnatal depression; Postpartum","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24447,""
"Creating Comics to Address Well-Being and Resilience During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In this descriptive case series, we detail the theoretical basis, methodology, and impact of a small-scale pilot implementation of graphic medicine workshops as an innovative approach to well-being and resilience in the age of COVID-19 and increasing awareness of racial injustice. The data provided in this article are anecdotal and based on participation in the workshops. Images created during the workshops are also shared as examples of the types of reflection that graphic medicine can enable. The workshops themselves were designed collaboratively and are based on the theoretical principles of graphic medicine, narrative medicine, and racial and social justice. They were conducted as part of a larger wellness initiative and were offered to health care-focused faculty at our academic medical institution. Our findings suggest that this was a beneficial activity which helped participants to reflect and reconsider their experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic and surging awareness of racial injustice. Reflections also showed that drawings were correlated with ProQOL scores and may, in larger numbers, also help to mitigate or bring attention to issues of burnout in frontline providers. Drawings shared show the tremendous impact of COVID-19 and the simultaneous chaos and emptiness of practicing during dual pandemics. Our workshops engaged about 20 frontline health care providers and other health care faculty and highlight the utility of graphic medicine as a tool for building resilience and encouraging self-reflection. Further study is necessary, as is more rigorous analysis of the relationship between the graphics created and the ability to recognize and mitigate burnout.","West, Jackson, Spears, Callender","https://doi.org/10.1177/15248399211065407","20211229","access to health care; community intervention; health equity; health promotion; mental health; resource development; social determinants of health; social marketing / health communication; workforce development","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24448,""
"Monitoring Australian parents' shifting receptiveness to digital mental health interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic","Nascent evidence indicates that the mental health of parents and children has markedly declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering disruptions to traditional face-to-face mental health services resultant from stay-at-home orders, the potential value of digital mental health interventions has become extremely apparent. Despite this, uptake of digital interventions remains poor, indicating that a better understanding is needed of factors that determine a willingness to use digital platforms. The present multi-wave, longitudinal study of 2365 Australian parents explored between-person and within-person predictors of intentions to use digital interventions during the pandemic. More than one-third of parents reported likely use of a self-guided and therapist-guided digital intervention, with the most endorsed reason for use being to support their child's mental health. Between-person baseline predictors of higher intention ratings were parent's prior mental illness, not living with a partner and recent environmental stressors. Within-person predictors of higher intention ratings were endorsement of mindful parenting strategies, child access to the Internet, better perceived management of child's education, lower social support and financial hardship. Findings demonstrate that willingness to engage in digital interventions fluctuates in response to changing circumstances. Identifying novel ways to increase acceptance and uptake of digital interventions based on modifiable predictors established here is needed to realize the full potential of these modes of care in times of need.","Linardon, Westrupp, Macdonald, Mikocka-Walus, Stokes, Greenwood, Youssef, Teague, Hutchinson, Sciberras, Fuller-Tyszkiewicz","https://doi.org/10.1177/00048674211065985","20211229","Australia; COVID-19 pandemic; Digital intervention; digital health; families; mental health; parent","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-12-30","",24449,""
