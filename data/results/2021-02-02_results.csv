"Impact of COVID-19 on search in an organisation","COVID-19 has created unprecedented organisational challenges, yet no study has examined the impact on information search  A case study in a knowledge-intensive organisation was undertaken on 2 5?million search queries during the pandemic  A surge of unique users and COVID-19 search queries in March 2020 may equate to ?peak uncertainty and activity?, demonstrating the importance of corporate search engines in times of crisis  Search volumes dropped 24% after lockdowns;an ?L-shaped? recovery may be a surrogate for business activity  COVID-19 search queries transitioned from awareness, to impact, strategy, response and ways of working that may influence future search design  Low click through rates imply some information needs were not met and searches on mental health increased  In extreme situations (i e  a pandemic), companies may need to move faster, monitoring and exploiting their enterprise search logs in real time as these reflect uncertainty and anxiety that may exist in the enterprise","Cleverley, Paul H.; Cousins, Fionnuala, Burnett, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1177/0165551521989531","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Information Science;: 0165551521989531, 2021.; Publication details: Journal of Information Science;: 0165551521989531, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10095,""
"Intersectional trauma: COVID-19, the psychosocial contract, and America's racialized public health lineage","This comparative review explores how, during COVID-19 and recent American public health disasters, including the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, Hurricane Katrina, and Hurricane Maria, early failures in public health communications, porous epidemiologic oversight, and lax crisis management created significant gaps in outreach and treatment for historically disenfranchised racial/ethnic minorities  In consideration of each event's broader specter in terms of population health inequities, a highly salient but underresearched dynamic emerges: the development of heightened psychological sequelae including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress, factors linked to civic and health care system disengagement and poorer overall health  This excess mental illness morbidity can be said to fall under the umbrella of intersectional trauma, or psychological harm and psychosocial vulnerability produced through the accumulation of cultural, political, economic, and ecologic stressors tied to salient identity markers such as race or ethnicity  During COVID-19, reports have presaged race- and class-specific disparities in infections and mortality, with evidence highlighting adverse effects on the ""psychosocial contract,"" public trust and faith in government and health care systems which is borne from relational experiences tied to one's identity markers  We discuss how COVID-19's kinetic and fluid political dynamics may add to the burden of mental illness and trauma in racial/ethnic minority communities in the United States and further entrench said disparities, closing with potential strategies for mitigation  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Ezell, Jerel M.; Salari, Samira, Rooker, Clinton, Chase, Elizabeth C.","https://doi.org/10.1037/trm0000302","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Traumatology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Traumatology;: No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10096,""

"Clozapine, neutropenia and Covid-19: should clinicians be concerned? 3 months report","Background Clozapine is among the most effective antipsychotic used for treatment resistant schizophrenia  Adverse reactions to clozapine include neutropenia  In March 2020, at the start of the Coronavirus -19 pandemic, clinicians raised concerns regarding continuation of antipsychotic treatment, and specifically of clozapine, in patients with coronavirus disease  We aimed here at providing a short report focusing on the association between neutropenia and clozapine in a case series of psychiatric inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19  Patients & Methods We retrospectively inspected data of 10 patients on clozapine, admitted to Highgate Mental Health Centre -Camden & Islington NHS Foundation Trust between March and July 2020;selection was based on their COVID-19 positive PCR test  We used a linear regression model to estimate whether there was a significant drop in the neutrophil count during SARS-CoV-2 infection  The analysis was done in R using a linear regression to the origin  Results Data were collected on 10 patients, of which 7 were males  During COVID-19 infection, neutrophilsâ€™ count (ANC) 4 13 Ã— 109/l (SD = 2 70) from a baseline value of 5 2 Ã— 109/l (SD = 2 24)  The mean relative reduction in ANC was -0 2729 (SD = 0 1666)  The beta value of 0 8377 obtained with the linear regression showed that ANC values during SARS-CoV-2 infection were 83 77% of the baseline ANC showing that within the two time points there was a decrease in ANC of 16 23%  The linear regression had a pvalue = 8 96 x 10-8 and an adjusted R2 of 95 94% which shows that the variability of the data is very well explained by the model  We also compared baseline ANC with ANC values approximately a month after resolution of the infection and results indicate that ANC values return to a 95% of baseline  Conclusions Clinicians should bear in mind that a significant drop in neutrophilsâ€™ count may occur in patients taking clozapine and affected from a SARS-CoV-2 infection and that this drop is only transitory","Bonaccorso, Stefania, Ricciardi, Angelo, Ouabbou, Sophie, Theleritis, Christos, Ross-Michealides, Arabella, Metastasio, Antonio, Stewart, Neil, Mohammed, Marwa, Schifano, Fabrizio","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbih.2021.100212","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health;: 100212, 2021.; Publication details: Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health;: 100212, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10110,""

"Helping parents cultivate social capital in educational settings to achieve equal opportunities and justice for African American students","African American children and youth fail to achieve the same level of academic success as their White peers  They receive a disproportionate number of suspensions and expulsions and are not provided with equal access to academically rigorous coursework  In the state of California, less than one-third of African American students who graduate from high school meet the minimum requirements for admission to a California State University or University of California college  Research shows implicit bias is responsible for disproportionate discipline and lower academic expectations for African American students (Wood, Harris, & Howard, 2018)  Implicit bias is also an underlying cause of microaggressions, and the resulting racial trauma experienced by African American students in schools and classrooms across the nation (Gattis & Larson, 2017;Meyer, 2003;Weir, 2016)  Left untreated, these traumas can result in mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression (Trent, Dooley, & Douge, 2019) One of the 12 Grand Challenges for Social Work (Barth et al , 2019) is to achieve equal opportunity and justice   To address issues of educational injustice and inequities, and to bring attention to the unmet mental health needs of African American youth, the author developed a parent engagement program, BLACK INK  BLACK INK stands for Building Leaders and Advocating College for Kids via Interdependent Networking and Knowledge  The BLACK INK program is designed to help parents learn how to navigate school systems, build and cultivate social capital, increase understanding of academic and developmental expectations and milestones, advocate for equal educational opportunities, and better understand mental health and its implications for their children  This information will ensure parents and caregivers are well-equipped to advocate on behalf of their children Current and past discriminatory practices have caused many African American parents to shy away from schools  Parents are jaded and distrustful of a system in which they have been treated unfairly  As a result, too few African American parents take an active role at school or hold teachers and administrators accountable for providing their children with a fair and equitable education  The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, 2015) demands schools include parents in the decision-making process  Many parents are unaware of this mandate  BLACK INK will teach parents how to navigate school systems and use the power of their voices to make positive changes for their students  The goal of BLACK INK is to increase parent engagement within the school and to create a network of advocates who will work together to support African American students in the quest for equal educational opportunities  Academic success and the attainment of a college education can change the lives of an entire family  A degree can open the door to better-paying jobs and provide access to safer neighborhoods and well-resourced schools  BLACK INK will arm parents and students with tools and information to place students on a successful path  The pilot program will provide valuable information about best practices and will serve as a roadmap for the delivery of services beyond local school districts  As the United States struggles to meet the challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic, the mental health needs of the nation's youth is on the minds of parents, teachers, and school administrators, all of whom are eager to have students return to the classroom  Social isolation, civil unrest, and uncertainty about the future have challenged the mental health of all members of the society  African Americans, who contend with the additional social tax of being Black, are especially vulnerable  The innovation of this project, which seeks to provide a mental health training module for parents, could not be timelier  (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","Stevens-Parker, Sheri Kim","https://www.google.com/search?q=Helping+parents+cultivate+social+capital+in+educational+settings+to+achieve+equal+opportunities+and+justice+for+African+American+students","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering;82(4-B):No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication details: Dissertation Abstracts International: Section B: The Sciences and Engineering;82(4-B):No Pagination Specified, 2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10112,""

"Scoring the financial distress and the financial statement fraud of Garuda Indonesia with Â«DDCCÂ» as the financial solutions","Purpose: PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA) Persero Tbk is the one only pride airline of Indonesian sovereignty  Although the bird achieved abundant international awards and certifications, the bird is dying and needs a remedy immediately  The frequent annual turnover of board executives did not make impact to the financial performance;this seems to be tip of the iceberg, peculiar with the number of restatement over the past decade  Therefore, this paper aims to address the issue through the function of five red flags model which known as Altman Z-score, Sprigate S-score, Grover G-score, Beneish M-score and Dechow F-score  Design/methodology/approach: This is exploratory study of univariate analysis using financial distress and fraudulent financial statement approach, while the type of data is secondary taken from Indonesia Stock Exchange during 12 years observation from 2007 to 2018  Findings: Altman, Springate and Grover produce strong indication of GIAAâ€™s financial distress;all models score the same distress indication by 14 times  All distress models agreed that only 2011 and 2012 classify to the safe zone when GIAA performed the corporate actions  Beneish scores fraud indication by eight times  Dechow scores slightly higher by nine times  The number of fraud predictions in this research are in line with the number of restatement, which proves the assumption that restatement can be used as a signal of the financial statement fraud  When GIAA categorized in safe zone, both Beneish and Dechow score no to fraud, this indicates the fraud occurence during health period is lower  Research limitations/implications: The motivation behind the financial statement fraud is not discuss through this research but from the primary theory of the fraud triangle  Financial distress possesses strong relationship with pressure factor;therefore, exit from financial crisis is one of the best solution to mitigate the financial statement fraud  Practical implications: The average of Beneish score is -2,26, slightly above the manipulator threshold which is -2,22  This must be marked as an ample conjecture of GIAAâ€™s fraud inclination and been a highlight for the auditor both internal and external when performing control testing, attestation and other assurance services  Social implications: All models in this study can apply to any other corporate issues, especially for evaluating the government company who has loosen the public trust recently in Indonesia such as PT Asuransi Jiwasraya and PT Asabri  Moreover, the pandemic COVID-19 has brought the world to the new unprecedented risk, especially the economic turmoil which lead the possibilities of corporate distress and fraud  By applying these scores, public might have tools as pre-elemenary assessment to serve a decision where to put trust in a company  Originality/value: This paper reveals a combination from various models of financial distress and financial statement fraud in order to generate the financial solutions named Â« DDCC Â» Debt Restructuring, Debt Conversion, Capex Management and Cost Cutting  Â© 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited","Aviantara, R.","https://doi.org/10.1108/JM2-01-2020-0017","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Journal of Modelling in Management;2021.; Publication details: Journal of Modelling in Management;2021.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10127,""

"Personality traits and the perception of the COVID-19 pandemic","The study examined dispositional personality traits identified in the six-factor HEXACO model and their involvement in the perception of various aspects of the pandemic  It was hypothesized that (1) the role of personality traits in experiencing the pandemic of COVID-19 and related hardships could be viewed as a predisposition to a certain type of reaction;(2) this predisposition could be identified by comparing extreme groups (respondents with diametrically opposed responses to the situation caused by the pandemic)  This article presents the results of correlation and moderation analysis, and a comparison of extreme groups  The study was conducted during the first three weeks of the lockdown in Russia  The participants were undergraduate and graduate students from different fields (technical studies, natural sciences and humanities) residing in 15 cities in the European part of Russia  The sample included 667 participants aged 16-31 (M = 20 44, SD = 2 38);74 2% of the participants were females  Respondents filled out two online questionnaires  The first related to perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic, the second was a brief HEXACO inventory  The results obtained are as follows  High levels of Honesty/Humility, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness can be viewed as predictors of successful adaptation to the stressful situation caused by COVID-19, since fust of all these personality traits contribute to recognition of the need for quarantine and thus reduce the likelihood of individuals infecting themselves and those around them;second, they are not associated with a feeling of hopelessness;and third, they help individuals adapt during the period of quarantine (at the veiy least, during the initial period of isolation that the study focused on)  High levels of Emotionality had the reverse effect  This trait is associated with increased anxiety and, on one hand, can promote the recognition of the need for quarantine but, on the other, makes complying with quarantine measures more difficult  High Extroversion is also a risk factor  Individuals with high levels of Extroversion don't do well with isolation and tend to be skeptical about the veiy existence of the pandemic, believing either that its dangers are exaggerated, or that the pandemic is a hoax, which makes them more likely to violate quarantine measures and increases the probability of infection  Â© 2020 Rossiiskaya Akademiya Obrazovaniya  All rights reserved","Egorova, M.

"What We Have Learned from Two Decades of Epidemics and Pandemics: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Psychological Burden of Frontline Healthcare Workers","In light of the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and potential future infectious disease outbreaks, a comprehensive understanding of the negative effects of epidemics and pandemics on healthcare workers' mental health could inform appropriate support interventions. Thus, we aimed to synthesize and quantify the psychological and psychosomatic symptoms among frontline medical staff. We searched four databases up to March 19, 2020 and additional literature, with daily search alerts set up until October 26, 2020. Studies reporting psychological and/or psychosomatic symptoms of healthcare workers caring for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, H1N1, Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome, or COVID-19 were eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently conducted the search, study selection, quality appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis and involved a third reviewer in case of disagreement. We used random effects modeling to estimate the overall prevalence rates of psychological/psychosomatic symptoms and the I2 statistic. We included 86 studies, reporting data from 75,991 participants. Frontline staff showed a wide range of symptoms, including concern about transmitting the virus to the family (60.39%, 95% CI 42.53-76.96), perceived stress (56.77%, 95% CI 34.21-77.95), concerns about own health (45.97%, 95% CI 31.08-61.23), sleeping difficulties (39.88%, 95% CI 27.70-52.72), burnout (31.81%, 95% CI 13.32-53.89), symptoms of depression (25.72%, 95% CI 18.34-33.86), symptoms of anxiety (25.36%, 95% CI 17.90-33.64), symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (24.51%, 95% CI 18.16-31.46), mental health issues (23.11%, 95% CI 15.98-31.10), and symptoms of somatization (14.68%, 95% CI 10.67-19.18).

"Exposure to Coronavirus Disease-Related Information and Mental Health Problems: A Nationwide Cross-sectional Survey in Thailand","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a negative impact on both the physical and mental health of individuals worldwide. Evidence regarding the association between mental health problems and information exposure in Thai citizens during the COVID-19 outbreak is limited. This study aimed to explore the relationship between information exposure and mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic in Thailand. Between April 21, 2020 and May 4, 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional, nationwide online survey of the general population in Thailand. We categorized the duration of exposure to COVID-19-related information as &lt;1 h/day (reference group), 1-2 h/day, and Ã¢â€°Â¥3 h/day. Mental health outcomes were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Perceived Stress Scale, and Insomnia Severity Index for symptoms of depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between information exposure and the risk of developing the aforementioned symptoms. An ancillary analysis using multivariable multinomial logistic regression models was also conducted to assess the possible dose-response relationship across the severity strata of mental health problems. Of the 4,322 participants, 4,004 (92.6%) completed the online survey. Of them, 1,481 (37.0%), 1,644 (41.1%), and 879 (22.0%) participants were exposed to COVID-19-related information for &lt;1 h/day, 1-2 h/day, and Ã¢â€°Â¥3 h/day, respectively. The major source of information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was social media (95.3%), followed by traditional media (68.7%) and family members (34.9%). Those exposed to information for Ã¢â€°Â¥3 h/day had a higher risk of developing symptoms of depression (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.76; P=0.031), anxiety (adjusted OR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.43-2.46; P&lt;0.001) and insomnia (adjusted OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-1.97; P=0.001) than people exposed to information for &lt;1 h/day. Meanwhile, people exposed to information for 1-2 h/day were only at risk of developing symptoms of anxiety (adjusted OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.08-1.69; P=0.008). However, no association was found between information exposure and the risk of perceived stress. In the ancillary analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between information exposure for Ã¢â€°Â¥3 h/day and the severity of mental health problems. These findings suggest that social media is the main source of COVID-19 related information. Moreover, people who are exposed to information for Ã¢â€°Â¥3 h/day are more likely to develop psychological problems, including depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Longitudinal studies investigating the long-term effects of COVID-19-related information exposure on mental health are warranted.","Mongkhon, Ruengorn, Awiphan, Thavorn, Hutton, Wongpakaran, Wongpakaran, Nochaiwong","https://doi.org/10.2196/25363","20210201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10137,""
"Consuming information related to COVID-19 on social media among older adults and its associations with anxiety, social trust in information, and COVID-safe behaviours: Cross-Sectional Survey","COVID-19-related information on social media is overabundant and sometimes questionable, resulting in an &quot;infodemic&quot; during the pandemic. While previous studies suggest social media usage increases the risk of developing anxiety symptoms, how induced anxiety affects attitudes and behaviours is less discussed, let alone during a global pandemic. Little is known about the relationship between older adults using social media during a pandemic and their anxiety, the attitudes in social trust in information, and behaviours to avoid contracting COVID-19. To investigate the associations between using social media for COVID-19-related information and anxiety symptoms and the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms on social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviours among older adults. A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong between May and August 2020. A rapid warm-call protocol was developed to train social workers and volunteers from participant NGOs to conduct the telephone survey. Questions related to COVID-safe behaviours, social trust in information, social media use, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic information were asked. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the community level was used to account for the risk of contracting COVID-19. OLS regressions examined the associations between social media use and anxiety symptoms, and how they were associated with social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviours. Structural equation modelling further mapped out these relationships to identify the mediation effects of anxiety symptoms. This study collected information regarding 3421 adults aged 60 years and older. Use of social media for COVID-19-related information was associated with more anxiety symptoms and lower social trust in information but had no significant relationship with COVID-safe behaviours. Anxiety symptoms predicted lower social trust in information and higher COVID-safe behaviours. Lower social trust in information was predicted by using social media for COVID-19 information, mediated by anxiety symptoms, while no mediation effect was found in COVID-safe behaviours. Older adults who rely on social media for COVID-19-related information are exhibiting more anxiety symptoms, while showing mixed effects on attitudes and behaviours. Social trust in information may be challenged by unverified and contradictory information online. The negligible impact on COVID-safe behaviours suggested social media may have caused more confusion than consolidating a consistent effort against the pandemic. Media literacy education is recommended to promote critical evaluation of COVID-19-related information and responsible sharing among older adults.","Wong, Liu, Leung, Zhang, Au, Kwok, Shum, Wong, Lum","https://doi.org/10.2196/26570","20210201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10138,""
"Variation In Telemedicine Use And Outpatient Care During The COVID-19 Pandemic In The United States","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spurred a rapid rise in telemedicine, but it is unclear how use has varied by clinical and patient factors during the pandemic.

During the pandemic, 30.1Ã‚Â percent of all visits were provided via telemedicine, and the weekly number of visits increased twenty-three-fold compared with the prepandemic period. Telemedicine use was lower in communities with higher rates of poverty (31.9Ã‚Â percent versus 27.9Ã‚Â percent for the lowest and highest quartiles of poverty rate, respectively). Across specialties, the use of any telemedicine during the pandemic ranged from 68Ã‚Â percent of endocrinologists to 9Ã‚Â percent of ophthalmologists. Across common conditions, the percentage of visits provided during the pandemic via telemedicine ranged from 53Ã‚Â percent for depression to 3Ã‚Â percent for glaucoma. Higher rates of telemedicine use for common conditions were associated with smaller decreases in total weekly visits during the pandemic.","Patel, Mehrotra, Huskamp, Uscher-Pines, Ganguli, Barnett","https://doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01786","20210201","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10139,""

Data were analyzed across 5Ã‚Â months following the beginning of the pandemic (from January 13 to May 17) and compared with the same period in 2019. Data on reperfusion therapy for acute infarction stroke were extracted monthly from January to April. The number of outpatients declined from 102,300 in 2019 to 75,154 in 2020 (26.54%), while the number of inpatients in the three tertiary Grade A hospitals decreased from 4641 to 3437 (25.94%). The latter trend showed a significant drop from the 3rd week to the 7th week. The number of patients in these hospitals decreased significantly, and a significant drop was seen in the neurology department. As usual, stroke was the most common disease observed; however, anxiety/depression and insomnia increased dramatically in the outpatient consultation department. The results of our study revealed the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the clinical practice of neurology in Wenzhou during the outbreak.

"The first 8 weeks of the Austrian SARS-CoV-2 epidemic","Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoVÃ¢â‚¬â€˜2) reached Austria in February 2020. This study aims to describe the first 8 weeks of the Austrian epidemic and reflect on the potential mental health consequences as known at that time. Data on Austrian Coronavirus Disease 19Ã‚Â (COVID-19) epidemiological indicators and number of tests were obtained from official registers. Relative risks (RRs) of infection and death from COVID-19 were calculated for sex and age groups (&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯65 years and Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯65Ã‚Â years). Public health measures introduced to reduce the spread of COVID-19 were identified via online media research. AÃ‚Â rapid review of initial evidence on mental health consequences of the pandemic was performed in PubMed and medRxiv. By 21Ã‚Â April 2020 the case count in Austria was 14,810 after aÃ‚Â peak of new daily infections mid-March. The RR of death for age Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯65 years was 80.07 (95% confidence interval, CI 52.64-121.80; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001) compared to those aged &lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯65 years. In men the RR of death was 1.44 (95% CI 1.20-1.73; pÃ¢â‚¬Â¯&lt;Ã¢â‚¬Â¯0.0001) compared to women. Wide-ranging public health measures included avoidance of case importation, limitation of social contacts, hygiene measures, testing, case tracking, and the call for COVID-19-related research. International rates of psychiatric symptoms during the initial lockdowns exceeded typical levels: anxiety (6%-51%), depression (17%-48%) and posttraumatic stress (5%-54%). Data show great vulnerability of older people also in Austria. Severe mental health impacts can be expected with need for proper assessment of the long-term consequences of this pandemic.","Nagel, Ã…Âaszewska, Haidinger, Simon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00508-020-01804-9","20210201","Austria; COVID-19; Mental health; Public health measures; Relative risk","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10141,""

It is essential to also understand generational differences in psychosocial impacts to identify appropriate prevention and intervention targets. Across generational groups, this study examined: (1) rates of precautions and adaptive and maladaptive health behaviors, (2) differences in levels of anxiety, and (3) rates of COVID-related concerns during Wave 1 of COVID-19 in Canada. We analyzed data from 2 Canadian population-based data sets: the Canadian Perspective Survey Series: Impact of COVID-19 survey (<i>N</i> = 4,627; March 29 to April 3, 2020), and Crowdsourcing: Impacts of COVID-19 on Canadians-Your Mental Health (<i>N</i> = 45,989; April 24 to May 11, 2020). We categorized generational age group. Participants self-reported changes in behaviors and COVID-related concerns, and a validated measure assessed anxiety symptoms. There are generational differences in behavioral responses to the pandemic. Adaptive health habits (e.g., exercise) were comparable across groups, while changes in maladaptive health habits (e.g., substance use) were highest among younger age groups, particularly Millennials (15 to 34 years old). COVID-related precautions were also highest among the younger generations, with Generation X (35 to 54 years old) exhibiting the highest rate of precautionary behavior. Results also revealed that the highest rate of clinically significant anxiety is among Millennials (36.0%; severe anxiety = 15.7%), and the younger generations have the highest rates of COVID-related concerns. These early data are essential in understanding at-risk groups given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its potential long-term implications.","El-Gabalawy, Sommer","https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743721989162","20210201","COVID-19; anxiety; epidemiology; generational impacts; health behavior; mental health; pandemic; precautionary behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10142,""
"Worry during the initial height of the COVID-19 crisis in an Italian sample","In the earliest months of 2020, the COVID-19 emergency reached a pandemic status of international concern. In this situation, people tended to think more about current difficulties and their negative consequences due to the fear of infection and changed daily life during quarantine. The aim of this study was to explore the severity of worry in relation to individual characteristics and emotions during COVID-19 outbreak in the Italian people. Socio-demographic questions and standardized self-report questionnaires were administered online. Results highlighted a moderate level of worry, anxiety and distress. People with higher perceptions of COVID-19 severity exhibited higher levels of worry in contrast to those who perceived a greater control over the possibility of infection. Multiple regression analysis indicated that coping styles, emotion regulation strategies and personality traits significantly contributed to explain the variance in worry scores. Findings supported that cognitive reappraisal, emotion-focused coping and extraversion were protective factors for worry, while expressive suppression, dysfunctional and problem-focused coping, and neuroticism were related to high worry. However, neuroticism and dysfunctional coping were particularly important predictors of worry. This paper also considers possible psychological interventions that might be implemented in order to deal with mental health issues emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sebri, Cincidda, Savioni, Ongaro, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.1080/00221309.2021.1878485","20210201","Anxiety; COVID-19; coping; emotion regulation; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10143,""

Demographic information was captured and clinical data collected using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7-item (GAD-7) scale, and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Data were analysed with descriptive analysis, the chi-square test, and logistic regression. Responders showed an increase in prevalence rates for passive death wish and thoughts of self-harm compared to baseline Canadian statistics on suicidality. Responders aged Ã¢Â©Â½25years, Indigenous, had less than high school education, unemployed, single, living with family, with increased anxiety, disordered sleep, and recent concerns about germs and contamination were at greatest risk.

"Using the 'shit' of the current COVID-19 crisis as fertiliser for the soil to lay the foundations of a new and sustainable era: lessons from past crises to improve the future","Studies of past crises have demonstrated that adverse experiences during critical periods of human development hamper the individual's ability to reach its full potential and leaves lasting marks on health, behaviour, productivity and society as a whole. The COVID-19 crisis has severely worsened the environment in which we live and in which our future generations are being shaped, and will lead to loss of future human potential and capital. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic does not only harm the current world population, but also affects our future, as well as that of future generations. The science of transgenerational plasticity demonstrates that investments in early life hold the promise of having beneficial effects across multiple generations. As governments are reopening societies and prioritising policies, their overarching goal should be to improve the environment in which future generations grow and develop, learn and live. This will change the lifetime trajectories of children for the better and affect future health, school success, behaviour, productivity and well-being. This prioritisation will prove to be the most effective intervention to build sustainable futures but will also yield returns many times the original investment. It is a promising way to break the intergenerational cycle of adversity and accelerate progress on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.","Roseboom","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000122","20210201","malnutrition; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10148,""
"Misalignment of global COVID-19 breastfeeding and newborn care guidelines with World Health Organization recommendations","Recommendations for the clinical management of new mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 and their infants are required. Guidance must weigh the risk posed by transmission of SARS-CoV-2 against the protection that maternal proximity and breastfeeding provide infants. Our aim was to review international COVID-19 guidance for maternal and newborn care, assessing alignment with WHO recommendations and the extent to which policy supported or undermined breastfeeding. Guidance documents from 33 countries on the care of infants whose mothers were suspected or confirmed as having COVID-19 were assessed for alignment with WHO recommendations regarding: (1) skin-to-skin contact; (2) early initiation of breastfeeding; (3); rooming-in; (4) direct breastfeeding; (5) provision of expressed breastmilk; (6) provision of donor human milk; (7) wet nursing; (8) provision of breastmilk substitutes; (9) psychological support for separated mothers; and (10) psychological support for separated infants. Considerable inconsistency in recommendations were found. Recommendations against practices supportive of breastfeeding were common, even in countries with high infant mortality rates. None of the guidance documents reviewed recommended all aspects of WHO guidance. The presence of influential guidance conflicting with WHO recommendations and an undervaluing of the importance of maternal proximity and breastfeeding to infant health appeared to contribute to this poor alignment. Those developing guidance in the COVID-19 pandemic and other infectious disease outbreaks need to appropriately consider the importance of skin-to-skin contact, early initiation of breastfeeding, rooming-in and breastfeeding to maternal and infant physical and psychological health. In weighing the value of recommendations of others in future guidance development, countries should consider past reliability and value placed on breastfeeding. Recommendations against maternal proximity and breastfeeding should not be made without compelling evidence that they are necessary, and less harmful than maintaining dyad integrity.","Vu Hoang, Cashin, Gribble, Marinelli, Mathisen","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjnph-2020-000184","20210201","malnutrition; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10149,""

To investigate the impacts of the COVID-19-induced lockdown in Zimbabwe on nutrition, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking among Zimbabwean population aged Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted using a structured questionnaire to collect information on demographics (age, gender, place of residence, current employment), food system dimensions, diet and physical activity patterns, stress and anxiety, body image perceptions, lifestyle behaviours like smoking, alcohol intake, screen time and ease of access to health services. <b>Results</b> The participants (n=507) were mostly women (63.0%) between the ages of 31 and 40 years (48.1%) and had tertiary education (91.3%). The lockdown resulted in increase in food prices (94.8%) and decrease in availability of nutritious foods (64%). Most (62.5%) of the participants reported a reduction in their physical activity levels. The prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) was 40.4% and mostly affecting woman (63.5%, p=0.909), 31-40 years age group (49.6%, p=0.886). Based on the Body Mass Index-based Silhouette Matching Test (BMI-SMT) 44.5% gained weight, 24.3% lost weight and 31.2% did not have weight change.

"Rising to the challenge: medical students as Doctors' Assistants; an evaluation of a new clinical role","The COVID-19 Pandemic brought clinical placements to a halt for many UK medical students. A University Hospitals Trust offered clinical phase students the opportunity to support the National Health Service (NHS) in newly defined roles as Doctors' Assistants (DAs). This study evaluates the experience of students working in a single NHS Trust. To our knowledge, this is the first report of medical students' perspectives on taking up a novel clinical role in the UK. An anonymised novel electronic survey was sent to all 40 DAs across a single University Hospitals Trust via email to determine student perceptions of several aspects of the role, including its value to learning and development, impact on well-being, and benefit to the clinical environment. A formal statistical analysis was not required. Of the total cohort participating in the programme, 32 DAs responded (80% response rate). The experience was considered valuable to multiple aspects of learning and development, particularly familiarisation with the role of a Foundation doctor. Levels of confidence in training and support were high, and most DAs felt valued as part of the clinical team, and experienced no mental health issues resulting from their role. 53% of the participants felt their work was necessary or valuable to the team, and all reported a positive experience overall. A new role allowed medical students to effectively provide clinical assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided immediate support to clinical teams as well as learning opportunities for the participants without detriment to their mental well-being, and could be a model for effective retention of medical students in clinical environments in the face of resurgence of COVID-19.","Lavender, Dekker, Tambe","https://doi.org/10.30476/jamp.2020.87764.1320","20210201"," COVID-19;  Doctors' assistants;  Medical education;  Medical students;  Pandemic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10151,""
"Different Correlates of COVID-19-Related Adherent and Dysfunctional Safety Behavior","<b>Introduction:</b> Safety behaviors are key elements in reducing the spread of the COVID-19 virus, but have also assumed excessive proportions in form of panic buying groceries. This raises the question whether these behaviors are independent or related to each other. Adherent safety behavior including increased hygiene and physical distancing appears inherently adherent and prosocial, while dysfunctional safety behavior such as panic buying most probably emerges from other motives and contextual variables. <b>Methods:</b> Data from 15,308 participants collected from March 10 to May 4, 2020, during the COVID-19 acute period in Germany, was analyzed to assess whether adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior are predicted by the same or divergent variables. Two multiple regression models are presented including various sociodemographic, trait, attitudinal, and COVID-19-specific variables as predictors. <b>Results:</b> Some variables similarly predict both, adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior. Yet, adherent safety behavior is stronger predicted by COVID-19-related fear than generalized anxiety, while a trend toward a reverse pattern emerged for dysfunctional safety behavior. Adherent safety behavior was also related to higher trust in governmental actions to face COVID-19, subjective level of information, as well as use of public media and TV to remain informed on COVID-19. Higher age was related to dysfunctional, but not adherent safety behavior. Respondents living in rural communities report more adherent safety behavior than urban dwellers. <b>Discussion:</b> Divergent psychological variables underlie adherent and dysfunctional safety behavior. This hints toward a theoretical separation with practical relevance in behavioral engineering and public health campaigning.","WeismÃƒÂ¼ller, Schweda, DÃƒÂ¶rrie, Musche, Fink, Kohler, Skoda, Teufel, BÃƒÂ¤uerle","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.625664","20210201","COVID-19; fear &amp; anxiety; mental health; panic buying; safety behavior; subjective level of information; trust in government","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10152,""

"Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic in Patients with Allergic Diseases","On March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease. Interactions between allergy-related inflammatory and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have been documented. Therefore, those who have pre-existing allergic conditions may have an increased psychiatric reaction to the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic. Identify the psychological impact of COVID-19 in patients with allergic diseases and determine if these individuals have a greater risk of presenting with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is a cross-sectional, survey-based study designed to assess the degree of symptoms of depression and the risk of PTSD using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R), respectively in allergic patients. A total of 4,106 surveys were evaluated; 1,656 (40.3%) were patients with allergic disease, and 2,450 (59.7%) were non-allergic (control) individuals. Of those with allergies, 76.6% had respiratory allergic disease including asthma and allergic rhinitis. Individuals with allergic disease reported higher scores regarding symptoms of PTSD on the IES-R scale (p = 0.052, OR 1.24 CI .99 - 1.55) as well as a higher depression risk score in the PHQ-9 questionnaire (mean 6.82 vs. 5.28) p = 0.000 z = -8.76.The allergy group presented a higher score in the IES-R questionnaire (mean 25.42 vs. 20.59), being more susceptible to presenting PTSD (p = 0.000, z = -7.774).The individuals with allergic conditions were further divided into subgroups of those with respiratory allergies such as allergic rhinitis and asthma vs those with non-respiratory allergies such as drug and food allergy, urticaria and atopic dermatitis. This subgroup analysis compares respiratory versus non-respiratory allergic patients, with similar results on the IES-R (mean 25.87 vs 23.9) p = 0.0124, z = -1.539. There was no significant difference on intrusion (p=0.061, z=-1.873) and avoidance (p=0.767, z=-0.297), but in the hyperarousal subscale, patients with respiratory allergy had higher scores (mean 1.15 vs. 0.99) p = 0.013 z = -2.486.

"The Relationship Between Creativity and Intrusive Rumination Among Chinese Teenagers During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Emotional Resilience as a Moderator","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has not only resulted in immeasurable life and property losses worldwide but has also impacted individuals' development, especially teenagers. After the COVID-19 pandemic, individual rumination as an important cognitive process should be given more attention because of its close associations with physical and mental health. Previous studies have shown that creativity as an antecedent variable can predict people's mental health or adaptation. However, few studies have focused on the relationship between creativity and individual cognitive rumination after traumatic events, and the mechanism underlying this relationship remains unclear. By using the Runco Ideational Behavior Scale (RIBS), the Event Related Rumination Inventory, and the Questionnaire of Adolescent Emotional Resilience, the current study explored the relationship between creativity and intrusive rumination among 1488 Chinese teenagers during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyzed the moderating effect of emotional resilience on the relationship. The results showed that creativity, as assessed by the RIBS, was positively related to teenagers' intrusive rumination, which implied that a higher level of creative performance could predict more intrusive rumination. Moreover, emotional resilience acted as a moderator in the relationship between creativity and intrusive rumination; the correlation was stronger when emotional resilience was low. These findings provide more evidence of the relationship between creativity and mental health and show the effect of this traumatic event on teenagers.","Wang, Zhao, Yuan, Shi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.601104","20210201","COVID-19; creativity; emotional resilience; intrusive rumination; teenagers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10158,""
"Patients Living With Breast Cancer During the Coronavirus Pandemic: The Role of Family Resilience, Coping Flexibility, and Locus of Control on Affective Responses","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has strongly affected oncology patients. Many screening and treatment programs have been postponed or canceled, and such patients also experience fear of increased risk of exposure to the virus. In many cases, locus of control, coping flexibility, and perception of a supportive environment, specifically family resilience, can allow for positive emotional outcomes for individuals managing complex health conditions like cancer. This study aims to determine if family resilience, coping flexibility, and locus of control can mitigate the negative affect caused by the pandemic and enhance positive affect in breast cancer patients. One hundred and fifty-four female patients with breast cancer completed the Walsh's Family Resilience Questionnaire, the Perceived Ability to Cope With Trauma Scale, the Positive-Negative Affect Schedule, and the Mini Locus of Control Scale. Family resilience and internality of locus of control contribute significantly to positive affective responses. Family resilience is responsible for mitigating the negative affect perceived during the pandemic and is enhanced by external locus of control. Evidence suggests that clinical psychologists should develop and propose programs to support oncology patients' family resilience, coping flexibility, and internal locus of control, allowing for decreased stress and improved adaptability for effectively managing cancer treatment during the pandemic.","Brivio, Guiddi, Scotto, Giudice, Pettini, Busacchio, Didier, Mazzocco, Pravettoni","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.567230","20210201","COVID-19; breast cancer; breast cancer patients; coping flexibility; coronavirus; family resilience; locus of control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10159,""
"Mental Health Outcomes Amongst Health Care Workers During COVID 19 Pandemic in Saudi Arabia","<b>Objectives:</b> The study aimed to assess the mental health outcomes and associated factors among health care workers during COVID 19 in Saudi Arabia. <b>Design, Setting, and Participants:</b> We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care workers from tertiary care and ministry of health Centers across the Central, Eastern, and Western regions of Saudi Arabia. There were 1,130 participants in the survey, and we collected demographic and mental health measurements from the participants. <b>Primary Outcomes and Measures:</b> The magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was measured using the original version of 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), and 7-item insomnia severity index (ISI). We use the multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the associated risk factors of individual outcomes. <b>Results:</b> The scores on the PHQ-9 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (76.93%) experienced only normal to mild depression (50.83 and 26.1%, respectively). The scores on the GAD-7 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (78.88%) experienced minimal to mild anxiety (50.41 and 28.47%, respectively). The scores on the ISI showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (85.83%) experienced absence to subthreshold insomnia (57.08 and 28.75%, respectively). The risk factors for depression in health care workers were Saudi, living with family, working from an isolated room at home and frontline worker. For anxiety, being female was risk factor and for insomnia, being frontline worker was risk factor. <b>Conclusion:</b> It was observed that the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were reported in a lower proportion of health care workers in our study. The participants who were female, frontline workers, Saudi, living with family, and working from home in isolated rooms were predisposed to developing psychological disorders.","Al Ammari, Sultana, Thomas, Al Swaidan, Al Harthi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.619540","20210201","COVID-19; Saudi Arabia (KSA); health care workers; mental health; outcomesÃ¢â‚¬â€health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10160,""
"Global Imperative of Suicidal Ideation in 10 Countries Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has had a detrimental impact on individuals' psychological well-being; however, a multi-country comparison on the prevalence of suicidal ideation due to the virus is still lacking. <b>Objectives:</b> To examine the prevalence and correlates of suicidal ideation among the general population across 10 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Materials and methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional study which used convenience sampling and collected data by conducting an online survey. Participants were sourced from 10 Eastern and Western countries. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to measure the outcome variable of suicidal ideation. Ordinal regression analysis was used to identify significant predictors associated with suicidal ideation. <b>Results:</b> A total of 25,053 participants (22.7% male) were recruited. Results from the analysis showed that the UK and Brazil had the lowest odds of suicidal ideation compared to Macau (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, younger age, male, married, and differences in health beliefs were significantly associated with suicidal ideation (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> The findings highlight the need for joint international collaboration to formulate effective suicide prevention strategies in a timely manner and the need to implement online mental health promotion platforms. In doing so, the potential global rising death rates by suicide during the pandemic can be reduced.","Cheung, Lam, Lee, Xiang, Yip","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.588781","20210201","COVID-19; PHQ-9 = Patient Health Questionnaire; mental health promotion; multi-country; suicidal ideation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10161,""
"Efforts and Challenges to Ensure Continuity of Mental Healthcare Service Delivery in a Low Resource Settings During COVID-19 Pandemic-A Case of a Kenyan Referral Hospital","The rising number of patients with Covid-19 as well as the infection control measures have affected healthcare service delivery, including mental healthcare. Mental healthcare delivery in low and middle income countries where resources were already limited are likely to be affected more during this pandemic. This paper describes the efforts of ensuring mental healthcare delivery is continued in a referral hospital in Kenya, Moi Teaching and Referral hospital, as well as the challenges faced. These efforts are guided by the interim guidelines developed by the Kenyan ministry of health. Some of the adjustments described includes reducing number of patients admitted, shortening the stay in the inpatient setting, using outdoors for therapy to promote physical distancing, utilization of electronic platforms for family therapy sessions, strengthening outpatient services, and supporting primary care workers to deliver mental health care services. Some of the challenges include limited ability to move about, declining ability for patients to pay out of pocket due to the economic challenges brought about by measures to control Covid-19, limited drug supplies in primary care facilities, inability to fully implement telehealth due to connectivity issues and stigma for mental health which results in poor social support for the mentally ill patients. It is clear that current pandemic has jeopardized the continuity of usual mental healthcare in many settings. This has brought to sharp focus the need to decentralize mental health care and promote community based services. Meanwhile, there is need to explore feasible alternatives to ensure continuity of care.","Kwobah, Jaguga, Robert, Ndolo, Kariuki","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.588216","20210201","Kenya; Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital; continuity of care; low resource setting; mental health care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10162,""
"Polish Experiences of Safety Measures Involving Forensic Psychiatric Inpatients Implemented During the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has made it necessary for us to adapt our healthcare systems to a very different sort of reality. This clearly also applies to psychiatric services. The restrictions and safeguards associated with the pandemic particularly concern adherence to social distancing and medical treatment safety procedures. The implementation of these procedures is generally complicated by conditions of forensic psychiatry where, in line with demands made by courts, the treatment and isolation of mentally unwell offenders must be carefully managed. In most countries, forensic psychiatric treatment is an inpatient service where patients are kept in restricted and cramped spaces, making social distancing difficult to implement as patients participate in compulsory group therapeutic activities. As a result, it is necessary to introduce unique recommendations relating to patient safety and treatment adapted to the realities of forensic psychiatry. All this requires the implementation of additional restrictions, over and above those arising from the essential aspects of forensic psychiatry. In this paper, we present and discuss the Polish guidelines for forensic psychiatric care during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, developed as a result of discussions on essential measures introduced to reduce the spread of the virus and the unique needs of the forensic patient population.","Heitzman, Gosek","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.576703","20210201","COVID-19; forensic psychiatry; mental health care; pandemic; safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10163,""
"Meaning Making Helps Cope with COVID-19: A Longitudinal Study","Meaning making is a useful coping strategy in negative situations. We investigated whether making meaning in negative experiences (MINE) would help people cope with COVID-19. We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study (<i>N</i> = 2364) three months before, during, and after the COVID-19 outbreak in China. Results showed that participants reported increased tendency of MINE during the COVID-19 outbreak than three months before the outbreak. Moreover, both initial MINE and the increased MINE predict less psychological distress including depression, anxiety, and stress, during and three months after the outbreak. Perceived benefits and costs of the COVID-19 mediated the long-term effect. These findings not only provide novel evidence for the meaning making model but also shed light on the underlying mechanism, suggesting an effective strategy to cope with stressful events such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Yang, Ji, Yang, Wang, Zhu, Cai","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2021.110670","20210201","COVID-19; coping; longitudinal; meaning in negative experiences (MINE); psychological adjustment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10164,""
"Inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by Catechins from Green Tea","Green tea extracts effectively inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Serially 10-fold diluted solutions of catechin mixture reagent from green tea were mixed with the viral culture fluid at a volume ratio of nine to one, respectively, and kept at room temperature for 5 min. The solution of 10 mg/mL catechin reagent reduced the viral titer by 4.2 log and 1.0 mg/mL solution reduced only by one log. Pre-infection treatment of the cells with the reagent alone did not affect the viral growth. In addition, cells treated with only the reagent was assayed for host-cell viability using the WST-8 system and almost no host-cell damage by the treatment was observed. These findings suggested that the direct treatment of virus with the reagent before inoculation decreased the viral activity and that catechins might have a potential to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nishimura, Okamoto, Dapat, Katumi, Oshitani","https://doi.org/10.7883/yoken.JJID.2020.902","20210201","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; catechin mixture from green tea; inactivation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10165,""
"Psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic within institutional quarantine and isolation centres and its sociodemographic correlates in Qatar: a cross-sectional study","The State of Qatar has had one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates globally and has used state-managed quarantine and isolation centres to limit the spread of infection. Quarantine and isolation have been shown to negatively affect the mental health of individuals. Qatar has a unique population, with around 90% of the population being economic migrants and a majority being blue-collar workers and labourers. This study was carried out to evaluate the psychological impact of institutional isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Qatar. The study also explored the sociodemographic correlates of this psychological impact. A cross-sectional study involving 748 consenting individuals in institutional quarantine and isolation in Qatar during the months of June and July 2020 was carried out. Relevant sociodemographic data along with depressive and anxiety symptomatology scores were collected from consenting adults at these facilities. 37.4% (n=270) of respondents reported depressive symptoms and 25.9% (n=189) reported anxiety symptoms. The scores were higher for individuals in isolation facilities and higher for migrants from poor socioeconomic group (p&lt;0.001 for both). Within this group, although worries about infection were widely reported, lack of contact with the family was cited as one of the most important sources of distress. Respondents reported that contact with the family and reliable information were important factors that helped during the duration of isolation and quarantine. Our study reported significantly elevated scores for depression and anxiety during institutional quarantine, which is in keeping with emerging evidence. However, in contrast to other studies reporting mostly from native populations, this study of a population with an overwhelming majority of immigrants highlights the special mental health needs of this specific group and can inform future healthcare policies.","Reagu, Wadoo, Latoo, Nelson, Ouanes, Masoodi, Karim, Iqbal, Al Abdulla, Al Nuaimi, Abdelmajid, Al Samawi, Khoodoruth, Khoodoruth, Al-Maslamani, Alabdulla","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-045794","20210201","adult psychiatry; anxiety disorders; depression &amp; mood disorders; mental health; public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10166,""
"The Future of Telehealth in School-Based Health Centers: Lessons from COVID-19","In response to COVID-19, schools rapidly transitioned to virtual learning. School-based health centers (SBHCs) required immediate shifts from in-person to telehealth services to continue supporting students. A qualitative analysis of nationally-led &quot;Listening and Learning&quot; sessions by the School-Based Health Alliance revealed substantial innovation and expansion of telehealth services. Providers and sponsoring organizations shared challenges and mechanisms for troubleshooting barriers during online webinars to provide support, education, and resources to SBHCs. Lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate the value of SBHCs, which continue to target barriers to health care access, protect the most vulnerable, and decrease the spread of disease. Telehealth implementation by SBHCs can support schools and communities, mitigate future strain on the health care system by continuing to keep youth from over-burdened emergency departments and provide needed mental health care. State and federal policy changes can ensure the continued provision of telehealth by SBHCs for disadvantaged youth.","Goddard, Sullivan, Fields, Mackey","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedhc.2020.11.008","20210201","COVID-19; School-based health centers; school health; telehealth; telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10167,""

Qualitative exploratory study through the analysis of illustrations carried out by schoolchildren aged 7 to 8. The analysis was carried out according to Rose's theoretical framework. Descriptive analysis of socio-demographic data was performed. Five categories emerged from the analysis of the content: 1) feelings of sadness and fear; 2) importance of the family nucleus, safety and protection; 3) sedentary living habits during confinement; 4) housing infrastructure and social inequalities (life through a window); and 5) social response, collective struggle and through health professionals. The COVID-19 pandemic situation and the strict confinement measures have had a significant impact on the school population, who had experienced the greatest restrictions. Household infrastructure has been shown to be a clear differentiator that deepens social inequalities and the impact that the situation has on school children.

"Mental health impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on parents in high-risk, low income communities","COVID-19 has spread across the globe, resulting in significant changes in virtually every aspect of life. Mitigation efforts, like shelter-in-place orders, have taken a particular toll on parents who have had to navigate disruptions in work and/or school schedules. Research from high-income countries demonstrates increased parental anxiety, stress, depression, and burnout resulting from the pandemic. It is unclear if these outcomes are the same for parents in high-risk communities in low-income countries where pre-pandemic conditions were deleterious. This study addresses this gap and examines the mental health impact of the pandemic on parents in high-risk communities in Guatemala. A total of 330 individuals from 11 districts in Guatemala participated in the study and were assessed for sociodemographic characteristics and mental health impairment. Chi-squares were conducted for bivariate analysis. Multivariate analysis was conducted using binary logistic regression. Bivariate analysis revealed differences between groups on burnout, with parents more often reporting feelings of burnout than nonparents (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). Binary regression demonstrated that non-parents were 70% less likely to endorse feelings of stress as compared to parents (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.285; <i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.014). Our findings underscore the importance of identifying the unique mental health impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on parents in high-risk communities. In high-risk communities, parental stress is a pressing problem that, if unaddressed, has the potential to result in even greater psychological distress and child maltreatment. Training community healthcare providers to assess and address parental stress can lead to increased community capacity and the development of a community-based network to serve as a first line of support for parents and their children.","Alonzo, Popescu, Zubaroglu Ioannides","https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764021991896","20210201","Parental mental health; low-income; marginalized communities; pandemic; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10169,""

"Sleep and Psychological Difficulties in Italian School-Age Children During COVID-19 Lockdown","On March 10, 2020, the Italian Government ordered a national lockdown to limit the viral transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 infections. This study investigated how these restrictive measures have impacted sleep quality, timing, and psychological difficulties in school-age children and their mothers during the lockdown. In an online survey, 299 mothers reported their sleep habits, experience of time, and psychological difficulties as well as those of their children (6-10Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old) during and, retrospectively, before the lockdown. During the lockdown, children showed a marked delay in sleep timing-that is, later bedtime and rise time-and a mild worsening in sleep quality. They were less prone to respect daily routines or to keep track of the passage of time. They showed increased emotional, conduct, and hyperactive symptoms, and the increase in these psychological difficulties was predicted by the change in sleep quality, boredom, and mothers' psychological difficulties. In addition, mothers showed a delayed sleep timing and worsening of sleep quality during the lockdown, in varying degrees depending on their working conditions. Mothers who kept working regularly outside their homes during lockdown reported more regular sleep patterns, whereas mothers who stopped working showed more emotional symptoms and relevant changes in their perception of time. Overall, given the evidence of the adverse behavioral and psychological impact of home confinement and social restrictions, effective measures needed to be in place to mitigate long-term effects on children and their mothers, especially those who have had to stop working during lockdown.","Cellini, Di Giorgio, Mioni, Di Riso","https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab003","20210131","behavior problems; health behavior; mental health; parent psychological functioning; public health; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","2021-02-02","",10171,""
"Pregnancy and COVID-19: pharmacologic considerations","In this review, we summarize evidence regarding the use of routine and investigational pharmacologic interventions for pregnant and lactating patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Antenatal corticosteroids may be used routinely for fetal lung maturation between 24 and 34Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks' gestation, but decisions in those with critical illness and those &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°24 or &gt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°34Ã¢â‚¬â€°weeks' gestation should be made on a case-by-case basis. Magnesium sulfate may be used for seizure prophylaxis and fetal neuroprotection, albeit cautiously in those with hypoxia and renal compromise. There are no contraindications to using low-dose aspirin to prevent placenta-mediated pregnancy complications when indicated. An algorithm for thromboprophylaxis in pregnant patients with COVID-19 is presented, which considers disease severity, timing of delivery in relation to disease onset, inpatient vs outpatient status, underlying comorbidities and contraindications to the use of anticoagulation. Nitrous oxide may be administered for labor analgesia while using appropriate personal protective equipment. Intravenous remifentanil patient-controlled analgesia should be used with caution in patients with respiratory depression. Liberal use of neuraxial labor analgesia may reduce the need for emergency general anesthesia which results in aerosolization. Short courses of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can be administered for postpartum analgesia, but opioids should be used with caution due to the risk of respiratory depression. For mechanically ventilated pregnant patients, neuromuscular blockade should be used for the shortest duration possible and reversal agents should be available on hand if delivery is imminent. To date, dexamethasone is the only proven and recommended experimental treatment for pregnant patients with COVID-19 who are mechanically ventilated or who require supplemental oxygen. Although hydroxycholoroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir may be used during pregnancy and lactation within the context of clinical trials, data from non-pregnant populations have not shown benefit. The role of monoclonal antibodies (tocilizumab), immunomodulators (tacrolimus), interferon, inhaled nitric oxide and convalescent plasma in pregnancy and lactation needs further evaluation.
