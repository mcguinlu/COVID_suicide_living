"The effect of ego-resiliency and COVID-19-related stress on mental health among the Japanese population","Due to the negative psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide, it is necessary to study the factors that improve mental health. In this study, we evaluated changing income, frequency of going out, fear of COVID-19, depression, anxiety, stress, and ego-resiliency to investigate the main and moderating effects of ego-resiliency on psychological distress. We analyzed 222 Japanese samples from the dataset of Primary Survey in Japan (PSJ) in the Resilience to COVid-19 in Each Region (RE-COVER) project. The results showed significant main effects of ego-resiliency on depression (<U+0394>R2 = .07, p < .01) and stress (<U+0394>R2 = .02, p < .05), and interaction effect of going out and ego-resiliency on depression (ÃŸ = .19, p < .01; <U+0394>R2 = .05, p < .01). We also tested the significance of the moderating effect of ego-resiliency on the relationship between going out and depression. The simple slope of ego-resiliency was only significant for individuals with a low frequency of going out (ÃŸ = -0.278, t (218) = -4.522, p < .001). Our findings provide empirical evidence on mental health associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among the Japanese population, proving that ego-resiliency functioned to cope with the specific stress associated with COVID-19 and promote adaptation.","Takahiro Kubo et al.","https://share.osf.io/preprint/46117-CB2-5E4","20200913","PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Clinical Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Mental Health; PsyArXiv|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Health Psychology|Stress; stress; covid-19; covid-19 related stress; ego-resiliency","PsyArXiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-09-13","",4721,""
