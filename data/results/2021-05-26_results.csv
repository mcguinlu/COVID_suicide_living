"How COVID-19 challenged care for women and their newborns: a qualitative case study of the experience of Belgian midwives during the first wave of the pandemic","In this article, we describe the results of a rapid qualitative study conducted between May 19 and June 25, 2020 on the work experience of midwives during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brussels and Wallonia (Belgium). Using semi-structured interviews conducted with fifteen midwives working in hospitals or practicing privately, we investigated the impact of the first COVID-19 wave on their work experience, the woman-midwife relationship, and midwife-perceived changes in quality of care. Findings include high levels of stress and insecurity related to the lack of resources and personal protective equipment, feelings of distrust from midwives towards the Belgian State and public health authorities, as well as structural and organizational challenges within maternity wards which negatively affected quality of care. Moreover, based on the midwives' experiences, we demonstrate the need to recognise the views of all stakeholders involved in maternal and newborn care provision, and share five essential lessons learned from this study: 1) it is crucial to acknowledge the central role of midwives for maintaining maternal and newborn care amidst the pandemic and beyond; 2) creating unified national guidelines could support ensuring best practice; 3) efforts must be put in place to diminish the climate of mistrust towards health authorities and to repair the relationship between midwives and decision-makers which was damaged during the pandemic; 4) caring for front-line healthcare workers' mental health is critical, and 5) quality of maternal care can be improved, even in the midst of a pandemic, through team effort and creative solutions tailored to the needs and demands of each setting.","Elise Huysmans; Constance Audet; Therese Delvaux; Anna Galle; Aline Semaan; Anteneh Asefa; Lenka Benova","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.21.21257440","20210525","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14035,""
"Business as Un-usual: Access to mental health and primary care services for people with severe mental illness during the COVID-19 restrictions","Aims: To explore: how satisfied people with severe mental illness (SMI) are with the support received during the pandemic; understand any difficulties encountered when accessing both mental health and primary care services; consider ways to mitigate these difficulties; and assess the perceived need for future support from mental health services. Materials and Methods: A representative sample was drawn from a large transdiagnostic clinical cohort of people with SMI, which was recruited between April 2016 and March 2020. The sample was re-surveyed a few months after the beginning of the restrictions. Descriptive frequency statistics were used to analyse the quantitative data. The free text responses were analysed thematically. Results: 367 participants responded to the survey. Two thirds were receiving support from mental health services with the rest supported in primary care or self-managing. A quarter thought they would need more mental health support in the coming year. Half had needed to used community mental health services during the pandemic and the majority had been able to get support. A minority reported that their mental health had deteriorated but they had either not got the supported they wanted or had not sought help. The biggest service change was the reduction in face-to-face appointments and increasing use of phone and video call support. Nearly half of those using mental health services found this change acceptable or even preferred it; acceptability was influenced by several factors. Participants were more likely to be satisfied with support received when seen in person. Discussion: Although most participants were satisfied with the mental health support they had received, a minority were not. This, couple with findings on future need for mental health support has implications for post pandemic demand on services. Remote care has brought benefits but also risks that it could increase inequalities in access to services.","Elizabeth Newbronner; Panagiotis Spanakis; Ruth Wadman; Suzanne Crosland; Paul Heron; Gordon Johnston; Lauren Walker; Simon Gilbody; Emily Peckham","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.05.24.21257694","20210525","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14036,""
"Proof-of-concept support for the development and implementation of a digital assessment for perinatal mental health: a mixed methods study","Perinatal mental health symptoms commonly remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in maternity care settings in the UK, with outbreaks of disease, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, further disrupting access to adequate mental health support. Digital technologies may offer an innovative way to support the mental health needs of women and their families throughout the perinatal period, as well as assist midwives in the recognition of perinatal mental health concerns. However, little is known about the acceptability and perceived benefits and barriers to using such technologies. To conduct a mixed methods evaluation of the current state of perinatal mental healthcare provision in the UK, as well as users' (women and partners) and midwives' interest in using a digital mental health assessment throughout the perinatal period. Eight hundred and twenty-nine women, 103 partners, and 90 midwives participated in the study, which entailed completing an online survey. Quantitative data were explored using descriptive statistics. Open-ended response data were first investigated using thematic analysis. Resultant themes were then mapped onto the components of the Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Model of Behavior (COM-B model) and summarized using descriptive statistics. The provision of adequate perinatal mental healthcare support was limited, with experiences varying significantly across respondents. There was a strong interest in using a digital mental health assessment to screen, diagnose, and triage perinatal mental health concerns, particularly among women and midwives. The digital assessment was seen to be well placed within maternity healthcare settings, with in-person only and blended care (i.e., in-person and remote support) approaches being preferred by women and partners in the event of further care being advised. Identified benefits and barriers mainly related to physical opportunity (e.g., accessibility), psychological capability (e.g., cognitive skills) and automatic motivation (e.g., emotions). This study provides proof-of-concept support for the development and implementation of a digital mental health assessment to inform clinical decision-making in the assessment of perinatal mental health concerns in the UK.","Martin-Key, Spadaro, Schei, Bahn","https://doi.org/10.2196/27132","20210525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14037,""
"Coping Styles Mediates the Effect of Resilience on Medical Students' Depression in the Context of Online Classes during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Due to the strict nationwide COVID-19 comprehensive protective measures, which included home quarantine, all Chinese medical students began taking online classes beginning in the spring semester of 2020. Home quarantine, online classes, and the stress surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic may have triggered increased mental health problems of medical students. Although there has been an increasing literature on depression among medical students, studies focusing on positive psychological resources such as resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic still need to be expanded. The present study aims at assessing depression of medical students taking online classes during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigating the role of coping styles as a mediator between resilience and depression. A cross-sectional study of 666 medical students with stratified sampling in Shenyang, Liaoning Province in China was completed between March 20th, 2020 and April 10th, 2020. The participants responded to a self-administered smartphone-based questionnaire which included Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), and Ego-Resilience scale (ER-89). Hierarchical linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used in this study. The prevalence of depression in the participants was 9.6% (64/666) in this study. Regression analysis revealed that grade (the year in which the medical student was in their training), how well they adapted to online classes, their levels of resilience, and their coping styles were independent predictors for depression (P&lt;.05). Resilience and positive coping style were negatively related to depression and negative coping style was positively related to depression (P&lt;.01). SEM showed that the effect of resilience on depression was partially mediated by coping styles(P&lt;.01). It was found in the present study the prevalence of depression was slightly low and coping styles mediated the association between resilience and depression among medical students during COVID-19, which was of significant implications for further study. Future studies and interventions are supposed to be aimed at improving resilience and promoting positive coping style.","Zhao, Sznajder, Cheng, Wang, Cui, Yang","https://doi.org/10.2196/25259","20210525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14038,""
"Digital solutions to alleviate the burden on health systems during a public healthcare crisis: COVID-19 as an opportunity","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has generated unprecedented and sustained health management challenges worldwide. Healthcare systems continue to struggle to support the needs of the majority of infected individuals that are either asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. In addition, long term effects in the form of long Covid symptoms or widespread mental health issues aggravated by the pandemic pose a burden on healthcare systems world- wide. This viewpoint article considers aspects of digital healthcare solutions and how they can play an ongoing role in safely addressing gaps in the healthcare support available from initially, and repeatedly, overwhelmed providers and systems. Digital solutions can be readily designed to address this need and can be flexible enough to adapt to the evolving management requirements of various stakeholders to reduce COVID-19 infection rates, acute hospitalizations, and mortality. Multiplatform solutions provide a hybrid model of care which can include mobile and online platforms accompanied by direct clinician input and feedback. Desirable components to be included are discussed, including symptom tracking, patient education, wellbeing support, and bi-directional communication between patients and clinicians. Customizable, scalable, digital health platforms not only can be readily adapted to further meet the needs of employers and public health stakeholders during the ongoing pandemic, but also hold relevance for flexibly meeting broader care management needs into the future.","Willems, Rao, Bhambere, Patel, Biggins, Guite","https://doi.org/10.2196/25021","20210525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14039,""

"Neuroprotective role of camphor against ciprofloxacin induced depression in rats: modulation of Nrf-2 and TLR4","Depression affects people feeling to be anxious, worried, and restless. They also lose interest in activities, concentrating and appetite, they finally may attempt suicide. Depression is the second chronic disease, as a source of the global burden of disease, after heart disease. Its prevalence elevated seven times during the COVID-19. The current study was designed to evaluate camphor neuroprotective role against rats' ciprofloxacin-induced depression. Depression was induced by administration of ciprofloxacin (50Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/kg; orally) for 21 days. Wister albino male rats were divided into five groups. Group I (normal control): rats were given normal saline. Group II: rats received camphor (10Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days. Group III (depression control): rats received ciprofloxacin only. Groups IV and V: rats received camphor (5 and 10Ã¢â‚¬â€°mg/kg; i.p.) for 21 days concurrent with ciprofloxacin. Behavior tests as forced swimming test, activity cage, and rotarod were estimated. Oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarkers as malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), catalase, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) besides inflammatory biomarkers as Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-ÃŽÂ±) as well as neurotransmitters were determined. Finally, histopathological examination was done. Camphor increased catalase and Nrf-2 activities, decreased NO, MDA, TNF-ÃŽÂ±, TLR4 serum levels, and elevating brain contents of serotonin, dopamine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and P190-RHO GTP protein with normal neuronal cells of the frontal cortex.

"Disentangling the Relationship between Food Insecurity and Poor Sleep Health","The COVID-19 pandemic has created disruptions in global and national food supply chains. Along with an increase in the unemployment rate, this resulted in a rise in food insecurity at the community-level, threatening individual and family well-being. Food insecurity is associated with inadequate nutrient intakes, weight gain, and psychological distress, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, all of which are known to affect sleep. Yet, little is known about whether and how food insecurity is associated with sleep health, a critical but underrecognized health outcome.

"Virtual screening of quinoline derived library for SARS-COV-2 targeting viral entry and replication","The COVID-19 pandemic infection has claimed many lives and added to the social, economic, and psychological distress. The contagious disease has quickly spread to almost 218 countries and territories following the regional outbreak in China. As the number of infected populations increases exponentially, there is a pressing demand for anti-COVID drugs and vaccines. Virtual screening provides possible leads while extensively cutting down the time and resources required for ab-initio drug design. We report structure-based virtual screening of a hundred plus library of quinoline drugs with established antiviral, antimalarial, antibiotic or kinase inhibitor activity. In this study, targets having a role in viral entry, viral assembly, and viral replication have been selected. The targets include: 1) RBD of receptor-binding domain spike protein S 2) M<sup>pro</sup> Chymotrypsin main protease 3) P<sup>pro</sup> Papain protease 4) RNA binding domain of Nucleocapsid Protein, and 5) RNA Dependent RNA polymerase from SARS-COV-2. An in-depth analysis of the interactions and G-score compared to the controls like hydroxyquinoline and remdesivir has been presented. The salient results are (1) higher scoring of antivirals as potential drugs (2) potential of afatinib by scoring as better inhibitor, and (3) biological explanation of the potency of afatinib. Further MD simulations and MM-PBSA calculations showed that afatinib works best to interfere with the the activity of RNA dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-COV-2, thereby inhibiting replication process of single stranded RNA virus.

"Time for Inclusion of Racial and Gender Discrimination in Routine Clinical Assessment","Recently, there has been an increasing amount of scientific interest towards the broad theme of racial inequalities and their impact on human health, specifically exploring how ethnic discrimination affects the wellness of black people and the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of these conditions of inequity also affect black children. Discrimination and racism should be routinely considered as causative agents or triggers of disease and routinely included in clinical examination, during history collection and evaluation of vital signs. This will benefit child and family health, worldwide. We shared our recent experience by reporting a case of a 13-year-old black girl who came to Italy from Niger about 3 years earlier through the traumatizing migratory journey. She was evaluated in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) for sleepiness that had progressively worsened during the last days. We describe the case and how it was handled differently by pediatricians and pediatric trainees with equally different personal and professional backgrounds.We also report the preliminary results of a national survey aimed to assess discrimination and inequalities in Italian Paediatric Residency Schools. Medical ability has been allowing us to respond rapidly to a novel virus in order to save lives.

"Electroencephalography-detected neurophysiology of internet addiction disorder and internet gaming disorder in adolescents - A review","Internet Addiction Disorder (IAD) is an umbrella term for various types of Internet-based behavioural addiction, whereas Internet Gaming Disorder (IGD) addresses a specific type of IAD that is postulated to be due to a lack of control in impulse inhibition. IGD is an area of concern in the Diagnostic and Statistics Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), which can be objectively assessed by dysfunctional behaviour and the increasing time of being online, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electroencephalography (EEG) identifies amplitude changes in the evoked response potential (ERP) among IGDs, correlated with underlying comorbidities. A scoping review was performed to elaborate on the research regarding resting-state EEG and task-based EEG, particularly for Go/No-go paradigms pertaining to subjects with IAD or specifically IGD. The role of EEG was identified in its diagnostic capability to identify the salient changes that occurred in the response to reward network and the executive control network, using restingstate and task-based EEG. The implication of using EEG in monitoring the therapy for IAD and IGD was also reviewed. EEG generally revealed reduced beta waves and increased theta waves in addicts. IGD with depression demonstrated increased theta and decreased alpha waves. Whereas increased P300, a late cognitive ERP component, was frequently associated with impaired excessive allocation of attentional resources of the IAD towards addiction-specific cues. IGD had increased whole brain delta waves at baseline, which showed significant reduction post therapy. EEG can identify distinct neurophysiological changes among Internet Addiction Disorder and Internet Gaming Disorder that are akin to substance abuse disorders.","Sharifat, Suppiah","https://www.google.com/search?q=Electroencephalography-detected+neurophysiology+of+internet+addiction+disorder+and+internet+gaming+disorder+in+adolescents+-+A+review.","20210525","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14046,""

We aimed to determine the response of our paediatric surgical fraternity to a disease that overwhelmingly affects adults. We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study over 6 weeks during a federally mandated lockdown. Using snowball sampling, we recruited paediatric surgeons, trainees and medical officers from paediatric surgical units in Malaysia. The anonymous online questionnaire covered sociodemographic information, changes in patient care, redeployment, concerns regarding family members, and impact on training. Mental well-being was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA and multiple regression analysis was used, with significance level 0.05. Of the 129 eligible participants, 100(77%) responded. Junior doctors had clinically higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress. Age &lt;30 years was significantly associated with anxiety. Junior doctors believed that redeployment led to loss of surgical skills (p&lt;0.001) and trainees felt that clinical application of knowledge had reduced (p&lt;0.020).

"<b>Cysteine modification by ebselen reduces the stability and cellular levels of 14-3-3 proteins</b>","The 14-3-3 proteins constitute a family of regulatory adapter proteins with many binding partnersand biological functions, and are considered promising drug targets in cancer and neuropsychiatry.By screening 1280 small-molecule drugs using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), we found 15 compounds that decreased the thermal stability of 14-3-3ÃŽÂ¶. Among these compounds, ebselen was identified as a covalent, destabilizing ligand of 14-3-3 isoforms ÃŽÂ¶, ÃŽÂµ, ÃŽÂ³ and ÃŽÂ·. Ebselen bonding decreased 14-3-3ÃŽÂ¶ binding to its partner Ser19-phosphorylated tyrosine hydroxylase. Characterization of site-directed mutants at cysteine residues in 14-3-3ÃŽÂ¶ (C25, C94, and C189) by DSF and mass spectroscopy revealed covalent modification by ebselen of all cysteines. C25 was identified as the preferential site of ebselen interaction in vitro, whereas modification of C94 was mainly responsible for the protein destabilization. At therapeutic relevant concentrations ebselen caused a decrease of 14-3-3 levels in both SHSY5Y cells and zebrafish brain, accompanied with an increased degradation by the ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathway. Moreover, ebselen-treated zebrafish displayed a freezing phenotype and reduced mobility, resembling the effects of lithium, in line with the proposed action of ebselen as a potentially safer lithium-mimetic drug. Ebselen has recently emerged as a promising drug candidate in several medical areas, including cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious diseases, including Covid-19. Its pleiotropic actions are attributed to antioxidant effects, and the formation of selenosulfides with critical cysteine residues in proteins. Our work indicates that a destabilization of 14-3-3 may affect the protein interaction networks of this protein family, contributing to the therapeutic potential of ebselen. <b>Significance Statement</b> There is currently great interest in the repurposing of established drugs for new indications and therapeutic targets. This study shows that ebselen, which is a promising drug candidate against cancer, bipolar disorder and the virus infection Covid-19, covalently bonds to cysteine residues in 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, triggering 14-3-3 destabilization and degradation in cells and intact brain tissue when used in therapeutic concentrations, potentially explaining the behavioral and anti-neoplastic effects of this drug.","WalÃƒÂ¸en, Jung, Vecchia, Pandey, Gasparik, DÃƒÂ¸skeland, Patil, Kleppe, Hritz, Norton, Martinez, Haavik","https://doi.org/10.1124/molpharm.120.000184","20210525","Oxidative stress/antioxidants; Protein targets; brain/CNS; covalent drug binding; mood stabilizers; neuroblastoma; neurodegeneration; neurotransmitters","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14049,""
"Changes in presentations with features potentially indicating cancer in primary care during the COVID-19 pandemic: a retrospective cohort study","To investigate how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the number of people aged 50+ years presentingÃ¢â‚¬â€°to primary care with features that could potentially indicate cancer, and to explore how reporting differed by patient characteristics and in face-to-face vs remote consultations. A retrospective cohort study of general practitioner (GP), nurse and paramedic primary care consultations in 21 practices in South-West England covering 123Ã¢â‚¬â€°947 patients. The models compared potential cancer indicators reported in April-July 2019 with April-July 2020. Potential indicators of cancer were identified using code lists for symptoms, signs, test results and diagnoses listed in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence suspected cancer referral guidance (NG12). During April-July 2019, 17% of registered patients aged 50+ years reported a potential cancer indicator in a consultation with a GP or nurse. During April-July 2020, this reduced to 11% (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.64, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.62 to 0.67, p&lt;0.001). Reductions in potential cancer indicators were stable across age group, sex, ethnicity, index of multiple deprivation quintile and shielding status, but less marked in patients with mental health conditions than without (IRR 0.75, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.72 to 0.79, interaction p&lt;0.001). Proportions of GP consultations with potential indicators of cancer reduced between 2019 and 2020 for face-to-face consultations (IRR 0.84, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.76 to 0.92, p&lt;0.001) and increased for remote consultations (IRR 1.17, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.07 to 1.29, p=0.001), although it remained lower in remote consulting than face-to-face in April-July 2020. This difference was greater for nurse/paramedic consultations (face-to-face: IRR 0.61, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 0.44 to 0.83, p=0.002; remote: IRR 1.60, 95%Ã¢â‚¬â€°CI 1.10 to 2.333, p=0.014). The number of patients consulting with presentations that could potentially indicate cancer reduced during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients should be encouraged to continue contacting primary care for persistent signs and symptoms, and GPs and nurses should be encouraged to probe patients for further information during remote consulting, in the absence of non-verbal cues.","Scott, Murphy, Price, Lewis, Denholm, Horwood, Palmer, Salisbury","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050131","20210525","COVID-19; oncology; primary care","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14050,""
"Depression level and coping responses toward the movement control order and its impact on quality of life in the Malaysian community during the COVID-19 pandemic: a web-based cross-sectional study","Coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease prompting extreme containment measures, including lockdown, travel restrictions, social distancing, and stringent personal hygiene. This study investigates the depression level and coping responses toward the lockdown, referred as the movement control order (MCO) during COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia and its impact on quality of life. This cross-sectional study was conducted from April to May 2020. The outcomes were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory, and World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF Scale (WHOQOL-BREF) in both English and validated Malay versions. Mild-to-severe depression was found in 28.2% (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°149) of the 528 respondents. Respondents with mild-to-severe depression were significantly younger (33.09Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.08 versus 36.79Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°12.47Ã‚Â years), without partner (71.8% versus 45.6%), lived in the red zone (85.9% versus 71.0%), and had lower household income as defined in the category of B40 (51.7% versus 39.3%) compared to those without depression (all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01). The avoidant coping score was significantly higher (25.43Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.69 versus 20.78Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°5.65), while the religious coping score was significantly lower (5.10Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.07 versus 5.94Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.11) among those with mild-to-severe depression compared to those without depression (both pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001). Respondents with mild-to-severe depression also had significantly lower mean score in each domain of WHOQOL-BREF compare to those without depression [(physical health, 13.63Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.66 versus 16.20Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.11), (psychological, 12.5Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.79 versus 16.10Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.14), (social relationships, 12.17Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.49 versus 15.28Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.93), environment (14.50Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.39 versus 16.21Ã¢â‚¬â€°Ã‚Â±Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.14), all pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001] after controlling for age, marital status, zone, household income, and coping scores. COVID-19 lockdown had adverse mental health effects. Our study highlighted that approximately one in three individual experienced mild-to-severe depression during the nationwide MCO. The varied impact of the pandemic on mental health could be due to different population characteristics and coping strategies used. Identifying those at higher risk to develop depression during MCO for COVID-19 pandemic could help mental healthcare service providers to plan services for those susceptible, thereby mitigating the pandemic's effect on quality of life.","Yee, Hodori, Tung, Ooi, Latif, Isa, Ng, Chai, Tan","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12991-021-00352-4","20210525","COVID-19 pandemic; Coping; Coronavirus; Depression; Mental health; Quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14051,""
"COVID-19 and disconnected youth: Lessons and opportunities from OECD countries","This paper highlights how the novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has amplified economic instability and health risks for disconnected youth and young adults (YYA). We offer a brief review of governmental policy responses in four OECD countries and how they may impact the disconnect YYA within those countries. Literature was reviewed utilizing Cochrane Library, ERIC, PsychINFO, PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science to outline existing inequities among disconnected YYA and COVID-19 economic and health impacts. Government responses to COVID-19 from four OECD countries were reviewed. Using the social protection model, we highlighted significant policy changes and developments that influence the protection of vulnerable populations and evaluated the potential effect of long-term economic dislocations prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Disconnected YYA suffered significant financial and health burdens with no social protection floor in place. Lessons learned prior to and during the pandemic indicate that initiatives aimed at improving health and well-being among vulnerable YYA and their communities must be adequately funded, flexible, and comprehensive. Attempts to connect or reconnect YYA who were disconnected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic will require a re-envisioning of policy.  <b>Globally, governments must invest in social safety net programs that focus on supporting those most at-risk. A concentrated focus on job creation, education and training, and paid work experience, investments in early childhood care and education, housing, health and mental health care is necessary to not only offset the pandemic's effects but also support thriving in the future for YYA.</b> ","Palmer, Small","https://doi.org/10.1177/14034948211017017","20210525","COVID-19; Disconnected youth; NEET; and health inequities; child/adolescent/young adult health; economic; social","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-05-26","",14052,""
