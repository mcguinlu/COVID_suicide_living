"The SARS-CoV-2 and mental health: From biological mechanisms to social consequences","In December 2019, the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19) infection was reported  In only few weeks it has caused a global pandemic, with mortality reaching 3 4%, mostly due to a severe pneumonia  However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the central nervous system (CNS) and mental health outcomes remains unclear  Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of other types of coronaviruses in the brain, especially in the brainstem  There is evidence that the novel coronavirus can penetrate CNS through the olfactory or circulatory route as well as it can have an indirect impact on the brain by causing cytokine storm  There are also first reports of neurological signs in patients infected by the SARS-Cov-2  They show that COVID-19 patients have neurologic manifestations like acute cerebrovascular disease, conscious disturbance, taste and olfactory disturbances  In addition, there are studies showing that certain psychopathological symptoms might appear in infected patients, including those related to mood and psychotic disorders as well as post-traumatic stress disorder  Accumulating evidence also indicates that the pandemic might have a great impact on mental health from the global perspective, with medical workers being particularly vulnerable  In this article, we provide a review of studies investigating the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS and mental health outcomes  We describe neurobiology of the virus, highlighting the relevance to mental disorders  Furthermore, this article summarizes the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 from the public health perspective  Finally, we present a critical appraisal of evidence and indicate future directions for studies in this field","Szczesniak, Dorota; Gladka, Anna; Misiak, Blazej, Cyran; Agnieszka, Rymaszewska; Joanna","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.110046","","Database: COVIDWHO; Publication details: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry;2020.; Publication details: Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry;2020.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3496,""

"An Integrated Blueprint for Digital Mental Health Services Amidst COVID-19","In-person traditional approaches to mental health care services are facing difficulties amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis. The recent implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, Luke; De Leo, Diego","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/21718","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(7): e21718, 2020 Jul 22.; Publication details: JMIR Ment Health;7(7): e21718, 2020 Jul 22.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3499,""
"Belief in a COVID-19 Conspiracy Theory as a Predictor of Mental Health and Well-Being of Health Care Workers in Ecuador: Cross-Sectional Survey Study","BACKGROUND: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, social media platforms have become active sites for the dissemination of conspiracy theories that provide alternative explanations of the cause of the pandemic, such as secret plots by powerful and malicious groups. However, the association of individuals' beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction among health care workers. This finding will enable mental health services to better target and provide help to mentally vulnerable health care workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Xi; Zhang, Stephen X; Jahanshahi, Asghar Afshar; Alvarez-Risco, Aldo; Dai, Huiyang; Li, Jizhen; Ibarra, VerÃ³nica GarcÃ­a","https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/20737","","Country: CA; CANADÃ; CANADA; CANADA; Database: MEDLINE; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(3): e20737, 2020 Jul 21.; Publication details: JMIR Public Health Surveill;6(3): e20737, 2020 Jul 21.; Publication type: article","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3500,""

"Early impact of COVID-19 on individuals with self-reported eating disorders: A survey of ~1,000 individuals in the United States and the Netherlands","We evaluated the early impact of COVID-19 on people with self-reported eating disorders. Participants in the United States (US, N = 511) and the Netherlands (NL, N = 510), recruited through ongoing studies and social media, completed an online survey that included both quantitative measures and free-text responses assessing the impact of COVID-19 on situational circumstances, eating disorder symptoms, eating disorder treatment, and general well-being. Results revealed strong and wide-ranging effects on eating disorder concerns and illness behaviors that were consistent with eating disorder type. Participants with anorexia nervosa (US 62% of sample; NL 69%) reported increased restriction and fears about being able to find foods consistent with their meal plan. Individuals with bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder (US 30% of sample; NL 15%) reported increases in their binge-eating episodes and urges to binge. Respondents noted marked increases in anxiety since 2019 and reported greater concerns about the impact of COVID-19 on their mental health than physical health. Although many participants acknowledged and appreciated the transition to telehealth, limitations of this treatment modality for this population were raised. Individuals with past histories of eating disorders noted concerns about relapse related to COVID-19 circumstances. Encouragingly, respondents also noted positive effects including greater connection with family, more time for self-care, and motivation to recover. COVID-19 is associated with increased anxiety and poses specific disorder-related challenges for individuals with eating disorders that require attention by healthcare professionals and carers.","Termorshuizen, Watson, Thornton, Borg, Flatt, MacDermod, Harper, van Furth, Peat, Bulik","https://doi.org/10.1002/eat.23353","20200728","COVID-19; coronavirus; eating disorders; mental health; pandemic; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3504,""

"Prevention and Control of COVID-19 Infection in a Chinese Mental Health Center","Faced with the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a global public health threat, psychiatric hospitals are under huge pressure to prevent and control nosocomial infection. The current research analyzed the COVID-19 infection control practices in a regional mental health center in China and addressed how this type of medical institutions could enhance their ability to prevent and control hospital transmission of major respiratory diseases and general management of nosocomial infection risks. Firstly, hospital-related risks of COVID-19 were analyzed, and targeted prevention and control measures were then established. Pre- and post-intervention theoretical knowledge of nosocomial infection control, hand hygiene compliance and accuracy, use of personal protective equipment, and disinfection and sterilization effectiveness were evaluated and compared. All the indexes displayed significant improvements following the implementation of the prevention and control measures. Up to the submission of this paper, the mental health center had obtained no suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 infection due to hospital transmission. The findings provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the COVID-19 preventive strategies and have important implications for integrated and characterized infection control in mental health centers during a major epidemic. The establishment of the transitional isolation ward and air fumigation using traditional Chinese medicine for patients and staff are preventive measures worthy of further discussion and dissemination.","Yang, Wang, Li, Zhang, Liu, He, Gao","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2020.00356","20200728","mental health center; nosocomial infection; outbreak; prevention and control practice; the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3506,""
"Epilepsy Care in the Time of COVID-19 Pandemic in Italy: Risk Factors for Seizure Worsening","<b>Objective:</b> In early 2020, Italy struggled with an unprecedented health emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical care of chronic neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, is being sorely neglected. In this national survey, we aimed at understanding the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on the care of people with epilepsy (PwE) and identifying PwE risk factors for seizure worsening to direct telemedicine efforts. <b>Methods:</b> We administered a 48-items online survey (published on April 11, 2020) including socio-demographic, epilepsy-related, and psychometric variables (BDI-II for depression, GAD-7 for anxiety, and PSQI for sleep) to PwE and people without epilepsy (PwoE). Regression analysis identified predictors of seizure worsening. <b>Results:</b> We collected responses from 456 PwE (344 females) and 472 PwoE (347 females). Outpatient examinations of PwE were postponed in 95% of cases. One-third of PwE complained of issues with epilepsy management, but only 71% of them reached the treating physician and solved their problems. PwE had worse depressive and anxiety symptoms (higher BDI-II and GAD-7 scores; <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) than PwoE. Sleep quality was equally compromised in both groups (47 and 42%). Sixty-seven PwE (18%) reported seizure worsening, which was best explained by the number of anti-seizure medications (ASM) of chronic therapy and the severity of sleep disorder. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the current COVID-19 pandemic, a significant percentage of PwE experienced difficulties in follow-up and a seizure number increase, in particular those chronically taking more ASMs and with poor sleep quality. This dramatic experience outlines the urgent need for validation and implementation of telemedicine services for epileptic patients in order to provide regular follow-up.","Assenza, Lanzone, Brigo, Coppola, Di Gennaro, Di Lazzaro, Ricci, Romigi, Tombini, Mecarelli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.00737","20200728","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; epilepsy; sleep","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3507,""
"Parents' Stress and Children's Psychological Problems in Families Facing the COVID-19 Outbreak in Italy","<b>Objectives:</b> The present study aimed to explore the effect of risk factors associated with the COVID-19 outbreak experience on parents' and children's well-being. <b>Methods:</b> Parents of children aged between 2- and 14-years-old completed an online survey reporting their home environment conditions, any relation they had to the pandemic consequences, their difficulties experienced due to the quarantine, their perception of individual and parent-child dyadic stress, and their children's emotional and behavioral problems. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that the perception of the difficulty of quarantine is a crucial factor that undermines both parents' and children's well-being. Quarantine's impact on children's behavioral and emotional problems is mediated by parent's individual and dyadic stress, with a stronger effect from the latter. Parents who reported more difficulties in dealing with quarantine show more stress. This, in turn, increases the children's problems. Living in a more at-risk area, the quality of the home environment, or the relation they have with the pandemic consequences, do not have an effect on families' well-being. <b>Conclusions:</b> Dealing with quarantine is a particularly stressful experience for parents who must balance personal life, work, and raising children, being left alone without other resources. This situation puts parents at a higher risk of experiencing distress, potentially impairing their ability to be supportive caregivers. The lack of support these children receive in such a difficult moment may be the reason for their more pronounced psychological symptoms. Policies should take into consideration the implications of the lockdown for families' mental health, and supportive interventions for the immediate and for the future should be promoted.","Spinelli, Lionetti, Pastore, Fasolo","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01713","20200728","COVID-19; children; children behavioral problems; children emotional problems; parent stress; parents","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3508,""
"Covid-19 and the cardiovascular system: a comprehensive review","Cardiac injury in patients infected with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) seems to be associated with higher morbimortality. We provide a broad review of the clinical evolution of COVID-19, emphasizing its impact and implications on the cardiovascular system. The pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is characterized by overproduction of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-ÃŽÂ±) leading to systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acutely affecting the cardiovascular system. HypertensionÃ‚Â (56.6%) and diabetes (33.8%) are the most prevalent comorbidities among individuals with COVID-19, who require hospitalization. Furthermore, cardiac injury, defined as elevated us-troponin I, significantly relates to inflammation biomarkers (IL-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), hyperferritinemia, and leukocytosis), portraying an important correlation between myocardial injury and inflammatory hyperactivity triggered by viral infection. Increased risk for myocardial infarction, fulminant myocarditis rapidly evolving with depressed systolic left ventricle function, arrhythmias, venous thromboembolism, and cardiomyopathies mimicking STEMI presentations are the most prevalent cardiovascular complications described in patients with COVID-19. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 tropism and interaction with the RAAS system, through ACE2 receptor, possibly enhances inflammation response and cardiac aggression, leading to imperative concerns about the use of ACEi and ARBs in infected patients. Cardiovascular implications result in a worse prognosis in patients with COVID-19, emphasizing the importance of precocious detection and implementation of optimal therapeutic strategies.","Azevedo, Botelho, Hollanda, Ferreira, Junqueira de Andrade, Oei, Mello, Muxfeldt","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41371-020-0387-4","20200728","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3509,""
"Sedentarism and chronic disease risk in COVID 19 lockdown - a scoping review","Though viewed as a critical measure to prevent the spread of the virus, a prolonged homestay may result in unfavourable sedentary behaviour and chronic disease risk. This systematic review focuses on sedentary behaviour resulting from this quarantine period which may elevate the cardiovascular disease risk, obesity, hypertension, cancer and mental health illness. Evidence of breaking sedentary behaviour and global recommendations were investigated. Potential unanswered questions regarding sedentary behaviour and physical activity during lockdown were explored. Five systematic reviews and six prospective trials explored the effect of sedentarism affecting chronic disease through potential pathophysiological mechanisms. Sedentary behaviour especially prolonged sitting is found to be a pleiotropic risk factor with altered energy expenditure, adipogenic signalling, immunomodulation, autonomic stability and hormonal dysregulation perpetuating underlying chronic diseases such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, cancer and mental health disorders. Breaking sitting and physical activity are found to reverse the adverse effects associated with excessive sitting during the lockdown.","Chandrasekaran, Ganesan","https://doi.org/10.1177/0036933020946336","20200728","Sitting; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; exercise; obesity; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-07-29","",3510,""
"Polygenic Risk Score for Smoking is associated with Externalizing Psychopathology and Disinhibited Personality Traits but not Internalizing Psychopathology in Adolescence","Importance: Large consortia of genome wide association studies have yielded more accurate polygenic risk scores (PRS) that aggregate the small effects of many genetic variants to characterize the genetic architecture of disorders and provide a personalized measure of genetic risk. Objective: We examined whether a PRS for smoking measured genetic risk for general behavioral disinhibition by estimating its associations with externalizing and internalizing psychopathology and related personality traits. We examined these associations at multiple time points in adolescence using more refined phenotypes defined by stable characteristics across time and at young ages, which reduced potential confounds associated with cumulative exposure to substances and reverse causality. Methods: Random intercept panel models were fit to symptoms of conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and teacher ratings of externalizing and internalizing problems and personality traits at ages 11, 14, and 17 years-old in the Minnesota Twin Family Study (N = 3225). Results: The smoking PRS had strong associations with the random intercept factors for all the externalizing measures (mean standardized <U+A7B5> = .27), agreeableness (<U+A7B5>=-.22, 95% CI: -.28, -.16), and conscientiousness (<U+A7B5>=-.19, 95% CI: -.24, -.13), but was not significantly associated with the internalizing measures (mean <U+A7B5> = .06) or extraversion (<U+A7B5>=.01, 95% CI: -.05, .07). After controlling for smoking at age 17, the associations with the externalizing measures (mean <U+A7B5> = .13) and personality traits related to behavioral control (mean <U+A7B5> = -.10) remained statistically significant. Conclusions and Relevance: The smoking PRS measures genetic influences that contribute to a spectrum of phenotypes related to behavioral disinhibition including externalizing psychopathology and normal-range personality traits related to behavioral control, but not internalizing psychopathology. Continuing to identify the correlates and delineate the mechanisms of the genetic influences associated with disinhibition could have substantial impact in mitigating a variety of public health problems (e.g., mental health, academic achievement, criminality).","Brian M.
