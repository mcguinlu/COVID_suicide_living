"Loneliness and diurnal cortisol levels during COVID-19 lockdown: the roles of living situation, relationship status and relationship quality","Loneliness and social isolation have become increasing concerns during COVID-19 lockdown through neuroendocrine stress-reactions, physical and mental health problems. We investigated living situation, relationship status and quality as potential moderators for trait and state loneliness and salivary cortisol levels (hormonal stress-responses) in healthy adults during the first lockdown in Germany. N=1242 participants (mean age = 36.32, 78% female) filled out an online questionnaire on demographics, trait loneliness and relationship quality. Next, N=247 (mean age = 32.6, 70% female) completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA), collecting twelve saliva samples on two days and simultaneously reporting their momentary loneliness levels. Divorced/widowed showed highest trait loneliness, followed by singles and partnerships. The latter displayed lower momentary loneliness and cortisol levels compared to singles. Relationship satisfaction significantly reduced loneliness levels in participants with a partner and those who were living apart from their partner reported loneliness levels similar to singles living alone. Living alone was associated with lower loneliness levels. Hierarchical linear models revealed a significant cross-level interaction between relationship status and momentary loneliness in predicting cortisol. The results imply that widowhood, being single, living alone and low relationship quality represent risk factors for loneliness and having a partner buffers neuroendocrine stress responses during lockdown.","Dora Hopf; Ekaterina Schneider; Corina Aguilar-Raab; Dirk Scheele; Beate Ditzen; Monika Eckstein","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.25.22271461","20220226","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27540,""
"Psychosocial factors associated with mental health and quality of life during the COVID-19 pandemic among low-income urban dwellers in Peninsular Malaysia","Background and aims The mental well-being among low-income urban populations is arguably challenged more than any other population amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This study investigates factors associated with depression and anxiety symptoms, and quality of life among Malaysias multi-ethnic urban lower-income communities. Methods This is a community-based house-to-house survey conducted from September to November 2020 at the Petaling district in Selangor, Malaysia. Five hundred and four households were identified using random sampling, and heads of eligible households were recruited. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years with monthly household income <=RM6960 (estimated USD 1600) without acute psychiatric illness. The PHQ-9, GAD-7 and EQ-5D were used for depression, anxiety, and quality of life. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for the final analysis. Results A total of 432 (85.7%) respondents with a mean age of 43.1 years completed the survey. Mild to severe depression was detected in 29.6%, mild to severe anxiety in 14.7%, and problematic quality of life in 27.8% of respondents. Factors associated with mild to severe depression were younger age, chronic health conditions, past stressful events, lack of communication gadgets and lack of assets or commercial property. While respiratory diseases, marital status, workplace issues, financial constraints, absence of investments, substance use and lack of rental income were associated with mild to severe anxiety. Not attributing poverty to structural issues, help-seeking from professionals, and self-stigma were barriers, while resiliency facilitated good psychological health. Problematic quality of life was associated with depression, older age, unemployment, cash shortage, hypertension, diabetes, stressful life events and low health literacy. Conclusions A higher proportion had reported mild to severe anxiety and depression symptoms in the sampled urban poor population than previous pre-pandemic reports. The psychosocial determinants should inform policy and direct future research within this underserved population.","Wong Min Fui; Hazreen Abdul Majid; Rozmi Ismail; Tin Tin Su; Tan Maw Pin; Mas Ayu Said","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.21.22271310","20220225","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27541,""
"Health Provider and Sexual and Gender Minority Service User Perspectives on Provision of Mental Health Services During the Early Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic in British Columbia, Canada","While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted everyone, social determinants of health and structural inequities have had compounding effects that shaped the experiences of some sub-populations during the pandemic. Stigmatization, discrimination, and exclusion contribute to a disproportionately high burden of mental health concerns among sexual minority (i.e., lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, and other sexually-diverse) and gender minority people. Pre-pandemic, these health inequities are exacerbated by barriers to adequate mental health services including cost, waitlists, and experiences of sexual and gender minority stigma when accessing providers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these barriers were further complicated by drastic changes in service delivery and access during the pandemic (i.e., a shift to online/virtual provision of care to reduce risk of COVID-19 transmission). To better understand the experiences of sexual and gender minority people accessing mental health services during the first three to nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of 15 health care providers and administrators (summer 2020) and 14 sexual and gender minority individuals interested in accessing mental health services (fall 2020) in British Columbia, Canada. We used interpretive description to inductively analyze interview data. Triangulating between the provider and service user datasets, we examined changes in mental health and coping during the COVID-19 pandemic. We recorded increases in isolation and lack of identity affirmation; inequities in accessing mental health services during the pandemic, perceived opportunities for mental health support, and avenues for reducing mental health inequities through system-level changes that deserve particular attention during the pandemic.","Angel M Kennedy; StÃ©phanie Black; Sarah Watt; Natasha Vitkin; James Young; Rowdy Reeves; Travis Salway","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.18.22271151","20220225","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27542,""
"Characterization of various remdesivir-resistant mutations of SARS-CoV-2 by mathematical modeling and molecular dynamics simulation","Mutations continue to accumulate within the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and the ongoing epidemic has shown no signs of ending. It is critical to predict problematic mutations that may arise in clinical environments and assess their properties in advance to quickly implement countermeasures against future variant infections. In this study, we identified mutations resistant to remdesivir, which is widely administered to SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and discuss the cause of resistance. First, we simultaneously constructed eight recombinant viruses carrying the mutations detected in in vitro serial passages of SARS-CoV-2 in the presence of remdesivir. Time course analyses of cellular virus infections showed significantly higher infectious titers and infection rates in mutant viruses than wild type virus under treatment with remdesivir. Next, we developed a mathematical model in consideration of the changing dynamic of cells infected with mutant viruses with distinct propagation properties and defined that mutations detected in in vitro passages canceled the antiviral activities of remdesivir without raising virus production capacity. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations of the NSP12 protein of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that the molecular vibration around the RNA-binding site was increased by the introduction of mutations on NSP12. Taken together, we identified multiple mutations that affected the flexibility of the RNA binding site and decreased the antiviral activity of remdesivir. Our new insights will contribute to developing further antiviral measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Significance StatementConsidering the emerging Omicron strain, quick characterization of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is important. However, owing to the difficulties in genetically modifying SARS-CoV-2, limited groups have produced multiple mutant viruses. Our cutting-edge reverse genetics technique enabled construction of eight reporter-carrying mutant SARS-CoV-2 in this study. We developed a mathematical model taking into account sequential changes and identified antiviral effects against mutant viruses with differing propagation capacities and lethal effects on cells. In addition to identifying the positions of mutations, we analyzed the structural changes in SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 by computer simulation to understand the mechanism of resistance. This multidisciplinary approach promotes the evaluation of future resistance mutations.","Shiho Torii; Kwang Su Kim; Jun Koseki; Rigel Suzuki; Shoya Iwanami; Yasuhisa Fujita; Yong Dam Jeong; Yoshiharu Matsuura; Teppei Shimamura; Shingo Iwami; Takasuke Fukuhara","https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.02.22.481436","20220224","","bioRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27543,""

"Determining the appropriate use of Technology Enabled Care Services (TECS) to manage upper limb trauma injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multicentre retrospective observational study","Background : The COVID-19 pandemic created a unique opportunity to explore the use of Technology Enabled Care Services (TECS), which remains novel for many service providers. This study assesses the factors that affect adaptation to remote monitoring of patients following upper limb trauma injury. A standardised risk-stratified screening tool is further developed here to support clinical staff in both the determination of appropriate use of TECS and the optimisation of patient care Objectives : 1: Explore the patient and injury factors that determine the appropriate use of TECS for patients with upper limb injury. 2: Use these findings to refine a standardised screening tool for the appropriate choice of follow-up format. Methods : A retrospective review of patient management was undertaken across three NHS upper limb trauma units during the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. Data was collected and themes analysed across a number of predetermined categories. This was underpinned by a review of contemporary policy guidance and literature. Results : 85% of patients were offered an appropriate format of follow-up;this was defined by the ability to achieve desired patient-clinician goals and lack of complications. Key factors in determining appropriate follow-up included extent of injury, mental health considerations and the need for face-to-face (F2F) assessment and treatment. Conclusion : Study findings demonstrate consistency between units in the factors determining appropriate use of TECS. The refined screening tool provides a risk-stratified, standardised approach to the choice of follow-up format;F2F or TECS. It is hoped that this will support future clinical decision-making processes to ensure optimal patient care.","Sayed, L.; Valand, P.; Brewin, M.

"Impact of the COVID 19 Pandemic on Daily Life, Mood and Behavior of Adults with Down Syndrome","Background The Down syndrome population has been disproportionately affected by Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) in terms of experiencing severe illness and death. Societal efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 may also have taken a heavy toll on the daily lives of individuals with Down syndrome. Objective/Hypothesis The goal of the study was to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has altered daily life (including residence, employment, and participation in adult disability day programs) and influenced the mood and behavior of adults with Down syndrome. Methods Between September 2020 and February 2021, caregivers of 171 adults with Down syndrome (aged 22 -66 years) located across the United States and in the United Kingdom enrolled in the Alzheimerâ€™s Biomarker Research Consortium - Down syndrome (ABC-DS) completed a survey. Results The residence of 17% of individuals was altered and 89% of those who had been employed stopped working during the pandemic. One-third (33%) of individuals were reported to be more irritable or easily angered, 52% were reported to be more anxious, and 41% were reported to be more sad/depressed/unhappy relative to pre-pandemic. The majority of changes in mood and behavior were of modest severity. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has had widespread effects on the daily life and mood and behavior of adults with Down syndrome. In the short-term, caregivers and providers should be prepared to help adults with Down syndrome with changes in daily routines, residence, employment, or adult disability day programs as society shifts away from COVID-19 safety protocols.","Hartley, Sigan L.; Fleming, Victoria, Piro-Gambetti, Brianna, Cohen, Annie, Ances, Beau M.; Yassa, Michael A.; Brickman, Adam M.; Handen, Benjamin L.; Head, Elizabeth, Mapstone, Mark E.; Christian, Bradley T.; Lott, Ira T.; Doran, Eric, Zaman, Shahid, Krinsky-McHale, Sharon, Schmitt, Fredrick A.; Hom, Christy, Schupf, Nicole","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dhjo.2022.101278","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Disability and Health Journal;: 101278, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27547,""
"A rapid ethnographic study of risk negotiation during the COVID-19 pandemic among unstably housed people who use drugs in Rhode Island","Background The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly exacerbated the United Statesâ€™ overdose crisis. However, the overlapping impacts of COVID-19 and the overdose crisis have not been experienced equally, with unstably housed people who use drugs (PWUD) disproportionately impacted. Amid these changes, there is a need to understand how risk is experienced and managed among unstably housed PWUD to address health and social needs more effectively. Methods This project draws on ethnographic research conducted from June 2020 to April 2021 in Rhode Island. Data include 39 in-depth interviews with unstably housed PWUD and approximately 50 hours of ethnographic fieldwork conducted alongside street-based outreach workers. Results COVID-19 risks were primarily contextualized in relation to participantsâ€™ prior experiences of overdose events and adverse health outcomes. However, participants had varying levels of risk tolerance that were managed in ways that allowed them to reassert control and agency within the uncertainty of overlapping public health crises. Given participantsâ€™ level of structural vulnerabilities, COVID-19 risk was managed alongside meeting their basic needs to survive. Conclusions Findings demonstrate how COVID-related public health measures (e.g., stay-at-home orders, service closures) reinforced participantsâ€™ structural vulnerabilities in ways that increased their risk of health and social harms. Implementing and scaling up programs that meet the basic needs of individuals, including permanent housing, social supports, and overdose prevention interventions (e.g., supervised consumption sites) is critically needed to address intersecting risks faced by unstably housed PWUD.","Collins, Alexandra B.; Edwards, Sarah, McNeil, Ryan, Goldman, Jacqueline, Hallowell, Benjamin D.; Scagos, Rachel P.; Marshall, Brandon D.

"Burden of Covid-19 restrictions: National, regional and global estimates","Summary Background A growing literature has documented the high global morbidity, mortality and mental health burden associated with the current Covid-19 pandemic. In this paper, we aimed to quantify the total utility and quality of life loss resulting from Covid-19-related government restrictions imposed at the national, regional and global levels. Methods We conducted quality of life online surveys in France, India, Italy, UK and the United States of America between June 21st and September 13th 2021, and used regression models to estimate the average quality of life loss due to light and severe restrictions in these countries. We then combined estimated disutility weights from the pooled sample with the latest data on Covid-19 restrictions exposure in each country to estimate the total disutility generated by restrictions at the national, regional and global level. We also embedded a discrete choice experiment (DCE) into the online survey to estimate average willingness to pay to avoid specific restrictions. Findings A total of 947 surveys were completed. Thirty-five percent of respondents were female, and 69.5% were between 18 and 39 years old. The weighted average utility weight was 0.71 (95% CIs 0.69â€“0.74) for light restrictions, and 0.65 (0.63â€“0.68) for severe restrictions. At the global scale, this implies a total loss of 3259 million QALYs (95% 3021, 3496) as of September 6th, 2021, with the highest burden in lower and upper middle-income countries. Utility losses appear to be particularly large for closures of schools and daycares as well as restaurants and bars, and seem relatively small for wearing masks and travel restrictions. Interpretation The results presented here suggest that the QALY losses due to restrictions are substantial. Future mitigation strategies should try to balance potential reductions in disease transmission achievable through specific measures against their respective impact on quality of life. Additional research is needed to determine differences in restriction-specific disutilities across countries, and to determine optimal policy responses to similar future disease threats.

"Measurement and community antecedents of positive mental health among the survivors of typhoons Vamco and Goni during the COVID-19 crisis in the Philippines","The present study examined the measurement and antecedents of positive mental health in people who concurrently experienced two disasters of different nature (i.e., typhoons and COVID-19 crisis), focusing on the survivors of typhoons Vamco and Goni that hit the Philippines in November 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we investigated the psychometric properties of Mental Health Continuum-Short Form (MHC-SF), a well-validated measure of positive mental health dimensions (i.e., emotional, social, and psychological well-being) by: 1) comparing the structural validity of three measurement models including a single-factor, bifactor, and three-factor solutions of positive mental health;2) looking into the criterion validity through correlating the MHC-SF subscales with relevant measures;and 3) calculating for item reliability. Second, we examined the mediating role of social responsibility in the positive influence of community resilience on the three dimensions of positive mental health. Using 447 participants, with ages ranging from 18 to 70 years old, confirmatory factor analysis showed that compared to the single-factor and the bifactor models, the intercorrelated three-factor model of MHC-SF has the best model fit and most stable factor loadings. MHC-SF subscales correlated with relevant measures indicating criterion validity and yielded excellent internal consistency for all subscales. Additionally, results showed that social responsibility mediated the positive impact of community resilience on emotional, social, and psychological well-being of Filipinos in times of great adversities. The findings were discussed within the context of extreme weather events and the COVID-19 crisis in the Philippines, highlighting implications on disaster preparedness and mental health policies at the community level.","Aruta, John Jamir Benzon R.; Crisostomo, Karina A.; Canlas, Nenuca Fe, Almazan, Joseph U.; PeÃ±aranda, Gerald","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijdrr.2022.102853","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction; 72:102853, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27551,""

"Four-month incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among healthcare workers after the first wave of the Spain COVID-19 pandemic","Healthcare workers (HCW) are at high risk for suicide, yet little is known about the onset of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) in this important segment of the population in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a multicenter, prospective cohort study of Spanish HCW active during the COVID-9 pandemic. A total of nÂ =Â 4809 HCW participated at baseline (Mayâ€“September 2020;i.e., just after the first wave of the pandemic) and at a four-month follow-up assessment (Octoberâ€“December 2020) using web-based surveys. Logistic regression assessed the individual- and population-level associations of separate proximal (pandemic) risk factors with four-month STB incidence (i.e., 30-day STB among HCW negative for 30-day STB at baseline), each time adjusting for distal (pre-pandemic) factors. STB incidence was estimated at 4.2% (SEÂ =Â 0.5;nÂ =Â 1 suicide attempt). Adjusted for distal factors, proximal risk factors most strongly associated with STB incidence were various sources of interpersonal stress (scaled 0â€“4;odds ratio [OR] rangeÂ =Â 1.23â€“1.57) followed by personal health-related stress and stress related to the health of loved ones (scaled 0â€“4;OR range 1.30â€“1.32), and the perceived lack of healthcare center preparedness (scaled 0â€“4;ORÂ =Â 1.34). Population-attributable risk proportions for these proximal risk factors were in the range 45.3â€“57.6%. Other significant risk factors were financial stressors (OR range 1.26â€“1.81), isolation/quarantine due to COVID-19 (ORÂ =Â 1.53) and having changed to a specific COVID-19 related work location (ORÂ =Â 1.72). Among other interventions, our findings call for healthcare systems to implement adequate conflict communication and resolution strategies and to improve family-work balance embedded in organizational justice strategies.","Mortier, P.; Vilagut, G.; Alayo, I.; Ferrer, M.; Amigo, F.; AragonÃ¨s, E.; AragÃ³n-PeÃ±a, A.; AsÃºnsolo del Barco, A.; Campos, M.; Espuga, M.; GonzÃ¡lez-Pinto, A.; Haro, J.

Diagnosing depression during adolescence is complex due to the variety of manifestations encountered. Besides, depression is a common comorbidity in autism spectrum disorders and can be difficult to diagnose. We report here the case of a 17-year-old adolescent hospitalized for major hetero-aggressive behavior in a context of melancholic depression. We present the multidisciplinary care provided: psychotherapeutic, medication, family, and body packing. The case of this patient was complex due to multiple â€œinternalâ€ constraints linked to comorbidities (autism spectrum disorder, coordination impairment, attention disorder, sluggish cognitive tempo), as well as â€œexternalâ€ constraints (complicated family context, worsening of disorders coinciding with the start of the SARS-cov-19Â epidemic and the closure of the day hospital supporting him). These factors raised important questions in the choice of treatments for this patient, required several months of hospitalization and opened a discussion around differential diagnoses.","Kaminska, N.; Oppetit, A.; Gallien, M.; Vachez-Gatecel, A.; Aouidad, A.; Cohen, D.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neurenf.2022.01.005","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Neuropsychiatrie de l'Enfance et de l'Adolescence;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27554,""
"Suicidal ideation during COVID-19: The contribution of unique and cumulative stressors","The link between large-scale disasters and population-level risk of suicide remains unclear. The present study sought to investigate suicidal ideation (SI) in relation to COVID-19 related stress, including material and social stress, in a predominantly low-SES ethno-racially diverse sample in New York City during a peak in COVID-19 cases in April 2020. Using binary logistic regressions of data collected with self-report surveys, we found that individuals who identified as Asian, as well as those with high total, material, and social stress levels, and persons without access to primary care providers had significantly higher adjusted odds of SI. These results indicate the specific burden faced by Asian participants due to increases in targeted racism, the importance of cumulative stress and specific stressor type, as well as the role of healthcare access on SI during the pandemic. Such findings suggest the need for specific interventions that target individuals who may be at higher risk of suicide after large-scale traumatic events and during the ongoing pandemic.","Rudenstine, Sasha, Schulder, Talia, Bhatt, Krish J.; McNeal, Kat, Ettman, Catherine K.; Galea, Sandro","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2022.114475","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychiatry Research;: 114475, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27555,""
"Is a pandemic as good as a rest? Comparing athlete burnout and stress before and after the suspension of organised team sport due to Covid-19 restrictions, and investigating the impact of athletesâ€™ responses to this period","The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in social-distancing measures and the suspension of organised sport globally, and has been shown to have negatively impacted mental health. However, athletes may have experienced reprieve from sport demands, which have previously been linked with maladaptive responses such as burnout and stress. The aims of this study were (1) compare levels of burnout and stress reported by Gaelic games athletes pre- and post-COVID-19 suspension period, (2) explore how athletes utilised and perceived this period and the return to sport, and (3) examine the implications of this for burnout. Participants completed an online questionnaire, which included the athlete burnout questionnaire, perceived stress scale, sport emotion questionnaire, demographic questions, weekly training hours, and other hours for sport (e.g. travel) before Covid-19 (BC-19) and after the Covid-19-induced suspension (AC-19). Questions relating to how athletes utilised (e.g. training focus) and perceived (positive/negative impact) the period were included AC-19. Data was compared across time-points and we explored predictors of burnout AC-19.Ninety-two athletes completed the questionnaire at both time-points. No significant differences in burnout or stress were identified, suggesting the suspension period did not significantly impact these variables. Burnout BC-19, stress AC-19, unpleasant emotions about returning to sport and using the period to rest/recover positively predicted burnout AC-19. Reduction in other hours across time-points and pleasant emotions about returning predicted lower burnout. Results suggest an athletesâ€™ response to a suspension period and subsequent return to sport can impact feelings of burnout, and may have implications for future unanticipated change events.","Woods, SiobhÃ¡n, Dunne, Simon, Gallagher, Pamela, Harney, SibÃ©al","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychsport.2022.102168","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: Psychology of Sport and Exercise;: 102168, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27556,""
"Benefits, concerns, and perceptions of knowledge workers regarding a video Stress Detection software","Introduction: Stress is not only highly destructive, causing various mental health disorders (anxiety, insomnia, depression), cardiovascular diseases, poor immune function, and presenteeism, as it is costly. While concerns about occupational stress have increased, new solutions for its management have emerged. Systems based on the use of facial recognition, posture, eye movements, video monitoring, and behavioral stress detection have shown good results. Their drawback has mainly been the recording of the said video feed and privacy threats proceeding. This Focus Groups aimed to raise the opinions, perceptions, and concerns of end users regarding the system under development. Material and Methods: With a new solution in mind, we gathered two groups of knowledge workers, one group of team leaders, and a group of consulting psychologists to gather their perceptions. A Focus Groups was conducted online via Microsoft Teams, as COVID-19 restrictions were applied during that period. Results: Against previous reports, knowledge workers showed that privacy threats were not their major concern. Both groups showed that Mental Health was their main focus as the follow-up structure regarding stress detection was the most prevalent topic being close to information sharing and software adaptation. Conclusions: The results highly contribute to the development of future stress detection applications/software and the importance of a detailed and thorough explanation regarding the software framework.","Rodrigues, M.; Ferreira, S.; Figueiredo, H.; Rodrigues, F.; Moreira, F.; Costa, L.; Rocha, N.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.shaw.2021.12.1717","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Safety and Health at Work; 13:S308-S309, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27557,""
"Connectedness in the time of COVID-19: Reddit as a source of support for coping with suicidal thinking","The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting suicidality at a population level, with consequences resulting from a variety of pandemic-driven disruptions, including social activities and connectedness. This paper uses a single case study design to explore how members of the Reddit r/COVID19_support community create a sense of connectedness among those who have suicidal thoughts due to the pandemic. Data were gathered from posts to the r/COVID19_support subreddit forum from February 2020 through December 2020. The second step of Klonsky and May's (2015) Three-Step Theory (3ST) of suicide, connectedness as a key protective factor, was used as the theoretical framework. This study explored r/COVID19_support's constructed environment, users' dialogical interactions, and the four primary tenets of connectedness as proposed by Klonsky and May â€“ Purpose and Meaning, Relationships, Religiosity, and Employment. Findings demonstrate a deep sense of connectedness for online community members. Relationships and Purpose and Meaning featured as the most salient sources of connectedness within this subreddit, whereas Religiosity was rarely discussed, and Employment was often spoken of in negative terms (i.e., creating mental distress, rather than facilitating connectedness). Contributors' responses offered various opportunities for connectedness both on- and off-line. Safe online spaces, such as r/COVID19_support, can serve as a protective factor amid suicidality, facilitating connectedness, and thereby helping to curtail suicidal thoughts from advancing to suicidal actions. This subreddit and similar online spaces can benefit specific populations who may otherwise find it challenging to access services or who wish to remain anonymous.","McAuliffe, Corey, Slemon, Allie, Goodyear, Trevor, McGuinness, Liza, Shaffer, Elizabeth, Jenkins, Emily K.","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmqr.2022.100062","","Database: ScienceDirect; Publication type: article; Publication details: SSM - Qualitative Research in Health;: 100062, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27558,""
"COVID-19 Post-Vaccination Depression in Older Israeli Adults: The Role of Negative World Assumptions","Background: With the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the aging population has been shown to be highly vulnerable. As a result, policy makers and the media urged older adults to restrict social interactions, placing them at greater risk of mental health problems, such as depression. However, there has been little previous attempt to examine COVID-19 vaccine related risk factors and depressive symptoms amongst older adults. Methods: Participants (938 older adults, Mage=68.99, SD=3.41, range 65-85) answered an online questionnaire at the start of the COVID-19 vaccination program in Israel. Participants completed measures of background characteristics, world assumptions, COVID-19 vaccine related variables, and symptoms of depression. Results: Univariate logistic regression revealed that more negative world assumptions were linked with clinical depression levels. Conclusions: Older adults in our sample were susceptible to unique factors associated with clinical depression influenced by their world assumptions during their COVID-19 vaccination. The high level of depression following vaccination indicates that it may take time to recover from depression associated with pandemic distress. Cognitive interventions that focus on world assumptions are recommended.","Greenblatt-Kimron, L.; Hoffman, Y.; Ben-Ezra, M.; Goodwin, R.; Palgi, Y.","https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2022.11","","Database: EMBASE; Publication type: article; Publication details: Global Mental Health;2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27559,""
"'Losing the illusion of control and predictability of life': experiences of grief and loss among ageing US adults during the COVID-19 pandemic","Bereavement and grief are frequently experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic given widespread mortality. However, losses extend beyond deaths to include cancelled plans and routines, separation from family and friends, and unemployment. It is essential to better understand the multifaceted and complex losses experienced by older adults throughout the pandemic. We analysed 2,587 open-ended survey responses collected online in May to July 2020 from the COVID-19 Coping Study, a mixed-methods study of US adults aged 55 and older. Participants were on average 67 years old (standard deviation = 7.2), over two-thirds female and largely white. Qualitative thematic analysis identified diverse sources of grief, sadness and loss. Themes ranged from death and bereavement to anticipatory grief, loss of agency, cancelled plans and missed milestones, losing social contact and physical touch, health struggles, loss of normalcy and daily routines, and societal and economic woes. The results highlight the varied and highly personal nature of everyday grief and loss among ageing adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sources of grief extended beyond death to include both tangible and intangible losses with expectations of long-term consequences. These findings may inform the development of family and community supports, including mental health services, to address complex subjective experiences of grief and loss since the pandemic onset. Interventions are needed to support healing and hope in vulnerable and resilient ageing populations.","Statz, T. L.; Kobayashi, L. C.; Finlay, J.

"Teaching, Self-Care, and Reflective Practice during a Pandemic","Political science courses often address difficult topics that can take an emotional and psychological toll on students, including burnout, compassion fatigue, and vicarious traumatization. There is a growing awareness of the importance of reflective and self-care practices in teaching, especially considering the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health. However, this is a rarely discussed topic in political science. This article discusses the results of our pedagogical research on the emotional impact of learning about atrocities, the challenges of studying during a global pandemic, and the benefits of self-care activities (e.g., meditation) for student well-being. Our research is based on two different courses and includes student self-reflections and our analysis of class discussions. We conclude that our students struggle with the emotional costs of studying difficult topics (especially during the pandemic) and are receptive to doing self-care activities and find them beneficial for their mental health.","Vanderhill, R.; Dorroll, C.","https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096521001918","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Ps-Political Science & Politics;: 5, 2022.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27561,""
"Metaphors, powerlessness and online aggression How Wuhan lockdown escapees were dehumanised during the COVID-19 pandemic","A lockdown was imposed in Wuhan, China, the alleged epicentre of the COVID-19 outbreak, on 23 January 2020. Rattled by the short notice and severity of the restrictions, many grabbed the last opportunity to escape, an act widely criticised on Weibo, China's popular microblogging site. This study aims to examine the unsavoury discourse deployed by Weibo users to express impoliteness and discursively construct negative identities of the lockdown escapees. Posts on Weibo criticising, reporting and threatening the escapees were analysed, revealing that the escapees were dehumanised through vivid animal metaphors to highlight their irresponsibility and call for their punishment. Animal metaphors can co-occur with various impoliteness triggers to intensify offensiveness, heightening the hostility of interlocutors towards a target. This use of metaphors also showcases online users' anger, distrust, and hatred towards the escapees, their solidarity-seeking behaviour online and their irrationality.","Ho, J.","https://doi.org/10.1075/jlac.00073.ho","","Database: Web of Science; Publication type: article; Publication details: Journal of Language Aggression and Conflict;: 24, 2021.","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27562,""
"Mental Health, Wellness, and Resilience for Transit System Workers [Project]","Transit system workers have traditionally been subject to chronic and acute stressors that can contribute to mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, burnout, and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). In turn, these issues can lead to increased risk of injuries and chronic diseases, workplace dysfunction, safety issues, presenteeism, absenteeism, turnover, and cost impacts. The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, and the ongoing pandemic add another layer of stressors on essential workers including transit system workers. There have been media reports about transit workers exposed to the virus and falling ill, and several hundred have died. The mental health implications of the pandemic with its risk of exposure, illness, and potential death has not been widely examined, nor has the relationship between employee mental health and the effect of these issues on recruitment and retention. The pandemic compounds the chronic stressors with a unique set of acute stressors that are amplified by the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous nature of the pandemic. These include potential personal exposure to the virus, as well as the potential to expose family members;the shortage or delay of engineering controls;lack of personal protective equipment (PPE);and the problems associated with social distancing, job uncertainty, layoffs, physical and verbal assaults, extended or shortened hours, and disruption of work schedules and tasks. The most effective and efficient way to provide relevant and actionable information to transit systems on these topics would be to study the mental health, wellness, and resilience of transit workers, as well as programs, policies and practices of transit systems in addressing these issues. This will require examining the chronic stressors and outcomes in pre-pandemic times and then exploring the acute stressors of trying to survive in highly exposed occupations, amid a pandemic. It will also require exploring transit systemsâ€™ workplace culture, including labor-management relations and work organization, and assessing whether the culture contributes to the mental health of employees. The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive guidebook and interactive products that would assist transit agencies and other stakeholders in exploring or implementing approaches to identify and mitigate the factors that cause negative impacts on mental health, wellness, and resilience for transit system workers. Some examples of products may include fact sheets, toolkits, checklists, a resource guide, training curricula, and/or interactive products or other methods for sharing and disseminating the information. A sustainability plan for the ongoing use of the products should be included. The project will address both organizational and individual level factors affecting mental health. Such factors might include, but are not limited to, financial challenges, job insecurity, assaults, schedules, lack of childcare and in-person school uncertainty, knowing victims, and constantly wearing PPE that contribute to the stress and mental health challenges. Support mechanisms at an individual or organizational level can also be included, such as employee assistance programs and perceived social support and other similar resources.","Missing], [Data","http://apps.trb.org/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=5069","","Database: TRID Database; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27563,""
"Mobility Challenges of Female Minority Workforce During the Coronavirus Pandemic [Project]","The coronavirus pandemic has created widespread effects on individuals, families, and communities throughout the world. Coupled with political disputes and racial discrimination, this pandemic has brought unprecedented fear, pessimism, and despair to the female workforce, especially women of color in the U.S. Too many unknowns make it impossible to predict exactly how women and families will react to the ever-shifting landscape of public health, employment status, caregiving, and job access. This project aims to give quantified answers to two research questions: (1) What is the impact of the pandemic-induced mobility change among the female minority workforce? (2) How much such a situation has been evolved during the pandemic? What are the possible implications for long-term gender equity and the well-being of women and families? The significance of this project is to investigate gender equity issues in workplaces and homes and identify solutions that can better prepare the vulnerable group, female minority workforce, to be resilient to emergencies like the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. Census has implemented a three-phase Household Pulse Survey to measure the social and economic impacts during the coronavirus pandemic. With rich individual-level socioeconomic data collected, this project will analyze how the effect of socio-demographic factors, income and employment status, housing insecurity, food scarcity, household expense, and social welfare jointly impact the mobility options of the female minority workforce during the coronavirus pandemic. Where mobility change is measured by reduced trip frequency, teleworking or not, reduced use of public transit and shared mobility, and the history of long-distance travels. In addition, with the changing responsive actions from governmental agencies, the challenges that the female minority workforce is confronted with is also changing. Whether governmental responses to the pandemic over time are effective need to be evaluated.","Missing], [Data","https://trid.trb.org/view/1878052","","Database: TRID Database; GREY-COVIDWHO; Publication type: non-conventional","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27564,""
"Long COVID: Pathophysiology â€“ epidemiology and patient needs","Objectives:The current KCE-study aims to provide information to policy makers to be used as one of the building blocks in the decision making process about which health care services and reimbursement rules are required for people with long COVID. In addition we aim to inform the general public as well as healthcare professionals about the scientific insights in long-COVID. More in particular we will focus on three main research parts: - Literature review on the epidemiology and pathophysiology of long COVID: How can long COVID be defined? How frequent is it? What are the most common symptoms? Which are the risk factors? What are the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms? - Patient survey and interviews: What are the needs and experiences of patients with long COVID complaints? - Analysis of current Belgian legislation and reimbursement rules: Which (reimbursed) services exist in Belgium to care for patients with long-COVID complaints? Conclusions:As described in the chapter on the epidemiology, patients living with long COVID constitute a heterogeneous group of population and suffer from a wide range of symptoms with different levels of severity and impact on everyday life. Moreover, there are still many unknowns about the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, the diagnostic criteria, the duration of symptoms, patientsâ€™ needs, effectiveness of management and treatment approach, etc. Given all these uncertainties it is difficult to assess to what extent the Belgian healthcare system is able to absorb the needs of long COVID patients or to advise which and for whom changes are needed. However over the last years several research projects have been attempting at improving the management of the needs of complex (and chronic) patients ( see, i.e., the KCE report 190 on the health care organisation for chronic patients in Belgium, the KCE report 199 on the evaluation of the rehabilitation conventions, the KCE reports 57 (physiotherapy and physical and rehabilitation medicine), 87 (locomotor and neurological rehabilitation) and 140 (cardiac rehabilitation), the recommendations of the Observatory of Chronic Diseases and the reports of the High Superior Council). Besides, guidelines have been issued for some of the precited health problems, especially to support the GP, such as the management of depression or chronic pain. Recommendations:LONG COVID WILL BE AMONG US FOR QUITE SOME TIME We can conclude that despite the recent nature of the condition and the many unanswered questions, it is time to undertake action on several domains. We do not know yet how long the persistent symptoms will last among long COVID patients. Yet, it is clear that â€˜long COVIDâ€™ will be among us for quite some time, also when the acute consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are under control. This will concern patients who have been hospitalised and patients who had a milder form of acute COVID-19. Specific attention will be needed for those who were not tested during the first waves of the pandemic and still have persistent symptoms. EVIDENCE ABOUT ADEQUATE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT PRACTICES ARE ABSENT To answer the question about â€˜what services are neededâ€™ and â€˜how to organise careâ€™ we first need evidence about the (cost-)effectiveness of interventions. Given that long COVID is a new condition that is still poorly understood, the evidence about how to manage care is currently very sparse. Therefore, public agencies around the world started initiatives that aim to generate this evidence. Also KCE launched a call for research on effectiveness of interventions. It will take some time before the evidence becomes available. In the meantime actions will be mainly expert opinion driven. Therefore, it is important that policy measures are temporary and canbe reversed or fine-tuned based on scientific evaluations. A CLEAR NEED FOR MORE AWARENESS We see a need to create awareness about long COVID both in the general public and in health professionals. It is clear that long COVID involves several subcategories of patients requiring differential diagnosis. In the absence of evidence on the effectiveness of long COVID management and treatment strategies, the medical community will have to develop consensus-based guidelines. INTEGRATED INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH The clinical manifestation of long COVID (e.g. wide variety of symptoms affecting several organ systems and also including an important mental health component) pleas for an integrated interdisciplinary approach for at least part of the patients. Although there are several possibilities within the currently reimbursed services, a missing link in our system for long COVID patients seems to be a one-stop interdisciplinary holistic assessment (involving e.g. medical specialists like pulmonologists, cardiologists, general internal medicine, physical medicine, psychologists, physiotherapists, social care, GPs) allowing fast diagnosis (e.g. exclusion of alternative diagnosis or deterioration of underlying comorbidities), functional assessment and fast referral to a patient tailored care pathway. This will probably be situated in the context of primary care for most (e.g. physiotherapy, consultations with psychologists, follow-up by GP) but might require more intensive follow-up (e.g. in a rehabilitation in a hospital setting) for others.

"Levels and Predictors of Anxiety and Depression in Turkish Pregnant Woman During the Covid-19 Pandemic","Ã¢â‚¬Æ’In addition to being a medical phenomenon, pandemics affect the individual and society on several levels and lead to disruptions. In the pandemic process, different groups in the population, including pregnant women as a defenseless group, are subjected to psychological threat. The present study aimed to determine the levels of anxiety and depression and related factors in pregnant women during the the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’The present cross-sectional study was conducted with 269 pregnant women through face-to-face interviews held in Istanbul, Turkey. Regarding the data collection tools, the Cronbach ÃŽÂ± reliability coefficient was of 0.90 for the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and of 0.85 for the Beck Depression Inventory. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’Among the participating pregnant women, 30.5% had mild, 17.5% had moderate, and 5.9% had severe anxiety symptoms, whereas 35.3% had mild, 16.7% had moderate, and 2.2% had severe depression symptoms. We found that those who were concerned about their health had 5.36 times (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.04) more risk of developing anxiety, and 4.82 times (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.01) more risk of developing depression than those who were not concerned. Those who had a history of psychiatric disease had 3.92 times (<i>p</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.02) more risk of developing anxiety than those without it. Ã¢â‚¬Æ’We determined that about half of the pregnant women included in the study had some degree of anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. The risk factors for anxiety and depression among the pregnant women were determined as smoking, concerns about health and getting infected with the coronavirus, history of psychiatric disease, and undergoing regular antenatal care.

"Study protocol for the Respond to Prevent Study: a multi-state randomized controlled trial to improve provision of naloxone, buprenorphine and nonprescription syringes in community pharmacies","Access to the opioid antidote naloxone is a critical component of addressing the opioid crisis. Naloxone is a population-level prevention intervention associated with substantial reductions in overdose mortality and reduction of nonfatal overdose. Pharmacies' pivotal role in dispensing medications like buprenorphine for the treatment of opioid use disorder and selling nonprescription syringes places them at the crossroads of opioid access and risk mitigation methods like naloxone provision. Testing ways to optimize pharmacy-based naloxone provision will be key as the country expands the implementation of naloxone through the medical system. In the Respond to Prevent Study, we conducted a large, practical study of a pharmacy-focused intervention in a sample of Washington, Oregon, Massachusetts and New Hampshire community chain pharmacies to increase naloxone dispensing and improve opioid safety. The intervention integrated two evidence-based educational toolkits and streamlined materials to enhance the focus on naloxone policy, stigma reduction, and patient communications around naloxone, nonprescription syringes and buprenorphine access. The real-world study implemented a stepped wedge, clustered randomized trial design across 175 community chain pharmacies to evaluate the effectiveness of the Respond to Prevent intervention in increasing: (a) pharmacy based naloxone distribution rates, naloxone-related patient engagement, and pharmacist and technicians' attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy toward naloxone; and (b) pharmacy nonprescription syringe sales, and pharmacist and technicians' attitudes, knowledge, perceived behavioral control and self-efficacy toward dispensing buprenorphine for opioid use disorder (secondary outcomes).

"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction for Nurses: An Integrative Review","<b>Introduction:</b> The impact of occupational stress on the mental health and well-being of nurses is a growing concern, magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such compromised health is considered an occupational and patient safety risk. Our aim is to critically examine, analyze, and synthesize the evidence regarding MBSR on the perceived stress levels of nurses including overall mental health and well-being. <b>Methods:</b> An integrative review was conducted. Databases included were PubMed, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library. Inclusion criteria were English only, MBSR, and practicing nurses. <b>Results:</b> We identified 833 articles during database searching. After removal of duplicates and two rounds of screening, 15 articles were included in the final analysis. Several themes were derived with 60% of the studies showing a significant effect of MBSR on decreasing stress. Other significant themes were the decrease in burnout and increase in mindfulness. <b>Conclusions:</b> MBSR may be an effective holistic method of improving mental health for nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both the abbreviated and full, 8-week versions of MBSR, the findings indicate the intervention can reduce depression, anxiety, and stress. Future recommendations include larger sample sizes and measurements other than self-reports to promote generalizability.","Wexler, Schellinger","https://doi.org/10.1177/08980101221079472","20220225","anxiety; depression; mindfulness; nurses; psychological; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27569,""
"Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots in Psychiatry","The utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in psychiatry has risen over the past several years to meet the growing need for improved access to mental health solutions. Additionally, shortages of mental health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to exacerbate the burden of mental illness worldwide. AI applications already in existence include those enabled to assist with psychiatric diagnoses, symptom tracking, disease course prediction, and psychoeducation. Modalities of AI mental health care delivery include availability through the internet, smartphone applications, and digital gaming. Here we review emerging AI-based interventions in the form of chat and therapy bots, specifically conversational applications that teach the user emotional coping mechanisms and provide support for people with communication difficulties, computer generated images of faces that form the basis of avatar therapy, and intelligent animal-like robots with new advances in digital psychiatry. We discuss the implications of incorporating AI chatbots into clinical practice and offer perspectives on how these AI-based interventions will further impact the field of psychiatry.","Pham, Nabizadeh, Selek","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09973-8","20220225","Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; Digital psychiatry; Digital therapy; Therapy bots","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27570,""
"Evaluation of an Experimental Web-based Educational Module on Opioid-related Occupational Safety Among Police Officers: Protocol for a Randomized Pragmatic Trial to Minimize Barriers to Overdose Response","As drug-related morbidity and mortality continue to surge, police officers are on the front lines of the North American overdose (OD) crisis. Drug law enforcement shapes health risks among people who use drugs (PWUD), while also impacting the occupational health and wellness of officers. Effective interventions to align law enforcement practices with public health and occupational safety goals remain underresearched. The Opioids and Police Safety Study (OPS) aims to shift police practices relating to PWUD. It adapts and evaluates the relative effectiveness of a curriculum that bundles content on public health promotion with occupational risk reduction (ORR) to supplement a web-based OD response and naloxone training platform (GetNaloxoneNow.org, or GNN). This novel approach has the potential to improve public health and occupational safety practices, including using naloxone to reverse ODs, referring PWUD to treatment and other supportive services, and avoiding syringe confiscation. This longitudinal study uses a randomized pragmatic trial design. A sample of 300 active-duty police officers from select counties in Pennsylvania, Vermont, and New Hampshire with high OD fatality rates will be randomized (n=150 each) to either the experimental arm (GNN + OPS) or the control arm (GNN + COVID-19 ORR). A pre- and posttraining survey will be administered to all 300 officers, after which they will be administered quarterly surveys for 12 months. A subsample of police officers will also be qualitatively followed in a simultaneous embedded mixed-methods approach. Research ethics approval was obtained from the New York University Institutional Review Board. Results will provide an understanding of the experiences, knowledge, and perceptions of this sample of law enforcement personnel. Generalized linear models will be used to analyze differences in key behavioral outcomes between the participants in each of the 2 study arms and across multiple time points (anticipated minimum effect size to be detected, d=0.50). Findings will be disseminated widely, and the training products will be available nationally once the study is completed. The OPS is the first study to longitudinally assess the impact of a web-based opioid-related ORR intervention for law enforcement in the U.S. Our randomized pragmatic clinical trial aims to remove barriers to life-saving police engagement with PWUD/people who inject drugs by focusing both on the safety of law enforcement and evidence-based and best practices for working with persons at risk of an opioid OD. Our simultaneous embedded mixed-methods approach will provide empirical evaluation of the diffusion of the naloxone-based response among law enforcement.

"Acceptance and Adherence to COVID-19 Preventive Measures are Shaped Predominantly by Conspiracy Beliefs, Mistrust in Science and Fear - A Comparison of More than 20 Psychological Variables","The global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic sparked a great interest in psychological factors that determine or explain peoples' responses to the novel threatening situation and the preventive measures (e.g. wearing masks, social distancing). In this study, we focused on contaminated mindware (conspiracy and paranormal beliefs) and investigated its relationship with both acceptance of and adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures, along with other variables from the domains of emotion (trait anxiety, fear), traditional personality traits (Big 5, locus of control, optimism/pessimism) and motivation (self-control, dispositional regulatory focus). A total of 22 variables were measured in an online survey (<i>N</i> = 374) that took place during the second wave of COVID-19 (Nov. 2020 - March 2021) in Switzerland. Of all variables, the endorsement of specific COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs was most strongly associated with lower acceptance and adherence to the preventive measures, together with mistrust in science and a more right-wing political orientation. In contrast, fear of COVID-19 and prevention regulatory focus were positively associated with acceptance and adherence. Our results therefore highlight the importance of fighting (conspiratorial) misinformation and of increasing the perceived credibility of science in reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Moreover, when acceptance was used as predictor for adherence, agreeableness and dispositional prevention regulatory focus still explained unique variance in adherence, suggesting that such personality and motivational variables play an important role in adhering and regulating preventive behaviour independent from the attitude towards the preventive measures themselves.","Hartmann, MÃƒÂ¼ller","https://doi.org/10.1177/00332941211073656","20220225","Big 5; COVID-19; acceptance; adherence; anxiety; compliance; conspiracy beliefs; fear; locus of control; optimism; paranormal beliefs; pessimism; preventive measures; regulatory focus; science scepticism; self-control","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27572,""

We used a qualitative, single case study design involving semi-structured interviews with call staff and agency leaders (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 9) and analysis of one year of thematic notes from the calls. We found that the calls resulted in multidirectional communication between agency staff and aides, an increased sense of empathy among staff, and a greater integration of aides into the agency's overall infrastructure. We explore how these calls might contribute to aide retention, worker voice, and mental health. We note the facilitators and barriers to implementing this type of job-based support to help other agencies that may be considering similar models.","Tsui, LaMonica, Hyder, Baron","https://doi.org/10.1080/01621424.2022.2035295","20220225","Caregiving: Work Issues; Community and Home Care; Health Promotion: Stress Reduction; Long-Term Care: Staff Roles/Turnover/Staffing Patterns","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27573,""
"Evaluating an online self-help intervention for parents of children with food allergies","Parents of children with food allergies (CwFA) experience reduced quality of life (QoL) and may have reduced access to in-person interventions in the COVID-19 pandemic. This trial developed and evaluated an online, self-help, information provision website, aimed at improving QoL in parents of CwFA. In a single-blinded, randomised controlled trial (RCT), participants were randomised to either receive access to the website or a waiting-list control. At baseline, post-intervention (week 4) and follow-up (week 8), measures of parental food allergy-related QoL, depression, anxiety, stress, intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and self-efficacy were obtained. A total of 205 participants were randomised; 97% were females, 91% white and 78% educated Ã¢â€°Â¥ degree level, with a mean age of 38.95Ã‚Â years (SDÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 6.89). 44.9% (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 92) were retained at follow-up. The arms did not significantly differ on any outcome at any time point. For a sub-group of participants above the clinical cut-off for depression at baseline, the intervention may have improved QoL. Participants reported the website content as useful and accessible, but accessed it infrequently. In baseline data, IU and self-efficacy were significantly associated with QoL. While the COVID-19 pandemic has encouraged greater provision of online interventions, our RCT suggests this particular website is not suitable for this population in general, although future research could examine its efficacy for depressed parents of CwFA, to increase confidence that the sub-group finding was not a Type 1 error. The baseline data suggest IU and self-efficacy remain potential proximal targets for intervention.","Sugunasingha, Jones, du Toit, Jones","https://doi.org/10.1111/pai.13731","20220225","food allergy; intervention; online; parents; quality of life; self-help; website","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27574,""
"Post-traumatic Growth and Resilience among American Medical Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant psychological impact on medical professionals, including medical students, many who have been caring for patients on the frontlines. Understanding how medical students perceive their stressful life experiences is important as the mental health of these future physicians directly impacts their ability to care for patients. We assessed for post-traumatic growth and resilience in the face of traumatic events among a cohort of medical students that attended a medical school located in an early epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between October 29, 2020 and December 1, 2020, medical students at the Icahn School ofÃ‚Â Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York CityÃ‚Â were surveyed on various stressful life events, including COVID-19. We identified specific resilience behaviors, including establishing a supportive social network, relying on a moral compass, and using cognitive flexibility, that medical students commonly used to cope with traumatic experiences. Compared with students who perceived COVID-19 as their most stressful life event, students who perceived other events, such as family issues or serious illness, as most stressful experienced less COVID-related stress (t = -2.2, p = .03), greater posttraumatic growth (t = 4.3, p &lt; .001), and demonstrated more resilient behaviors including establishing and nurturing a supportive social network (t = 2.2, p = .03), developing brain fitness (t = 2.2, p = .03), and finding meaning and purpose in things (t = 2.9, p = .006). This suggests that stressful experiences prior to or in parallel with COVID-19 encouraged posttraumatic growth and development of resilience behaviors that were protective to COVID-19-related stress.","Luo, Santos-Malave, Taku, Katz, Yanagisawa","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11126-022-09981-8","20220225","COVID-19; Medical professionals; Posttraumatic growth; Resilience","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27575,""

"Zinc Intakes and Health Outcomes: An Umbrella Review","It is widely accepted that the zinc element is crucial in human beings. Zinc has gained more attention during the COVID-19 pandemic due to its utilization for the treatment and prevention of respiratory tract infections. However, some studies also pointed out that zinc intake might cause unwanted side effects and even be dangerous when overdosed. To reveal the relationship between zinc intake and health outcomes, we performed an umbrella review from human studies. In total, the umbrella review included 43 articles and identified 11 outcomes for dietary zinc intake and 86 outcomes for supplementary zinc intake. Dietary zinc intake in the highest dose would decrease the risk of overall and specific digestive tract cancers, depression, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in adults. Supplementary zinc consumption in adults was linked to an improvement of depression, antioxidant capacity and sperm quality, higher serum zinc concentration, and lower concentration of inflammatory markers. Zinc supplementation in children would reduce the incidence of diarrhea and pneumonia, improve zinc deficiency and boost growth. However, zinc might not decrease all-cause mortality in adults or the in-hospital mortality of COVID-19. And better maternal and neonatal outcomes may not derive from pregnant women who consumed higher or lower doses of zinc supplementation (&gt;20 mg/day and &lt;20 mg/day, respectively). Dose-response analyses revealed that a daily 5 mg increment of zinc would lower the risk of colorectal and esophageal cancer, whereas a large dose of zinc supplementation (daily 100 mg) showed no benefit in reducing prostate cancer risk.","Li, Cao, Huang, Chen, Chen, Wang, Dong, Wei, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2022.798078","20220225","dietary zinc; meta-analysis; supplementary zinc; supplementation; umbrella review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27577,""

Students' ambiguity regarding academic accomplishment, imminent careers, changes in social life, and other concerns all these factors played a role in amplifying their stress levels, anxiety, and depression worldwide. This study investigates university students' self-esteem and depressions after they have been online learning for over 1 year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. For this research, an adapted questionnaire of Rosenberg (Self-Esteem Scale) and Zung (Self-Rating Depression Scale) was used to get the responses of the participants of public and private universities in Saudi Arabia during March-April 2021. We received a total of 151 valid responses from respondents. For data analysis, we used descriptive statistics, ANOVA, multiple regression and binary logistic regression. The results showed that 75% of the students experienced different levels of depressions, with half (37.5%) having moderate to extreme levels of depression. A total of 41% of students experienced low self-esteem (38% females and 45% males). The regression results indicated depressive symptoms for low self-esteem. Furthermore, results of logistic regression showed that high self-esteem reduces the chances of getting depressive symptoms by 17%. The depressive symptoms were higher in female students than their male counterparts; furthermore, males experienced depressive symptoms less than females by 38%. Based on the current research results, it is concluded that the presence of the COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically increased the depressive symptoms in students, especially in female students. The findings suggested instant consideration and support for students. It is also suggested to the quest for potential managing policies that have been known and effective during the pandemic. Moreover, training should be provided for students to shift their educational experience mindset to an adaptive mindset, which can help them adapt to the new ways of learning and education.","Azmi, Khan, Azmi, Yaswi, Jakovljevic","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.836688","20220225","COVID-19; Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale; Saudi Arabia; Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale; depression; economic crisis; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27578,""
"The Relationship Between Attentional Bias, Anxiety Sensitivity, and Depression and Anxiety Symptoms: Evidence From the COVID-19 Pandemic in China","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to observed increases in reported mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety symptoms. There is evidence attentional bias is associated with depression and anxiety, and it has been further suggested that anxiety sensitivity has a role in both the development and maintenance of depression and anxiety symptoms. Understanding these relationships may help inform preventative interventions for those at risk of mental health concerns. The present study explores the role of anxiety sensitivity, specifically physical and cognitive concerns, as a potential mediator of the relationship between attentional bias with depression and anxiety symptoms. Participants (<i>n</i> = 460) were recruited from the general population in China, and completed an online survey between February and March, 2020 which included the Attention to Positive and Negative Information Scale (APNI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3) and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21). After exploring the correlations between the measures, mediation analysis was performed to explore the role of anxiety sensitivity (physical and cognitive subscales) in the relationship between attentional bias and depression and anxiety (as measured by the DASS-21). The results indicated that negative attention bias was significantly positively correlated with physical and cognitive concerns, physical and cognitive concerns were significantly positively correlated with depression and anxiety, and negative attention bias was significantly positively correlated with depression and anxiety (all <i>ps</i> &lt; 0.001). Physical and cognitive anxiety sensitivity mediated the relationship between negative attention bias and both anxiety and depression symptoms. Negative bias was associated with levels of anxiety and depression, and physical and cognitive anxiety sensitivity mediated associations between negative bias and anxiety and depression symptoms. The study provides theoretical support for intervention and guidance on individual mental health during the pandemic, and helps individuals increase their concern to negative emotions.","Li, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.832819","20220225","anxiety sensitivity; attention bias; cognitive concerns; mental health; physical concerns","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27579,""
"Considerations for Meeting Students' Mental Health Needs at a US University During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Qualitative Study","To better understand the potential ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on U.S. university students' mental health and to generate hypotheses as to how universities may best meet students' mental health needs. Students at a large public university in the United States. Students were invited <i>via</i> email to participate in either interviews or focus groups regarding their COVID-19 pandemic experiences, including mental health impacts. Recruitment took place in two waves. Sessions were led by student members of the research team and took place <i>via</i> video conference between December 2020 and June 2021. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed <i>via</i> Zoom and manually edited and de-identified by the research team. Interview data were analyzed deductively and inductively using a modified grounded theory approach. A total of 40 undergraduate and graduate students took part in the study. Major themes included: (1) Overall impact of the pandemic on mental health; (2) Sources of pandemic stress/mental health impacts; (3) Subsequent coping strategies; and (4) Suggestions for improving university support for student mental health. Subthemes were identified within each major theme. Students reported substantial anxiety and other mental health impacts and felt improvements in communication and access to mental health resources could better support students. This study provides context for the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may be continuing to impact mental health in a north-American university setting and identifies suggestions for potential interventions that future studies may test for effectiveness.","Kaur, Chow, Ravenhurst, Snyder, Pennell, Lover, Goff","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.815031","20220225","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative; recommendations; university students","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27580,""
"Coping with Stress During the Second Wave of the COVID-19 Pandemic by Polish University Students: Strategies, Structure, and Relation to Psychological Well-Being","The aim of the study was to establish a hierarchy of strategies and the structure of copIng with the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic by university students and the relationship between coping strategies and psychological well-being. An exploratory study was conducted using a cross-sectional research design. The study involved 1330 university students, aged 18 to 30 years. The Brief COPE Scale, being the Polish adaptation by JuczyÃ…â€žski and OgiÃ…â€žska-Bulik, and the short version of the Psychological General Well-Being Index (authors' adaptation) were used. Acceptance, doing something else, active coping, and physical activity were the most commonly used strategies for coping with stress during the second wave of the pandemic. Substance use, denial, and behavioral disengagement were lowest in the hierarchy of coping strategies. Female and master's students used a variety of strategies more than male and bachelor's students. Coping strategies correlated significantly with psychological well-being. Four second-degree factors were distinguished, explaining 55.1% of the total variation: maladaptive coping, coping by support, by positive reappraisal, and by action. Stepwise regression analysis confirmed the importance of the second-degree factors as predictors of psychological well-being. Our findings show that young adults studying at the university of physical Education in Poland used adaptive strategies to cope with stress during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gender differences in coping with pandemic stress are similar to those found in previous studies. The structure of coping with pandemic stress is to some extent similar, but also partially dependent on various cultural factors.","Guszkowska, DÃ„â€¦browska-Zimakowska","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S345648","20220225","coping; coronavirus; mental health; pandemic stress; undergraduates","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27581,""
"Self-Efficacy, Internet Self-Efficacy, and Proxy Efficacy as Predictors of the Use of Digital Social and Health Care Services Among Mental Health Service Users in Finland: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digitalization of services, but at the same time, some user groups are excluded due to a lack of digital skills. One of the vulnerable groups is people with mental health problems. It has previously been found that self-efficacy beliefs explain the use of digital technology, but the role of social support is largely unexamined. Bandura's concept of proxy agency provides a useful concept to investigate the role of social support in using digital services. The study investigates sources of social support and the effect of proxy agency, Internet efficacy, and self-efficacy beliefs on the intention to use digital health and social care services. Participants (N = 121) were users in community-based mental health services who were recruited through four organizations in southern Finland for a cross-sectional study. The scales for proxy agency and intention to use services were developed for purpose of the study. The questionnaire also comprised self-efficacy and Internet efficacy scales. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis. Both Internet self-efficacy and proxy efficacy (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) predicted the intention to use digital health and social care services. Self-efficacy had an indirect positive effect on intention through Internet self-efficacy. Family members and friends were the main source of social support in using digital services. Internet self-efficacy and proxy efficacy are important contributors to the intention to use digital health and social care services. Proxy agents may serve as facilitators to reduce the digital divide and promote the use of digital services by complementing individuals' self-efficacy and Internet self-efficacy beliefs. It is important to develop different forms of social support, such as peer support, to enhance the quality of proxy agency. The limitations of proxy agency are discussed.","Tetri, JuujÃƒÂ¤rvi","https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S340867","20220225","Internet self-efficacy; digital services; mental health service users; proxy efficacy; self-efficacy; social support","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27582,""
"Classification of endogenous and exogenous bursts in collective emotions based on Weibo comments during COVID-19","Bursts and collective emotion have been widely studied in social physics field where researchers use mathematical models to understand human social dynamics. However, few researches recognize and separately analyze the internal and external influence on burst behaviors. To bridge this gap, we introduce a non-parametric approach to classify an interevent time series into five scenarios: random arrival, endogenous burst, endogenous non-burst, exogenous burst and exogenous non-burst. In order to process large-scale social media data, we first segment the interevent time series into sections by detecting change points. Then we use the rule-based algorithm to classify the time series based on its distribution. To validate our model, we analyze 27.2 million COVID-19 related comments collected from Chinese social media between January to October 2020. We adopt the emotion category called Profile of Mood States which consists of six emotions: Anger, Depression, Fatigue, Vigor, Tension and Confusion. This enables us to compare the burst features of different collective emotions during the COVID-19 period. The burst detection and classification approach introduced in this paper can also be applied to analyzing other complex systems, including but not limited to social media, financial market and signal processing.","Wu, Sano, Takayasu, Takayasu","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-07067-w","20220225","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27583,""
"Need for support among healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic: a qualitative study at an academic hospital in the Netherlands","The aim of the current study is to gain insight into the factors that benefit vitality and resilience of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, to develop and direct specific support strategies. This study applies a qualitative design, consisting of six focus groups and five interviews among 38 frontline healthcare workers in a large Dutch academic hospital. Included were professionals of the intensive care unit, COVID-19 departments, infection prevention units and facility management services. The study was conducted in October and November 2020, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis was applied to focus group and interview data to gain insight into the factors that contribute to maintaining vitality and resilience, and to assess specific support needs. Data analysis of the focus groups and individual interviews resulted in a thematic map of the factors that contribute to maintaining resilience and vitality. The map stretches over two axes: one ranging from a healthy basis to adequate professional functioning and the other from individual to organisation, resulting in four quadrants: recharge and recover (healthy basis, individual), safety and connectedness at work (healthy basis, organisational), collaboration (professional functioning, organisational) and professional identity (professional functioning, individual). Areas for organisational support strategies to increase vitality and resilience among healthcare professionals are: consistent communication, realistic job performance expectations, monitor and improve mental resilience, showing appreciation and act upon practical support requests.","Kranenburg, de Veer, Oude Hengel, Kouwenhoven-Pasmooij, de Pagter, Hoogendijk, Busschbach, van Mol","https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059124","20220225","COVID-19; mental health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27584,""

"Understanding post-conflict mental health needs and co-producing a community-based mental health intervention for older adults in Colombia: a research protocol","Older adults in Colombia have seen a number of stressful life events - including the Colombian armed conflict, forced misplacement and recently COVID-19. These events likely have had and are having a substantial impact on people's mental health and well-being, whilst mental health care provision in Colombia is not sufficient and often access is limited and unaffordable. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the impact of stressful life events on the mental health of older adults living in Colombia, and co-produce, pilot, and evaluate a community-based mental health intervention in Turbo. This 3-year international mixed-methods study comprises of three phases: Phase I will explore the impact of stressful life events on the mental health of older adults living in Colombia, and their mental health needs, via quantitative needs assessments and qualitative interviews and focus groups; Phase II will involve synthesising the findings from Phase I as well as conducting a systematic review and qualitative interviews with experts into implementing mental health interventions in LMICs to co-produce a community-based mental health intervention with older adults and local community group leaders and care providers; Phase III will involve the piloting and evaluation of the mental health intervention via quantitative and qualitative assessments. Co-production and public involvement underpin each element of this project. Appropriate mental health care is as important as physical health care, but this study also looks at how we might integrate these findings into community-level public health initiatives for application both within Colombia and more widely in both LMICs and more developed countries. This study protocol will act as a guide for the development and adaptation of psychosocial mental health interventions in different cultures and contexts.","Giebel, Zuluaga, Saldarriaga, White, Reilly, Montoya, Allen, Liu, CastaÃƒÂ±o-Pineda, Gabbay","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-07645-8","20220225","Ageing; Low- and middle-income countries; Mental health; Post-conflict; Violence","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27586,""
"Psychological distress and associated factors among kidney transplant recipients and living kidney donors during COVID-19","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused significant psychological distress globally. Our study assessed the prevalence of psychological distress and associated factors during COVID-19 pandemic among kidney transplant recipients and kidney donors. A cross-sectional survey of 497 participants (325 recipients and 172 donors) was conducted from 1st May to 30th June 2020 in Singapore. The survey questionnaire assessed knowledge levels of COVID-19, socio-demographic data, health status, psychosocial impact of COVID-19, and precautionary behaviors during the pandemic. Psychological distress was defined as having anxiety, depression, or stress measured by the validated Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. Linear regression analyses were used to assess factors associated with higher psychological distress. The prevalence of psychological distress was 14.3% (95% confidence interval: 11.5-17.6%) in the overall population; it was 12.8% (9.79-16.6%) in recipients and 13.4% (9.08-19.6%) in donors with no significant difference (PÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.67). Younger age (21-49 vs. Ã¢â€°Â¥50Ã¢â‚¬â€°years), unmarried status, non-Singapore citizen, worse health conditions, and worrying about physical and mental health were associated with higher psychological distress. Malays (versus Chinese), taking precautionary measures (hand sanitization), and receiving enough information about COVID-19 were associated with lower psychological distress. No interactions were observed between recipients and donors. At least one in ten recipients and donors suffer from psychological distress during COVID-19 pandemic. Focused health education to younger adults, unmarried individuals, non-Singapore citizens, and those with poor health status could potentially prevent psychological distress in recipients and donors.","Thangaraju, Wang, Kee, Tee, Lu, Yong, Ho, Liew, Foo, Kwan, Ng, He, Lee, Baey, Leong, Tan, Shirore, Jafar","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-022-02698-7","20220225","Anxiety; COVID-19; Depression; Kidney transplant; Psychological distress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27587,""
"The medium-term consequences of COVID-19 lockdown on lifestyle among Spanish older people with hypertension, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal-diseases, depression, and cancer","To assess the influence of different chronic diseases on lifestyle and health behaviours changes after COVID-19 lockdown in Spanish older people compared to people without these diseases and compare the differences in these changes between both periods. 1092 participants (80.3Ã‚Â±5.6y;66.5%women) from two Spanish cohorts were included. Telephone-based questionaries were used to evaluate health risk behaviours and lifestyle during lockdown and 7-months later. Self-reported physician-based diagnosis of chronic diseases was also reported. Cox-proportional models adjusted for main confounders were applied. Improvements concerning lifestyle were found in older people with chronic diseases, although they worsened the physical component (except cancer). When they were compared to those without these diseases, hypertension was associated with a lower frequency of increased alcohol consumption (Hazard ratio:0.73[95% confidence interval:0.55;0.99]). Pulmonary diseases were associated with a lower risk of both decreased sedentary time (0.58[0.39;0.86]) and worsening sleep quality (0.56[0.36;0.87]), while CVD was only associated with a lower frequency of decreased sedentary time (0.58[0.38;0.88]). Depression was linked to a higher risk of increasing diet quality (1.53[1.00;2.36]). Cancer was less likely to worsen sleep quality (0.44[0.22;0.89]), but more likely to worsen their social contact frequency (2.05[1.05;3.99]). No significant association related to musculoskeletal diseases. Beneficial changes in health risk behaviours and lifestyle after the COVID-19 lockdown in older people with chronic diseases were found. Particularly, older people with hypertension, pulmonary disease and cancer showed beneficial changes after lockdown compared to their counterparts without diseases.

"Bacterial Biofilm Formation on Nano-Copper Added PLA Suited for 3D Printed Face Masks","The COVID-19 Pandemic leads to an increased worldwide demand for personal protection equipment in the medical field, such as face masks. New approaches to satisfy this demand have been developed, and one example is the use of 3D printing face masks. The reusable 3D printed mask may also have a positive effect on the environment due to decreased littering. However, the microbial load on the 3D printed objects is often disregarded. Here we analyze the biofilm formation of <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, <i>Staphylococcus aureus,</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i> on suspected antimicrobial PlactiveÃ¢â€žÂ¢ PLA 3D printing filaments and non-antimicrobial GiantarmÃ¢â€žÂ¢ PLA. To characterize the biofilm-forming potential scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Confocal scanning electron microscopy (CLSM) and colony-forming unit assays (CFU) were performed. Attached cells could be observed on all tested 3D printing materials. Gram-negative strains <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and <i>E. coli</i> reveal a strong uniform growth independent of the tested 3D filament (for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> even with stressed induced growth reaction by PlactiveÃ¢â€žÂ¢). Only Gram-positive <i>S. aureus</i> shows strong growth reduction on PlactiveÃ¢â€žÂ¢. These results suggest that the postulated antimicrobial PlactiveÃ¢â€žÂ¢ PLA does not affect Gram-negative bacteria species. These results indicate that reusable masks, while better for our environment, may pose another health risk.","Kiel, Kaltschmidt, Asghari, HÃƒÂ¼tten, Kaltschmidt, Kaltschmidt","https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10020439","20220225","3D printing; E. coli; P. aeruginosa; PLA; S. aureus; antimicrobial; biofilm; face masks; nano-copper; personal protective equipment","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27589,""
"<i>Ofeleein i mi Vlaptin</i>-Volume II: Immunity Following Infection or mRNA Vaccination, Drug Therapies and Non-Pharmacological Management at Post-Two Years SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic","The persistence of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has triggered research into limiting transmission, morbidity and mortality, thus warranting a comprehensive approach to guide balanced healthcare policies with respect to people's physical and mental health. The mainstay priority during COVID-19 is to achieve widespread immunity, which could be established through natural contact or vaccination. Deep knowledge of the immune response combined with recent specific data indicates the potential inferiority of induced immunity against infection. Moreover, the prevention of transmission has been founded on general non-pharmacological measures of protection, albeit debate exists considering their efficacy and, among other issues, their socio-psychological burden. The second line of defense is engaged after infection and is supported by a plethora of studied agents, such as antibiotics, steroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral medications and other biological agents that have been proposed, though variability in terms of benefits and adverse events has not allowed distinct solutions, albeit certain treatments might have a role in prevention and/or treatment of the disease.

"Eudaimonic and Hedonic Psychological Well-Being among Parents of Children with Cancer before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Comparative Cross-Sectional Study","The main aim of this study was to analyze the eudaimonic and hedonic well-being of parents of children with cancer by considering the role of a global stressor-the COVID-19 pandemic. One group of parents was assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the other was assessed before it occurred. It was hypothesized that there may be a cumulative effect of stress, with parents expressing lower well-being during the pandemic due to the accumulation of stress related to their child's illness and the pandemic. In total, 310 parents participated in the study. Following propensity score matching, 111 pairs were established. The results of the comparative analyses did not support the hypothesis, as the groups did not differ significantly in their reported levels of either eudaimonic (F (1.93) = 0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.75, ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>= 0.001) or hedonic well-being (F (1.100) = 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.89, ÃŽÂ·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.0001). These findings showed a limited effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of parents of children with cancer. The oncological disease of a child is likely to be the central and the strongest factor for the parents, meaning that an additional, global stressor does not cause deeper exacerbation of their well-being.","ZiÃƒÂ³Ã…â€škowska, Bargiel-Matusiewicz, GruszczyÃ…â€žska","https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm11041113","20220225","COVID-19 pandemic; mental health; parents of children with cancer; psychological distress; psychological well-being; satisfaction in life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27592,""
"A Preliminary Italian Cross-Sectional Study on the Level of Digital Psychiatry Training, Knowledge, Beliefs and Experiences among Medical Students, Psychiatry Trainees and Professionals","The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of digital psychiatry (DP), resulting in the need for a new skilled healthcare workforce. The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of training, knowledge, beliefs, and experiences of young mental health professionals and medical students in DP. An ad hoc cross-sectional survey was administered and descriptive analyses, Student's <i>t</i> and ANOVA tests were conducted, together with an exploratory factor analysis, bivariate correlations and linear regression. Most of the sample (N = 239) declared that DP was never discussed within their academic training (89.1%), mainly revealing an overall lack of knowledge on the issue. Nevertheless, subjects mostly declared that DP represents a valuable therapeutic tool in mental health (80%) and that their training should include this topic (54.4%). Moreover, most subjects declared that digital interventions are less effective than face-to-face ones (73.2%), despite the emerging evidence that being trained in DP is significantly associated with the belief that digital and in-person interventions are comparable in their effectiveness (<i>p</i> Ã¢â€°Â¤ 0.05). Strong positive correlations were found between the knowledge score (KS) and perceived significance index (PSI) (r = 0.148, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and KS and Digital Psychiatry Opinion (DPO) index (r = 0.193, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). PSI scores statistically significantly predicted KS total scores (F(1, 237) = 5.283, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.022, <i>p</i> = 0.022). KS scores statistically significantly predicted DPO total scores (F(1, 237) = 9.136, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.037, <i>p</i> = 0.003). During the current pandemic, DP represented an ideal response to the forced physical distancing by ensuring the advantage of greater access to care. However, this kind of intervention is still uncommon, and mental health professionals still prove to be skeptical. The lack of formal training on DP during the academic years could be a limiting factor.","Orsolini, Bellagamba, Marchetti, Menculini, Tempia Valenta, Salvi, Volpe","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020390","20220225","digital psychiatry; education; psychiatry training; telepsychiatry; trainees","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27593,""
"Health System Resiliency and the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Case Study of a New Nationwide Contingency Staffing Program","When COVID-19 emerged, the U.S. Veterans Health Administration (VA) was in the process of implementing a national contingency staffing program called Clinical Resource Hubs (CRHs). CRHs were intended to provide regional contingency staffing for primary and mental health clinics experiencing staffing shortages primarily through telehealth. Long-term plans (year 2) included emergency management support. Early in the implementation, we conducted semi-structured interviews with CRH directors and national program leaders (n = 26) and used a rapid analysis approach to identify actions taken by CRHs to support the resiliency of the VA healthcare system during the pandemic. We found that the CRH program was flexible and nimble enough to allow VA to leverage providers at hubs to better respond to the demands of COVID-19. Actions taken at hubs to sustain patient access and staff resiliency during the pandemic included supporting call centers and training VA providers on virtual care delivery. Factors that facilitated CRH's emergency response included hub staff expertise in telehealth and the increased acceptability of virtual care among key stakeholders. We conclude that hub providers serving as contingency staff, as well as specialization in delivering virtual outpatient and inpatient care, enabled VA health system resiliency and recovery during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Cannedy, Bergman, Medich, Rose, Stockdale","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020244","20220225","COVID-19; health systems; resilience; telehealth; workforce wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27594,""
"Self-Assessment of Health Status and Willingness to Be Vaccinated in Adolescents from the Niigata Prefecture and the Khabarovsk Region during COVID-19","This study examined the self-assessment of Niigata's and Khabarovsk's adolescents' health status and their willingness to be vaccinated during the COVID-19 pandemic. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to 735 boys and girls (aged 15 years) from Niigata, Japan (<i>n</i> = 387), and Khabarovsk, Russia (<i>n</i> = 394), between May and July 2021. Specifically, this questionnaire focused on COVID-19, including a self-assessment of health status, adaptation to a new lifestyle, and impressions about the COVID-19 vaccination. The self-assessment was based on a 4-point scale: ""Got very bad""; ""Got a little bit bad""; ""Did not change""; ""Got better/I don't know"". Additionally, binomial logistic regression was conducted to determine the association between the self-assessment of health status and the factors exacerbating their responses. Based on the findings, 25.7 and 29.9% of Niigata and Khabarovsk's adolescents, respectively, selected ""Got very bad"" and ""Got a little bit bad"" for their self-assessments, while the binomial logistic regression showed that the difficulty of adapting to a new lifestyle was a factor worsening the boys' subjective health. However, the items could not explain the deterioration of their subjective health in girls. Moreover, 76.9% of Niigata's adolescents were positive about the COVID-19 vaccination, compared to 35.5% of the adolescents in Khabarovsk.","Inaba, Rziankina, Hoshino, Takano, Potapova, Zhmerenetsky, Ishigami","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare10020184","20220225","COVID-19; adolescent; mental health; new lifestyle; vaccinate","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27595,""
"Correlation between Positive Orientation and Control of Anger, Anxiety and Depression in Nursing Students in Poland, Spain and Slovakia during the COVID-19 Pandemic","(1) This study analysed the relationship between positive orientation and subjective control of anger, anxiety and depression in nursing students in Poland, Spain and Slovakia during the pandemic. (2) The survey was carried out by the diagnostic survey method in a group of 756 nursing students in Poland, Spain and Slovakia. The empirical data were gathered using an original survey questionnaire, the Positive Orientation Scale and the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale. (3) It was shown that the positive orientation level in Polish students was significantly lower than in students in Spain (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and Slovakia (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). Low results for positive orientation were obtained in nearly half (47.18%) of the respondents in the Polish sample, whereas it was 34.18% and 31.18% in the Spanish and Slovak samples, respectively (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001). A positive orientation was the most important predictor of emotional control among the nursing students at all the sites (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001).

Therefore, it is important to carefully monitor students' mental health during the pandemic to determine the demand for psychological and emotional support.","Kupcewicz, Mikla, KaduÃ„ÂÃƒÂ¡kovÃƒÂ¡, Grochans, Valcarcel, Cybulska","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042482","20220225","anger; anxiety; depression; nursing student; positive orientation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27596,""
"Mental Health Status before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Patients First Visiting a Psychosomatic Internal Medicine Clinic in Tokyo, Japan","The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has aggravated anxiety and depression worldwide, particularly in patients with chronic illnesses and mental disorders. Using validated questionnaires, in this paper, we examine the psychological effects of the pandemic in Japan in detail. The General Mental Health Scale (GHQ), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) were used to assess mental health, state and trait anxiety, and depression, respectively. The survey was completed during the patients' first visits to the clinic of Psychosomatic Internal Medicine from November 2018 to April 2021. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare data from 226 participants before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The GHQ total, GHQ subscales of ""social dysfunction"" and ""anxiety and dysphoria"", and state anxiety scores were significantly higher during than before the pandemic. The GHQ total, some GHQ subscales, and state anxiety scores were significantly higher among male than female participants during the pandemic. The GHQ total, some GHQ subscales, CES-D, and state anxiety scores in those aged 10-39 years were significantly higher. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic may have caused mental health changes in many individuals based on their gender, age, and with time.","Shaku, Ishiburo, Miwa, Maruoka","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042488","20220225","CES-D; COVID-19; GHQ; STAI; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; psychosomatic","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27597,""
"Mixed-Methods Survey of Healthcare Workers' Experiences of Personal Protective Equipment during the COVID-19 Pandemic in Aotearoa/New Zealand","There have been widespread issues with the supply and distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) globally throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, raising considerable public concern. We aimed to understand the experiences of healthcare workers using PPE during the first COVID-19 surge (February-June 2020) in Aotearoa/New Zealand (NZ). This study consisted of an online, voluntary, and anonymous survey, distributed nationwide via multimodal recruitment. Reported domains included PPE supply, sourcing and procurement, fit-testing and fit-checking, perceived protection, trust and confidence in the workplace, mental health, and the likelihood of remaining in the profession. Differences according to demographic variables (e.g., profession and workplace) were examined. We undertook a descriptive analysis of responses to open-text questions to provide explanation and context to the quantitative data. The survey was completed in October-November 2020 by 1411 healthcare workers. Reported PPE shortages were common (26.8%) among healthcare workers during surge one in NZ. This led to respondents personally saving both new (31.2%) and used (25.2%) PPE, purchasing their own PPE (28.2%), and engaging in extended wear practices. More respondents in the public system reported being told not to wear PPE by their organisation compared with respondents in the private sector. Relatively low numbers of respondents who were required to undertake aerosol-generating procedures reported being fit-tested annually (3.8%), a legal requirement in NZ. Healthcare workers in NZ reported a concerning level of unsafe PPE practices during surge one, as well as a high prevalence of reported mental health concerns. As NZ and other countries transition from COVID-19 elimination to suppression strategies, healthcare worker safety should be paramount, with clear communication regarding PPE use and supply being a key priority.","Wild, Wells, Coetzee, Grant, Sullivan, Derraik, Anderson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042474","20220225","COVID-19; healthcare worker; personal protective equipment (PPE)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27598,""
"Spirituality, Community Belonging, and Mental Health Outcomes of Indigenous Peoples during the COVID-19 Pandemic","We aimed to assess the association between community belonging, spirituality, and mental health outcomes among Indigenous Peoples during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional observational study used online survey distribution and targeted outreach to the local Indigenous community to collect a convenience sample between 23 April 2020 and 20 November 2020. The surveys included demographic information, self-reported symptoms of depression (PHQ-2) and anxiety (GAD-2), and measures of the sense of community belonging and the importance of spirituality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the association between the sense of community belonging and spirituality, and symptoms of anxiety and depression. Of the 263 self-identified Indigenous people who participated, 246 participants had complete outcome data, including 99 (40%) who reported symptoms of depression and 110 (45%) who reported symptoms of anxiety. Compared to Indigenous participants with a strong sense of community belonging, those with weak community belonging had 2.42 (95% CI: 1.12-5.24)-times greater odds of reporting symptoms of anxiety, and 4.40 (95% CI: 1.95-9.89)-times greater odds of reporting symptoms of depression. While spirituality was not associated with anxiety or depression in the adjusted models, 76% of Indigenous participants agreed that spirituality was important to them pre-pandemic, and 56% agreed that it had become more important since the pandemic began. Community belonging was associated with positive mental health outcomes. Indigenous-led cultural programs that foster community belonging may promote the mental health of Indigenous Peoples.","Burnett, Purkey, Davison, Watson, Kehoe, Traviss, Nolan, Bayoumi","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042472","20220225","Indigenous Peoples; culturally competent care; mental health; social support; spirituality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27599,""
"Empathy through the Pandemic: Changes of Different Emphatic Dimensions during the COVID-19 Outbreak","Growing evidence suggests that empathy is a relevant psychological trait to face the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, but at the present very little is known on whether this multi-dimensional construct has been affected by the pandemic outbreak differently in its separate components. Here, we aimed at filling this gap by capitalizing on the opportunity of having collected data from different self-report measures and cognitive tasks assessing the main dimensions of empathy immediately before the beginning of the global pandemic and about one year later. The results showed a detrimental impact of the pandemic outbreak on empathic social skills but not on both cognitive (perspective-taking) and emotional empathy that instead significantly improved. Thus, reduced empathic social skills could be a weakness to be targeted in psychological interventions to help people cope with the mental health challenges related to COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the ability of understanding another's mental states and emotions could represent a strength in dealing with the current long-lasting crisis.","Baiano, Raimo, Zappullo, Marra, Cecere, Trojano, Conson","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042435","20220225","COVID-19; empathy; social cognition; social skills; theory of mind","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27600,""
"The Effect of Surgical Masks on the Featural and Configural Processing of Emotions","From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of surgical masks became widespread. However, they occlude an important part of the face and make it difficult to decode and interpret other people's emotions. To clarify the effect of surgical masks on configural and featural processing, participants completed a facial emotion recognition task to discriminate between happy, sad, angry, and neutral faces. Stimuli included fully visible faces, masked faces, and a cropped photo of the eyes or mouth region. Occlusion due to the surgical mask affects emotion recognition for sadness, anger, and neutral faces, although no significative differences were found in happiness recognition. Our findings suggest that happiness is recognized predominantly via featural processing.","Maiorana, Dini, Poletti, Tagini, Rita Reitano, Pravettoni, Priori, Ferrucci","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042420","20220225","COVID-19; alexithymia; configural processing; emotion recognition; face processing; featural processing; surgical mask","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27601,""
"Did COVID-19-Related Alcohol Sales Restrictions Reduce Alcohol Consumption? Findings from a National Online Survey in South Africa","South Africa has a high prevalence of heavy episodic drinking (HED). Due to the high levels of alcohol misuse and violence, public hospital intensive care units were often overrun during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research investigated alcohol intake behaviour change during differing levels of lockdown restrictions, which included bans on alcohol sales. A self-reported Facebook survey ran from July to November 2020. The questions included socio-demographics, income, alcohol intake, purchasing behaviour, and reasoning. Chi-square tests/Fisher's exact test for categorical data, Student's <i>t</i>-test for normal continuous data, and the Mann-Whitney U test for non-normal data were applied. Multiple logistic regression was run for HED versus moderate drinkers. A total of 798 participants took part in the survey, of which 68.4% were female. Nearly 50% of participants fell into the HED category and the majority bought alcohol illegally during restrictions. HED respondents who drank more alcohol than usual during restrictions reported that they felt stressed, needed to relax, and were bored. Policies intended to increase the pricing of alcohol may have the potential to reduce alcohol intake. Reducing stress and anxiety may be key to curtailing HED during emergency situations.","Theron, Swart, Londani, Parry, Petersen Williams, Harker","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042422","20220225","COVID-19 pandemic; Facebook; anxiety; coping mechanisms; depression and alcohol policies; heavy episodic drinking; illegal alcohol sales; lockdown","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27602,""
"The Role of Virtual Reality as a Psychological Intervention for Mental Health Disturbances during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Narrative Review","The COVID-19 pandemic spread throughout the world and created many problems. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an increase in mortality and morbidity, including mental health problems. Around the world, the movement control order (MCO) was strictly enforced, but the spread of the infection epidemic was still rampant. The magnitude of the increase in mental health illnesses has caused many individuals to suffer. Given that face-to-face interventions are challenging to carry out during an outbreak, we need to address this critical problem through an online approach, such as virtual reality (VR). This approach is vital to helping patients deal with their existing problems in more pragmatic, practical, and customer-friendly ways. Thus, in the present review, we proposed the development of a virtual digital device for this noble purpose. Various challenges, improvements, and expectations for VR applications were outlined and discussed in this narrative review.","Hatta, Sidi, Sharip, Das, Saini","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042390","20220225","COVID-19; digital devices; mental health problems; virtual reality applications","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27603,""

(2) The study was carried out in spring 2021 on a group of 756 nursing students in Poland (<i>n</i> = 390), Spain (<i>n</i> = 196) and Slovakia (<i>n</i> = 170). The diagnostic survey method was applied with the questionnaire technique, and the following standardised research tools were used: Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and the Health Behaviour Inventory (IZZ).

"Functional and Psychological Changes after Exercise Training in Post-COVID-19 Patients Discharged from the Hospital: A PRISMA-Compliant Systematic Review","Millions of people worldwide are infected with COVID-19, and COVID-19 survivors have been found to suffer from functional disabilities and mental disorders such as depression and anxiety. This is a matter of concern because COVID-19 is still not over. Because reinfection is still possible in COVID-19 survivors, decreased physical function and increased stress and anxiety can lower immune function. However, the optimal exercise intensity and volume appear to remain unknown. Therefore, the current systematic review aimed to evaluate the effect of resistance or aerobic exercises in post-COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge. We conducted searches in the Scopus, SciELO, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Google Scholar databases. Studies that met the following criteria were included: (i) English language, (ii) patients with COVID-19 involved with resistance or aerobic exercise programs after hospital discharge. Out of 381 studies reviewed, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. Evidence shows that exercise programs composed of resistance exercise (e.g., 1-2 sets of 8-10 repetitions at 30-80% of 1RM) along with aerobic exercise (e.g., 5 to 30 min at moderate intensity) may improve the functional capacity and quality of life (reduce stress and mental disorders) in post-COVID-19 patients. In addition, only one study reported reinfection of three subjects involved with the exercise program, suggesting that exercise programs may be feasible for the rehabilitation of the patients. A meta-analysis was not conducted because the included studies have methodological heterogeneities, and they did not examine a control group. Consequently, the results should be generalized with caution.","Ahmadi Hekmatikar, Ferreira JÃƒÂºnior, Shahrbanian, Suzuki","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042290","20220225","COVID-19; COVID-19 patients; SARS-CoV-2 virus; coronavirus disease; mental health; psychological changes; rehabilitation; resistance and aerobic exercise","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27605,""

"Burnout and Health Issues among Prehospital Personnel in Taiwan Fire Departments during a Sudden Spike in Community COVID-19 Cases: A Cross-Sectional Study","A spike in COVID-19 cases in Taiwan's communities caused a significant increase in workload and infection concerns among prehospital personnel working in Taiwan fire departments. The present study was aimed at investigating their health status during this period. The target population was prehospital personnel who are from Taiwan fire departments, and who responded to COVID-19 patients during the community outbreak period. A questionnaire was employed to assess their physical and mental health status. The results showed that prehospital personnel suffered from moderate to severe degrees of burnout. Workload, body burden, and perceived pressure increased significantly during this period. Participants received more support from friends, family, and colleagues than they did from authorities. The paramedics reported higher scores for personal burnout than the emergency medical technicians (EMTs). Compared to non-COVID-19 response units, special COVID-19 response units reported higher scores for workload, body burden, and supportive environment. The results suggested that personal and work-related burnout were associated with higher perceived pressure. This study is the first investigation of physical and mental health burdens among prehospital personnel in Taiwan fire departments during the COVID-19 pandemic.

"How Long Does Adaption Last for? An Update on the Psychological Impact of the Confinement in Portugal","During the first COVID-19 related confinement in Portugal, there was a decrease in the levels of psychological symptoms measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale 21 (March to April 2020). Upon experiencing a new period of restraints in 2021, the psychological impact of this sample was assessed again (<i>N</i> = 322, two more time points). It was expected that the psychological symptoms evidenced in February 2021 would be at similar levels to those found in April 2020, leading to a transfer of adaptation. Contrary to our hypothesis, in the second confinement in Portugal there were higher levels of depression and stress symptoms than at the beginning of the pandemic. On the other hand, the maximum level of anxiety was observed in March 2020. It seems that our perception of the threats in 2021 was not the same as at the onset of COVID-19, or that knowledge was not disseminated to the general population to increase their mental health literacy and help them cope with the imposed challenges.","Costa, Fernandes, Ferreira, Couto, Machado-Sousa, Moreira, Morgado, PicÃƒÂ³-PÃƒÂ©rez","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042243","20220225","COVID-19; DASS-21; Portugal; adaptation; confinement; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27608,""
"The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Drug Use Behaviors, Fentanyl Exposure, and Harm Reduction Service Support among People Who Use Drugs in Rural Settings","The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the opioid overdose crisis in the US. Rural communities have been disproportionately affected by opioid use and people who use drugs in these settings may be acutely vulnerable to pandemic-related disruptions due to high rates of poverty, social isolation, and pervasive resource limitations. We performed a mixed-methods study to assess the impact of the pandemic in a convenience sample of people who use drugs in rural Illinois. We conducted 50 surveys capturing demographics, drug availability, drug use, sharing practices, and mental health symptoms. In total, 19 qualitative interviews were performed to further explore COVID-19 knowledge, impact on personal and community life, drug acquisition and use, overdose, and protective substance use adaptations. Drug use increased during the pandemic, including the use of fentanyl products such as gel encapsulated ""beans"" and ""buttons"". Disruptions in supply, including the decreased availability of heroin, increased methamphetamine costs and a concomitant rise in local methamphetamine production, and possible fentanyl contamination of methamphetamine was reported. Participants reported increased drug use alone, experience and/or witness of overdose, depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Consistent access to harm reduction services, including naloxone and fentanyl test strips, was highlighted as a source of hope and community resiliency. The COVID-19 pandemic period was characterized by changing drug availability, increased overdose risk, and other drug-related harms faced by people who use drugs in rural areas. Our findings emphasize the importance of ensuring access to harm reduction services, including overdose prevention and drug checking for this vulnerable population.","Bolinski, Walters, Salisbury-Afshar, Ouellet, Jenkins, Almirol, Van Ham, Fletcher, Johnson, Schneider, Ompad, Pho","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042230","20220225","COVID-19; PWID; fentanyl beans; fentanyl buttons; harm reduction; methamphetamine; rural","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27609,""
"Length of Stay Analysis of COVID-19 Hospitalizations Using a Count Regression Model and Quantile Regression: A Study in Bologna, Italy","This study aimed to identify and explore the hospital admission risk factors associated with the length of stay (LoS) by applying a relatively novel statistical method for count data using predictors among COVID-19 patients in Bologna, Italy. The second goal of this study was to model the LoS of COVID patients to understand which covariates significantly influenced it and identify the potential risk factors associated with LoS in Bolognese hospitals from 1 February 2020 to 10 May 2021. The clinical settings we focused on were the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and ordinary hospitalization, including low-intensity stays. We used Poisson, negative binomial (NB), Hurdle-Poisson, and Hurdle-NB regression models to model the LoS. The fitted models were compared using the Akaike information criterion (AIC), Vuong's test criteria, and Rootograms. We also used quantile regression to model the effects of covariates on the quantile values of the response variable (LoS) using a Poisson distribution, and to explore a range of conditional quantile functions, thereby exposing various forms of conditional heterogeneity and controlling for unobserved individual characteristics. Based on the chosen performance criteria, Hurdle-NB provided the best fit. As an output from the model, we found significant changes in average LoS for each predictor. Compared with ordinary hospitalization and low-intensity stays, the ICU setting increased the average LoS by 1.84-fold. Being hospitalized in long-term hospitals was another contributing factor for LoS, increasing the average LoS by 1.58 compared with regular hospitals. When compared with the age group [50, 60) chosen as the reference, the average LoS decreased in the age groups [0, 10), [30, 40), and [40, 50), and increased in the oldest age group [80, 102). Compared with the second wave, which was chosen as the reference, the third wave did not significantly affect the average LoS, whereas it increased by 1.11-fold during the first wave and decreased by 0.77-fold during out-wave periods. The results of the quantile regression showed that covariates related to the ICU setting, hospitals with longer hospitalization, the first wave, and the out-waves were statistically significant for all the modeled quantiles. The results obtained from our study can help us to focus on the risk factors that lead to an increased LoS among COVID-19 patients and benchmark different models that can be adopted for these analyses.","Zeleke, Moscato, Miglio, Chiari","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042224","20220225","AIC; COVID-19; Hurdle model; Rootograms; Vuong test; count data model; generalized linear model; length of stay; quantile regression","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27610,""
"Prevalence and Risk Factors Associated with Postpartum Depression during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Literature Review and Meta-Analysis","Owing to the high prevalence and detrimental consequences, postpartum depression (PPD) has been identified as one of the severe global public health issues in the last decade. Prior research found that during disasters or events, the prevalence rates of mental disorders among postpartum women are significantly high. However, the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on PPD and its risk factors remained unclear for postpartum women. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence of PPD and to summarize risk factors for PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Three electronic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane library databases were systematically searched for articles from their commencements until 1 November 2021. Quality assessment of included studies, random-effects meta-analysis, and sensitivity analysis were performed. A total of eight studies with 6480 postpartum women during the COVID-19 pandemic were included, and most studies were conducted in developed countries. The pooled prevalence of PPD was 34% (95% CI: 21-46%) during the COVID-19 pandemic, much higher than the incident of previous research during the non-pandemic period. Risk factors for PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic were defined as socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, stress and anxiety, lack of various supports, and the COVID-19 related factors. The research findings indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic could make detrimental effects on maternal mental wellbeing among women after childbirth. Investigating the prevalence and risk factors of PPD among postpartum women could shed some light on their mental and emotional states; so that support measures and tailored interventions from health professionals and policymakers could be offered to improve the maternal and infant outcomes, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much more research on maternal psychological wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic was strongly recommended to undertake in the middle and low-income countries.","Chen, Li, Xiong, Zheng","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042219","20220225","COVID-19; postpartum depression; prevalence; review; risk factors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27611,""
"Association between Pet Ownership and Mental Health and Well-Being of Canadians Assessed in a Cross-Sectional Study during the COVID-19 Pandemic","The objective of this cross-sectional study was to assess the association between pet ownership and quality of life (QoL), loneliness, anxiety, stress, overall health, and mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic using a One Health perspective. An online bilingual survey was completed by 1500 Canadians in April-May 2021. Socio-demographics, health, QoL, stress and anxiety, loneliness, social support, pet ownership, and attitude towards pets data were collected. Crude and adjusted associations between pet ownership and mental health and well-being indicators were estimated. The 1500 participants were from all provinces and territories, half were women; half of the participants were pet owners by design. The crude association estimates showed that pet owners had poorer QoL, overall health, and mental health than non-pet owners, and were lonelier, more stressed, and more anxious than non-pet owners. Adjusted estimates showed that these associations disappeared with the inclusion of the confounders (socio-economic, demographic, health, and pet-related variables). Our results suggest that there was no association between pet ownership and the mental health and well-being indicators measured in the present study.","Denis-Robichaud, Aenishaenslin, Richard, Desmarchelier, Carabin","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042215","20220225","One Health; companion animal; generalized anxiety disorder; quality of life; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27612,""
"COVID-19 and Physical Distancing Measures: Experience of Psychiatric Professionals in Europe","A The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the organization of psychiatric care. The present study examines how care professionals experienced this period and faced these new constraints weighing on their professional practices. Based on a qualitative research methodology, 13 group interviews with healthcare professionals working in psychiatric wards were conducted in five countries in western Europe. To complement this, 31 individual interviews were carried out in Belgium and France. Public health measures hindered certain therapeutic activities, jeopardized communication, and obliged healthcare professionals to modify and adapt their practices. Confronted with a transformation of their usual roles, healthcare professionals feared a deterioration in the quality of care. Impossible to continue in-person care practices, they resorted to online videoconferencing which went against their idea of care in which the encounter holds an essential place. The lockdown contradicted efforts to co-build care pathways toward readaptation, social reintegration, and recovery, thus reviving the perception of psychiatric hospitalization based on isolation.","Kane, Gourret Baumgart, Rusch, Absil, Deloyer, El-Hage, Marazziti, Pozza, Thome, Tucha, Verwaest, Fond-Harmant, Denis","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042214","20220225","COVID-19; digital technologies; mental health; professional healthcare practices; psychiatry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27613,""
"Anxiety Linked to COVID-19: A Systematic Review Comparing Anxiety Rates in Different Populations","The COVID-19 pandemic has incited a rise in anxiety, with uncertainty regarding the specific impacts and risk factors across multiple populations. A qualitative systematic review was conducted to investigate the prevalence and associations of anxiety in different sample populations in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Four databases were utilised in the search (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO). The review period commenced in April 2021 and was finalised on 5 July 2021. A total of 3537 studies were identified of which 87 were included in the review (sample size: 755,180). Healthcare workers had the highest prevalence of anxiety (36%), followed by university students (34.7%), the general population (34%), teachers (27.2%), parents (23.3%), pregnant women (19.5%), and police (8.79%). Risk factors such as being female, having pre-existing mental conditions, lower socioeconomic status, increased exposure to infection, and being younger all contributed to worsened anxiety. The review included studies published before July 2021; due to the ongoing nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, this may have excluded relevant papers. Restriction to only English papers and a sample size &gt; 1000 may have also limited the range of papers included. These findings identify groups who are most vulnerable to developing anxiety in a pandemic and what specific risk factors are most common across multiple populations.","Saeed, Eslami, Nassif, Simpson, Lal","https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph19042189","20220225","COVID-19; anxiety; mental health; qualitative systematic review","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27614,""
"Mental Health and Quality of Life among Patients with Cancer during the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic: Results from the Longitudinal ONCOVID Survey Study","This longitudinal survey study aimed to investigate the self-reported outcome measures of COVID-19 peritraumatic distress, depression, anxiety, stress, quality of life (QOL), and their associated factors in a cohort of cancer patients treated at a tertiary care hospital during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Surveys were administered at four time points between 1 April 2020 and 18 September 2020. The surveys included the CPDI, DASS-21, and WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires. Survey response rates were high (61.0% to 79.1%). Among the 355 participants, 71.3% were female, and the median age was 62.2 years (IQR, 53.9 to 69.1). The majority (78.6%) were treated with palliative intention. An important proportion of the participants reported symptoms of COVID-19 peritraumatic distress (34.2% to 39.6%), depression (27.6% to 33.5%), anxiety (24.9% to 32.7%), and stress (11.4% to 15.7%) at any time point during the study period. We did not find clinically meaningful mental health and QOL differences during the study period, with remarkably little change in between the pandemic's first and second wave. We found no consistent correlates of mental health or QOL scores, including cancer type, therapy intention, and sociodemographic information. This cohort of cancer patients showed considerable resilience against mental health and QOL deterioration during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","De Jaeghere, Kanervo, Colman, Schrauwen, West, Vandemaele, De Pauw, Jacobs, Hilderson, Saerens, Sundahl, Vandecasteele, Naert, Lapeire, Kruse, Rottey, Lemmens, Denys","https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers14041093","20220225","SARS-CoV-2; cancer; coronavirus 2019; mental health; pandemic; quality of life","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27615,""
"Linear and Nonlinear Effects in Connectedness Structure: Comparison between European Stock Markets","The purpose of this research is to compare the risk transfer structure in Central and Eastern European and Western European stock markets during the 2007-2009 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to the global financial crisis (GFC), the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) created a significant level of risk, causing investors to suffer losses in a very short period of time. We use a variety of methods, including nonstandard like mutual information and transfer entropy. The results that we obtained indicate that there are significant nonlinear correlations in the capital markets that can be practically applied for investment portfolio optimization. From an investor perspective, our findings suggest that in the wake of global crisis and pandemic outbreak, the benefits of diversification will be limited by the transfer of funds between developed and developing country markets. Our study provides an insight into the risk transfer theory in developed and emerging markets as well as a cutting-edge methodology designed for analyzing the connectedness of markets. We contribute to the studies which have examined the different stock markets' response to different turbulences. The study confirms that specific market effects can still play a significant role because of the interconnection of different sectors of the global economy.","Karkowska, Urjasz","https://doi.org/10.3390/e24020303","20220225","COVID-19; crisis; market connectedness; mutual information; stock market; transfer entropy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27616,""
"COVID-19 Pandemic Experiences and Maternal Stress in Neonatal Intensive Care Units","COVID-19 compounds the already high levels of psychological distress experienced by NICU mothers. We aimed to describe the rates of NICU-related maternal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and to determine how COVID-19 experiences correlate with high levels of stress experienced by NICU mothers. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis based on responses to a nationwide online survey to understand the relationship between COVID-19-related experiences and the stress experienced by mothers of infants admitted to U.S. NICUs (<i>n</i> = 108) during the pandemic. Results indicate that 61.9% of surveyed mothers reported experiencing high levels of stress on the Parental Stressor Scale: NICU. COVID-19-related grief was significantly associated with higher levels of maternal stress, as it related to seeing the baby's appearance and behavior in the NICU and exposure to sights and sounds within the NICU environment. No significant associations were noted between parental stress and COVID-19-related health worries or worries about resources. Of note, our recruitment relied on convenience sampling, limiting the generalizability of study results. In conclusion, mothers who experience COVID-19-related grief appear to be more vulnerable to NICU-related stress. Prioritizing parent involvement and enhancing psychosocial support are essential strategies to mitigate the long-term consequences of heightened stress for NICU families.","Erdei, Feldman, Koire, Mittal, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3390/children9020251","20220225","COVID-19 grief; NICU; anxiety; parent mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27617,""
"COVID-19 during Gestation: Maternal Implications of Evoked Oxidative Stress and Iron Metabolism Impairment","COVID-19 has reached pandemic proportions worldwide, with considerable consequences for both health and the economy. In pregnant women, COVID-19 can alter the metabolic environment, iron metabolism, and oxygen supply of trophoblastic cells, and therefore have a negative influence on essential mechanisms of fetal development. The purpose of this study was to investigate, for the first time, the effects of COVID-19 infection during pregnancy with regard to the oxidative/antioxidant status in mothers' serum and placenta, together with placental iron metabolism. Results showed no differences in superoxide dismutase activity and placental antioxidant capacity. However, antioxidant capacity decreased in the serum of infected mothers. Catalase activity decreased in the COVID-19 group, while an increase in 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, hydroperoxides, 15-FT-isoprostanes, and carbonyl groups were recorded in this group. Placental vitamin D, E, and Coenzyme-Q10 also showed to be increased in the COVID-19 group. As for iron-related proteins, an up-regulation of placental DMT1, ferroportin-1, and ferritin expression was recorded in infected women. Due to the potential role of iron metabolism and oxidative stress in placental function and complications, further research is needed to explain the pathogenic mechanism of COVID-19 that may affect pregnancy, so as to assess the short-term and long-term outcomes in mothers' and infants' health.","Moreno-Fernandez, Ochoa, De Paco Matallana, CaÃƒÂ±o, MartÃƒÂ­n-Alvarez, Sanchez-Romero, Toledano, Puche-Juarez, Prados, Ruiz-Duran, Diaz-Meca, Carrillo, Diaz-Castro","https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox11020184","20220225","COVID-19; antioxidant system; oxidative stress; placenta; pregnancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-02-26","",27618,""

Contrary to expectations, having a full-blown psychiatric pathology seems to positively affect the attitude towards the vaccine, except for PTSD. The intense fear that accompanied the current world emergency has made this pandemic unique; we discuss how it might be one of the factors involved in this result.
