"Individual differences in COVID-19 mitigation behaviors: The roles of age, gender, psychological state, and financial status","The present study examined individual characteristics potentially associated with changes in mitigation behaviors (social distancing and hygiene) recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Analysis of online survey responses from 361 adults, ages 20-78, with US IP addresses, identified significant correlates of adaptive behavioral changes, with implications for preventive strategies and mental health needs. The extent to which individuals changed their mitigation behaviors was unrelated to self-rated health or concern regarding the personal effects of COVID-19 but was related to concern regarding the effects of the pandemic on others. Thus, mitigation behaviors do not appear to be primarily motivated by self-protection. Importantly, adaptive changes in mitigation behaviors increased with age. However, these changes, particularly those related to the frequency of close proximity encounters, appear to be due to age-related decreases in anxiety and depression. Taken together, the present results argue against over-reliance on 'fear appeals' in public health messages as they may increase anxiety and depression. Instead, the present findings argue for more appeals to people's concern for others to motivate mitigation as well as indicating an immediate need to address individual mental health concerns for the sake of society as a whole.","Myerson, Strube, Green, Hale","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257658","20210921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18167,""
"Investigating the impacts of COVID-19 among LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness","LGBTQ2S youth are overrepresented among youth experiencing homelessness and experience significantly higher rates of mental health issues compared to heterosexual and cisgender youth. COVID-19 related challenges for LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness remain unknown. To address this gap, this study aimed to understand the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on LGBTQ2S youth at risk of, and experiencing, homelessness in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada and surrounding areas. Utilizing a mixed-methods convergent parallel design, LGBTQ2S youth experiencing homelessness were recruited to participate in virtual surveys and in-depth one-on-one interviews. Surveys included standardized measures and were administered to measure mental health outcomes and collect information on demographic characteristics, and health service use. Survey data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and statistical tests for difference of proportions. Interviews were analyzed using an iterative thematic content approach. Sixty-one youth completed surveys and 20 youth participated in one-on-one interviews. Quantitative and qualitative data showed that youth have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in various ways, including experiencing poor mental health, such as suicidality, depression, anxiety, and increased substance use, and lack of access to health and social support services. Our study highlights the need for LGBTQ2S inclusive and affirming health care and support services for precariously housed adolescents to address the pre-existing social and health issues that have been exacerbated by the pandemic.","Abramovich, Pang, Moss, Logie, Chaiton, Kidd, Hamilton","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0257693","20210921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18168,""
"See Me Serene: Results from a Pilot Feasibility Study of a Guided Imagery Mobile Application to Reduce COVID-19-Related Stress","The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to concerns about mental health resulting from regional and national lockdowns, social isolation, job loss, and concern about disease exposure. We describe results of the pilot feasibility study of the See Me Serene mHealth app. The app provides users with immersive, vivid, nature experiences to reduce stress and anxiety related to COVID-19 and other isolation. The goals of the study were to develop the See Me Serene app and test the feasibility and acceptability of study procedures, and explore the potential impact of the app on stress and anxiety. We developed and tested the See Me Serene app and our study procedures for feasibility, and gathered preliminary data with a goal of 100 participants. The research was conducted in two phases: 1) development and internal testing of the app; and 2) feasibility and pilot testing with participants recruited online through earned media (e.g., news stories), presentations at a university campus, and social media (e.g., online sharing of earned media and presentations). The feasibility study employed a mixed-methods, within-subjects, pre-/post-test design. At baseline and 30-day follow-up, we assessed stress-related variables via validated self-report measures and saliva for determination of cortisol concentrations. We met or surpassed all our feasibility benchmarks for recruitment (101 participants recruited), retention (91% of 30-day assessment completed), and data collection (99 participants completed all baseline data; 85% of salivary cortisol samples returned). Participants adhered to the intervention. On average, participants listened to 48.2 audio files over 30 days or approximately 1.6 audio files per day. Participants were satisfied with the app with 86.7% rating the as helpful in dealing with stress and anxiety. The app showed the potential to reduce stress, anxiety, loneliness, and worry. We did not find significant differences in cortisol levels over time. Our findings suggest that future research is warranted to test the efficacy of the See Me Serene app with a representative, diverse sample. There is need for evidence based and easily disseminable stress-reduction interventions. See Me Serene is a feasible intervention and has the potential to reduce stress related to COVID-19 and other forms of social isolation. More research on See Me Serene is warranted.","Gordon, Sbarra, Armin, Pace, Gniady, Barraza","https://doi.org/10.2196/32353","20210921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18169,""
"Exploration of severe Covid-19 associated risk factor in China: meta-analysis of current evidence","This meta-analysis aimed to explore potential risk factors for severe Covid-19. We systemically and comprehensively retrieved the eligible study evaluating clinical differences between severe versus non-severe Covid-19. Main effect sizes were demographic characteristics, comorbidities, signs and symptoms, laboratory findings as well as radiological features of chest CT. A total of 2,566 Covid-19 people (771 in the severe group and 1,795 in the non-severe group) from 14 studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. It was demonstrated that older age and males were more likely to have severe Covid-19. Patients with underlying comorbidities, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and COPD were significantly more susceptible to severe Covid-19. Patients with dyspnea were more likely to be severely ill. Depressed total lymphocytes were observed in this article. Meanwhile, although reticulation (30.8%), intrathoracic lymph node enlargement (20.5%) and pleural effusions (30.8%) were relatively infrequent, meta-analysis revealed that patients with these presentations in chest CT were associated with increased risk of severe Covid-19. There are significant differences in clinical characteristic between the severe and non-severe Covid-19 patients. Many factors are related to the severity of the disease, which can help clinicians to differentiate severe patients from non-severe patients.","Zhang, Sun, Xie, Feng, Han","https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.14900","20210921","2019-nCoV; Covid-19; SARS-CoV-2; risk factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18170,""
"Mental health indicators in pregnant women compared with women in the general population during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Denmark","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the associated regulations issued to minimize risk of disease transmission seem to have had an impact on general mental health in most populations, but it may have affected pregnant women even more because of pregnancy-related uncertainties, limited access to healthcare resources, and lack of social support. We aimed to compare the mental health response among pregnant women with that in similarly aged women from the general population during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. From April 14 to July 3, 2020, 647 pregnant women in their second trimester were enrolled in this study. For comparison, 858 women from the general Danish population (20-46Ã‚Â years) were sampled from an ongoing observational study. Participants responded to a questionnaire including six mental health indicators (concern level, perceived social isolation, quality of life, anxiety, mental health, and loneliness). Loneliness was measured using the UCLA Three-item Loneliness Scale and anxiety by the Common Mental Health Disorder Questionnaire 4-item Anxiety Subscale. The pregnant women had better scores during the entire study period for all mental health indicators, and except for concerns, social isolation, and mental health, the differences were also statistically significant. Pregnant women were more concerned about becoming seriously ill (40.2% vs. 29.5%, pÃ‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.001), whereas the general population was more concerned about economic consequences and prospects. Many pregnant women reported negative feelings associated with being pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns regarding social isolation and regulation-imposed partner absence during hospital appointments and childbirth. All mental health indicators improved as Denmark began to reopen after the first wave of the pandemic. Pregnant women exhibited lower rates of poor mental health compared with the general population. However, they were more concerned about becoming seriously ill, expressed negative feelings about being pregnant during the pandemic, and were worried about the absence of their partner due to imposed regulations. These finding may be taken into account by policy-makers during pandemics to balance specific preventive measures over the potential mental health deterioration of pregnant women.","Severinsen, KÃƒÂ¤hler, Thomassen, Varga, Fich Olsen, Hviid, la Cour Freiesleben, Rod, Nielsen","https://doi.org/10.1111/aogs.14258","20210921","anxiety; coronavirus disease 2019; loneliness; mental health; pandemics; pregnancy; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18171,""
"School-Based Suicide Risk Assessment Using eHealth for Youth: Systematic Scoping Review","Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth and a prominent concern for school mental health providers. Indeed, schools play a key role in suicide prevention, including participating in risk assessments with students expressing suicidal ideation. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, many schools now need to offer mental health services, including suicide risk assessment, via eHealth platforms. Post pandemic, the use of eHealth risk assessments will support more accessible services for youth living in rural and remote areas. However, as the remote environment is a new context for many schools, guidance is needed on best practices for eHealth suicide risk assessment among youth. This study aims to conduct a rapid, systematic scoping review to explore promising practices for conducting school-based suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth (ie, information technologies that allow for remote communication). This review included peer-reviewed articles and gray literature published in English between 2000 and 2020. Although we did not find studies that specifically explored promising practices for school-based suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth platforms, we found 12 peer-reviewed articles and 23 gray literature documents that contained relevant information addressing our broader study purpose; thus, these 35 sources were included in this review. We identified five key recommendation themes for school-based suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth platforms in the 12 peer-reviewed studies. These included accessibility, consent procedures, session logistics, safety planning, and internet privacy. Specific recommendation themes from the 23 gray literature documents substantially overlapped with and enhanced three of the themes identified in the peer-reviewed literature-consent procedures, session logistics, and safety planning. In addition, based on findings from the gray literature, we expanded the accessibility theme to a broader theme termed youth engagement, which included information on accessibility and building rapport, establishing a therapeutic space, and helping youth prepare for remote sessions. Finally, a new theme was identified in the gray literature findings, specifically concerning school mental health professional boundaries. A second key difference between the gray and peer-reviewed literature was the former's focus on issues of equity and access and how technology can reinforce existing inequalities. For school mental health providers in need of guidance, we believe that these six recommendation themes (ie, youth engagement, school mental health professional boundaries, consent procedures, session logistics, safety planning, and internet privacy) represent the most promising directions for school-based suicide risk assessment among youth using eHealth tools. However, suicide risk assessment among youth via eHealth platforms in school settings represents a critical research gap. On the basis of the findings of this review, we provide specific recommendations for future research, including the need to focus on the needs of diverse youth.","Exner-Cortens, Baker, Gray, Fernandez Conde, Rivera, Van Bavel, Vezina, Ambrose, Pawluk, Schwartz, Arnold","https://doi.org/10.2196/29454","20210921","eHealth; mobile phone; risk assessment; school mental health; suicide; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18172,""
"Digital Community Inclusion of Individuals With Serious Mental Illness: A National Survey to Map Digital Technology Use and Community Participation Patterns in the Digital Era","Despite the growing interest in developing and using mobile health (mHealth) and digital technologies in mental health, little is known about the scope and nature of virtual community inclusion. The overarching goal of this study was to understand and conceptualize virtual community inclusion of individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Specific objectives of this study were as follows: (1) mapping the prevalence, trends, and experiences related to mHealth and digital technology use among individuals with SMI; (2) comparing patterns of technology use by individuals with and those without SMI; and (3) examining whether use of mHealth and digital technologies predicts recovery among individuals with SMI. A web-based survey of technology use and virtual participation was developed and distributed among adults with and those without SMI via social media, national email discussion lists, nonprofit organizations, and advocacy groups. A total of 381 adults aged 18 years or older participated in the survey, of whom 199 (52%) identified as having a SMI. Participants with SMI reported significantly greater access to technology and significantly fewer days of face-to-face participation in community activities than those without SMI. Among participants with SMI, greater technology use was positively associated with positive emotions and significantly predicted recovery. This study is the first to explore, map, and conceptualize virtual community inclusion among adults with SMI. Our findings indicate a gap in the literature and research on community inclusion and participation, and emphasize the need for virtual community inclusion, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic and its future implications.","Shpigelman, Tal, Zisman-Ilani","https://doi.org/10.2196/28123","20210921","digital community inclusion; digital community participation; mobile health; recovery; serious mental illness; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18173,""
"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Swiss pregnant and breastfeeding women - a cross-sectional study covering the first pandemic wave","Information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pregnancy and breastfeeding experiences, as well as on perinatal mental health in Switzerland is limited. In Switzerland, there are few national studies and little information. Using an anonymous online survey accessible after the first wave of the outbreak in Switzerland, we have investigated how this pandemic affected pregnant and breastfeeding women. Among women who completed the survey, 69.0% (1050/1518) indicated the first wave of the pandemic affected their personal habits, 61.0% (689/1131) were affected in their work and 40.0% (632/1573) reported impaired relations with healthcare services (different denominators correspond to the number of participants who answered the question). 36.8% (110/299) of women reported an impact of the pandemic on their current pregnancy experience or breastfeeding experience (8.2%, 46/555). Overall, 11.6% (170/1467) of participants who completed the validated screening tests for mental health symptoms (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7, Perceived Stress Scale) presented a score compatible with symptoms of major depression, severe anxiety or high perceived stress, which is higher than in the pre-pandemic period according to literature. Risk factors independently associated with impaired mental health were being hospitalized, having symptoms of COVID-19, living with a person with COVID-19 symptoms, having comorbidities, having experienced reduced healthcare services, having restricted usual activities and being a housewife. Protective factors independently associated were a high level of education and living with a partner. Our findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic might have significantly affected the well-being and mental health of pregnant and breastfeeding women, directly in the case of exposure, and indirectly as a result of the potential modifications in their life habits and in healthcare facilities.","Lambelet, Ceulemans, Nordeng, Favre, Horsch, Stojanov, Winterfeld, Baud, Panchaud, Pomar","https://doi.org/10.4414/smw.2021.w30009","20210921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18174,""
"Grandparents' Mental Health and Lived Experiences while Raising Their Grandchildren at the Forefront of COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia","Understanding grandparents' lived experiences and healthy aging is essential to designing efficient, effective, and safe services to support a family structure in which grandparents care for their grandchildren. However, no study to date has explored this concept in an Arab and Muslim country during a pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine grandparents' experiences raising their grandchildren to provide recommendations for needed mental health interventions during and after COVID-19. We used a phenomenological approach to gain a detailed and in-depth understanding of the lived experiences of 15 grandparents caring for their grandchildren. This study shows the need for support service interventions (support groups, health professional support, and respite care) for grandparents in Saudi Arabia, especially during global crises like COVID-19, that enhance social distance and social isolation.

"The association between COVID-19, personal wellbeing, depression, and suicide risk factors in Australian autistic adults","The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the mental health and wellbeing of the world's population, with particularly negative effects on vulnerable populations, including autistic people. Although some consensus regarding specific impact on aspects of wellbeing and mental health in autism is starting to emerge, it is unclear whether the pandemic has increased suicide risk. The goals of this study were to examine (a) potential associations between COVID-19 impact and depression, personal wellbeing, and suicide risk factors in Australian autistic adults and (b) age and gender effects. The COVID-19 Impact Scale (CIS), Personal Wellbeing Index, Patient Health Questionnaire, and the Suicide Behavior Questionnaire, Revised (SBQ-R), were administered to 111 autistic adults aged 20 to 71Ã¢â‚¬â€°years during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia. COVID-19 impact showed small associations with poorer personal wellbeing (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-0.224, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.023, [-0.409, -0.016]) and higher depressive symptoms (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.268, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.006, [0.056, 0.445]) and was not associated with the SBQ-R suicide risk score (rÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.081, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.418, [-0.118, 0.264). No significant effects were identified for age. Although model results were similar for women and men, the strength of the associations between personal wellbeing and depression (zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-2.16, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.015), and depression and SBQ-R suicide risk (zÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 1.961, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã‚Â 0.025), were stronger in women than in men. Qualitative analysis of an open response question from the CIS suggested that the pandemic had both positive and negative impacts on participants. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a large impact on the mental health and wellbeing of the world's population, particularly vulnerable populations such as autistic people. It is not known if these impacts on mental health and wellbeing have increased suicide risk.

"Mental health and factors related to life satisfaction in nursing home and community-dwelling older adults during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey","The geriatric population is supposed to be at high risk for psychological distress as well as adverse outcomes and mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to investigate the levels of depression, anxiety, death anxiety and life satisfaction levels and factors related to life satisfaction in individuals aged 65Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older during the pandemic and to compare these variables between nursing home (NH) and community-dwelling older adults. This study has a cross-sectional and descriptive design, and a total of 133 nursing NH and community-dwelling older adults were enrolled in the study. Turkish death anxiety scale (TDAS), life satisfaction scale (SLS) and depression anxiety stress scale-21 (DASS-21) were used for the assessment. The majority of the older adults had no or mild depression, anxiety and stress symptoms in spite of the prolonged confinements, and were slightly satisfied with their lives. However, depression, anxiety, stress and TDAS levels were higher in participants aged 80Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and older. Residents of NHs had higher TDAS, depression and anxiety levels and lower SLS levels than community-dwelling older adults. Participants who were meeting their children and/or grandchildren less than 2Ã¢â‚¬â€°h a week, were found to have significantly lower SLS and higher depression scores. The increase in depression and TDAS scores predicted a decrease in SLS scores in older adults. As NH resident older adults have higher psychological distress and decreased life satisfaction due to the social isolation caused by the prolonged confinements, NH staff should be regularly informed on both preventive measures and mental health consequences of the pandemic, and should be trained for basic therapeutic interventions.

"Social and Clinical Impact of COVID-19 on Patients with Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva","Background COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a severe inflammatory condition. Patients with pre-existing conditions including diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease are at particularly high risk of complications. Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an ultra-rare and debilitating genetic disorder that is characterized by a pro-inflammatory state, which leads to progressive heterotopic ossification and complications after trauma, including intramuscular vaccinations. To better understand the impact of COVID-19 on patients with FOP, we first examined the social impact of the pandemic using data from the FOP Registry managed by the International FOP Association. We also identified patients with FOP who were exposed to or contracted the SARS-CoV-2 virus, or who received a COVID-19 vaccine, to investigate if patients with FOP were at increased risks of complications from SARS-CoV2 exposure. Results Data from 326 individuals in 69 countries were examined in the International FOP Association FOP Connection Registry using patient-reported outcomes measurement information system (PROMIS) global health scale scores. Twenty-six (28.9%) participants agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°15 years old rated their satisfaction with their social activities and relationships as poor in 2020, which was an increase from 18 (18.9%) in 2019, prior to the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Similar trends were noted for physical and mental health in the pediatric population. Frequency of physician visits was not changed, but a larger portion of patients reported missing dental visits in 2020 compared with 2019 (31.5% vs. 41.7%). A second cohort with 32 subjects was tracked after SARS-CoV-2 exposure or vaccination. Ten subjects were positively diagnosed with COVID-19, 15 received a COVID-19 vaccine, and seven had high-risk SARS-CoV-2 exposure but either did not have a confirmed clinical diagnosis or tested negative. Subjects who tested positive for the virus showed no major complications or increased FOP disease activity, though our sample size is very limited. Among the 15 subjects who received a COVID-19 vaccine, using the International Clinical Council on FOP guidelines for prophylaxis with ibuprofen or acetaminophen, only one person experienced flare activity at the injection site. Conclusions Patients with FOP showed a significant decrease in social activities that was reflective of the isolation and mobility changes in this debilitated population. In our limited cohort, the majority of the patients with FOP who tested positive for COVID-19 showed no major complications. Also, although limited in sample size, the majority of patients who received a COVID-19 vaccination and followed guidelines from the FOP International Clinical Council tolerated vaccination well. Only one person experiencing flare activity following their injection. Thus, the risks and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination needs to be discussed carefully so as to support informed decisions.","Kou, Kile, Kambampati, Brady, Wallace, De Sousa, Cheung, Dickey, Wentworth, Hsiao","https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-885603/v1","20210921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18178,""

"Stakeholder based weights of new sustainability indicators providing pandemic resilience for residential buildings","During COVID-19, the building and service characteristics of residential buildings turned out to be more critical due to lockdowns. The present research assesses the importance of new sustainability indicators for residential buildings in three categories (e.g., Health and Safety, Environmental Resources Consumption, and Comfort) that provide resilience for pandemic periods. The opinions of stakeholders on the identified indicators were collected and then analyzed. 'Health and Safety' category is found to be the most critical among the others. The prevention of virus propagation, mental health, and building air quality are three crucial indicators playing essential roles in the health and safety category. In more detail, innovative smart technologies, including touchless technologies, are identified as a priority in preventing virus propagation. Outdoor spaces and safe indoor places for socialization are weighted as essential in supporting the well-being and mental health of the resident. Finally, air filtration and segregation of medical waste indicators are considered critical in preventing the spread of viruses. There was a consensus among the local and international experts since they did not significantly report differing opinions for the majority of the indicators. However, there was a shift in experts' opinions towards pandemic-oriented indicators compared to conventional sustainability indicators.","Tokazhanov, Tleuken, Durdyev, Otesh, Guney, Turkyilmaz, Karaca","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scs.2021.103300","20210921","COVID-19; Coronavirus; Green buildings; SARS-CoV-2; Stakeholder assessment; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability rating tools","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18180,""
"Mental health prevalence and predictors among university students in nine countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-national study","The student population has been highly vulnerable to the risk of mental health deterioration during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study aimed to reveal the prevalence and predictors of mental health among students in Poland, Slovenia, Czechia, Ukraine, Russia, Germany, Turkey, Israel, and Colombia in a socioeconomic context during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study was conducted among 2349 students (69% women) from May-July 2020. Data were collected by means of the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Gender Inequality Index (GII), Standard &amp; Poor's Global Ratings, the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT), and a sociodemographic survey. Descriptive statistics and Bayesian multilevel skew-normal regression analyses were conducted. The prevalence of high stress, depression, and generalized anxiety symptoms in the total sample was 61.30%, 40.3%, and 30%, respectively. The multilevel Bayesian model showed that female sex was a credible predictor of PSS-10, GAD-7, and PHQ-8 scores. In addition, place of residence (town) and educational level (first-cycle studies) were risk factors for the PHQ-8. This study showed that mental health issues are alarming in the student population. Regular psychological support should be provided to students by universities.","Ochnik, Rogowska, KuÃ…â€ºnierz, Jakubiak, SchÃƒÂ¼tz, Held, ArzenÃ…Â¡ek, Benatov, Berger, Korchagina, Pavlova, BlaÃ…Â¾kovÃƒÂ¡, Aslan, Ãƒâ€¡Ã„Â±nar, Cuero-Acosta","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97697-3","20210921","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18181,""
"Perceived sources of occupational burn-out and embitterment among front-line health workers for COVID-19 control in Gyeonggi province, South Korea: a qualitative study","Front-line health workers (FHWs) for COVID-19 control in South Korea have implemented a labour-intensive contact tracing programme, which places them at high risk for mental health problems. However, a few studies have examined mental health conditions in this population. We employed a qualitative approach to understand the factors perceived as causes of burn-out and embitterment among temporary FHWs to provide recommendations for supporting the workforce. We recruited 20 FHWs to participate in semistructured focus group interviews through purposive sampling. The sample size was determined on the basis of data saturation. We collected data from October to November 2020, audiorecording and transcribing the interviews. Data analysis was conducted manually, applying the principles of grounded theory. Five levels of perceived sources of occupational burn-out and embitterment emerged. FHWs showed considerable mistrust of patients and faced ethical dilemmas in accessing and disclosing personal information. Poor collaboration with community health centre workers and interested parties as well as inadequate organisational support aggravated their conditions. Lack of social recognition and employment instability also presented challenges for FHWs' mental health. The current pandemic response system imposes great moral and emotional burdens on the workforce, prompting the need for initiatives to safeguard the values and needs of those who represent the backbone of the system. This study suggests that multilevel strategies, including providing organisational support and establishing contingency plans for workforce management and resource distribution, may improve FHWs' mental health outcomes as well as the health system for emergency preparedness.","Kang, Kwon, You, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2021-107635","20210921","COVID-19; burnout; mental health; occupational health; psychological; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18182,""
"Psychosocial impact on health-related and non-health related university students during the COVID-19 pandemic Results of an electronic survey","The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused feelings of anxiety, confusion, and panic among the world population. Due to these psychological changes resulting from the stress produced by the disease, we sought to investigate the psychological impact of the pandemic on the university student community. 1,283 students were surveyed, of which 1,149 students were selected. The majority of the subjects were female, and the overall average age was of 20 years. They were provided with an 82-question online questionnaire divided into four sections; looking for the prevalence of significant symptomatology of major depression and generalised anxiety using the PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scales; and factors that potentially affect the mental health of our university population. We found a high prevalence of significant depression (47.08%) and anxiety (27.06%) symptomatology, considering a score of 10 or more as cut-off point. There was no significant difference in depression and anxiety symptomatology between the health-care students and non-health-care students. Our results, together with what is observed in the literature, allow us to conclude that the college student population has a high risk of mental illness, and these should be taken into consideration for the search of effective strategies for detection and control of mental health illnesses. Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 pandemic is a red flag that shows the need to upgrade mental health programmes in universities and to validate virtual instruments.","GarcÃƒÂ­a-Espinosa, Ortiz-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Botello-HernÃƒÂ¡ndez, Aguayo-Samaniego, Leija-Herrera, GÃƒÂ³ngora-Rivera","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rcpeng.2021.04.003","20210921","Ansiedad; Anxiety; COVID-19; College students; DepresiÃƒÂ³n; Depression; Estudiantes universitarios","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18183,""
"Resilience as a mediator between compassion fatigue, nurses' work outcomes, and quality of care during the COVID-19 pandemic","Nurses in the frontline of the battle against COVID-19 are highly vulnerable to compassion fatigue (CF), which may affect their mental health, work effectiveness, and patient safety outcomes. However, no studies have investigated nurses' CF in relation to job outcomes and care quality during the pandemic. This study aims to examine the mediating role of resilience in the relationship between CF and frontline nurses' job outcomes (job satisfaction and turnover intention) and care quality. An online, cross-sectional survey containing five self-report scales was used to collect data from 270 frontline nurses in selected hospitals in the Philippines. Overall, 38.5% of frontline nurses experienced medium to high CF during the second wave of the pandemic. Increased CF was associated with poorer nurse-reported quality of care (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.145, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.019), lower job satisfaction (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.317, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001), and higher organizational turnover intention (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.301, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). Moreover, resilience fully mediated the relationship between CF and quality of care (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.088, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.169), and partially mediated the relationship between CF and job satisfaction (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â -0.259, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001), and CF fatigue and organizational turnover intention (ÃŽÂ²Ã‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.272, pÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 0.001). Frontline nurses are at risk of developing CF during the pandemic. Psychological resilience reduces the negative impact of CF on frontline nurses' job satisfaction, turnover intention, and the quality of care in their assigned unit. Proactive measures to reduce CF should be prioritized by nursing administrators. Resilience-promoting interventions could foster job satisfaction and retention in nurses and, hence, the quality of care delivered in their units.","Labrague, de Los Santos","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apnr.2021.151476","20210921","COVID-19 pandemic; Compassion fatigue; Job satisfaction; Nursing; Quality of care; Resilience; Turnover intention","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18184,""
"Development of a framework for the implementation of synchronous e-mental health: a protocol for a realist synthesis of systematic reviews","<b>Background:Ã‚Â </b>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been necessary to deliver mental health care using technologies (e-mental health). But there have been difficulties in its application. Quantitative systematic reviews such as meta-analysis doesn't allow us to fully identify and properly describe this subject. Thus, our study has two main objectives: a) ""to determine what evidence is available for synchronous e-mental health implementation""; and b) ""to develop a framework informed by a realist analysis for the implementation of synchronous e-mental health"". <b>Methods:Ã‚Â </b>We will search MEDLINE, EBM Reviews, PsycINFO, EMBASE, SCOPUS, CINAHL Complete, and Web of Science databases from 1st January 2015 to September 2020, with no language restriction. A systematic review with a narrative description and a realist synthesis will be conducted. Primary studies relating to adults with common mental health problems using any type of mobile mental health intervention that includes a synchronic component and communication with a mental health professional will be included. For the analysis, we will make a realist synthesis of the systematic reviews, using a grounded theory approach with an emergent approach to synthesize the information, prioritizing the systematic reviews with a lower risk of bias in the AMSTAR-2 tool. The realist synthesis will be based on the interpretation, integration, and inference of the evaluated elements and the generation of hypotheses to better understand the implementation process of synchronous e-mental health. Finally, we will present the overall assessment in a Summary of Qualitative Findings table. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our results will allow a better understanding of the facilitator and limitations in implementing e-mental health.","Villarreal-Zegarra, Alarcon-Ruiz, Melendez-Torres, Torres-Puente, Ambrosio-Melgarejo, Romero-Cabrera, Navarro-Flores, Albitres-Flores, Lindo-Cavero, Huarcaya-Victoria","https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27150.2","20210921","Internet-Based Intervention; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Online Systems; Qualitative Research; Remote Consultation; Systematic Reviews as Topic; Telemedicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-22","",18185,""
"Severe Fatigue in Long COVID: Web-Based Quantitative Follow-up Study in Members of Online Long COVID Support Groups","Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom in patients with persistent complaints following COVID-19 (ie, long COVID). Longitudinal studies examining the intensity of fatigue and differentiating between physical and mental fatigue are lacking. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the severity of fatigue over time in members of online long COVID peer support groups, and (2) assess whether members of these groups experienced mental fatigue, physical fatigue, or both. A 2-wave web-based follow-up study was conducted in members of online long COVID peer support groups with a confirmed diagnosis approximately 3 and 6 months after the onset of infectious symptoms. Demographics, COVID-19 diagnosis, received health care (from medical professionals or allied health care professionals), fatigue (Checklist Individual Strength-subscale subjective fatigue [CIS-Fatigue]; 8-56 points), and physical and mental fatigue (self-constructed questions; 3-21 points) were assessed. Higher scores indicated more severe fatigue. A CIS-Fatigue score Ã¢â€°Â¥36 points was used to qualify patients as having severe fatigue. A total of 239 patients with polymerase chain reaction/computed tomography-confirmed COVID-19 completed the survey 10 weeks (SD 2) and 23 weeks (SD 2) after onset of infectious symptoms, respectively (T1 and T2). Of these 239 patients, 198 (82.8%) were women; 142 (59.4%) had no self-reported pre-existing comorbidities; 208 (87%) self-reported being in good health before contracting COVID-19; and 62 (25.9%) were hospitalized during acute infection. The median age was 50 years (IQR 39-56). The vast majority of patients had severe fatigue at T1 and T2 (n=204, 85.4%, and n=188, 78.7%, respectively). No significant differences were found in the prevalence of normal, mild, and severe fatigue between T1 and T2 (P=.12). The median CIS-Fatigue score was 48 points (IQR 42-53) at T1, and it decreased from T1 to T2 (median change: -2 points, IQR -7 to 3; P&lt;.001). At T1, a median physical fatigue score of 19 points (IQR 16-20) and a median mental fatigue score of 15 points (IQR 10-17) were reported; these scores were lower at T2 for physical but not for mental fatigue (median change for physical fatigue -1 point, IQR -3 to 0, P&lt;.001; median change for mental fatigue 0 points, IQR -3 to 3, P=.52). At the time of completing the follow-up survey, 194/239 (81.2%) and 164/239 (68.6%) of all patients had received care from at least one medical professional and one allied health care professional, respectively. Fatigue in members of online long COVID support groups with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis decreases from 10 to 23 weeks after onset of symptoms. Despite this, severe fatigue remains highly prevalent. Both physical and mental fatigue are present. It remains unclear whether and to what extent fatigue will resolve spontaneously in the longer term.
