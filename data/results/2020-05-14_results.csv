"Informations relatives aux psychotropes et Ã  leurs adaptations Ã©ventuelles pour les patients souffrant de troubles psychiques en France pendant lâ€™Ã©pidÃ©mie Ã  SARS-CoV-2","RÃ©sumÃ© La pandÃ©mie 2019â€“20Â liÃ©e au coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2Â ; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) a des consÃ©quences dramatiques sur les populations en termes de morbi-mortalitÃ© et en terme social, le confinement gÃ©nÃ©ral de prÃ¨s de la moitiÃ© de la population mondiale Ã©tant une situation inÃ©dite dans lâ€™histoire, dont il est difficile aujourdâ€™hui de mesurer lâ€™impact aux niveaux individuel et collectif. Elle touche plus spÃ©cifiquement des personnes prÃ©sentant diffÃ©rents facteurs de risque, qui sont plus frÃ©quents chez les patients souffrant de troubles psychiatriques. Nous avons pratiquÃ© une revue de la littÃ©rature visant Ã  permettre dâ€™Ã©valuer le rapport bÃ©nÃ©fice/risque spÃ©cifique des traitements psychotropes chez des patients souffrant de COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Sur le plan clinique, les symptÃ´mes Ã©vocateurs de la COVID-19 (fiÃ¨vre, toux, dyspnÃ©e, signes digestifs) peuvent Ãªtre provoquÃ©s par diffÃ©rents psychotropes et imposent une vigilance pour Ã©viter faux nÃ©gatifs et faux positifs. Chez les patients atteints, les psychotropes doivent Ãªtre maniÃ©s avec prudence notamment chez les sujets Ã¢gÃ©s, en prenant en compte le risque pulmonaire. Lithium et Clozapine, qui sont des mÃ©dicaments de rÃ©fÃ©rence dans le trouble bipolaire et la schizophrÃ©nie rÃ©sistante, justifient une attention spÃ©cifique. Le sevrage tabagique nÃ©cessaire dans les situations dâ€™insuffisance respiratoire justifie un ajustement posologique pour Ã©viter une mauvaise tolÃ©rance des traitements habituels. Les traitements symptomatiques utilisÃ©s dans la COVID-19Â ont de frÃ©quentes interactions avec les psychotropes les plus utilisÃ©s. Sâ€™il nâ€™existe pas de traitement curatif de lâ€™infection au SARS-CoV-2, les interactions des diffÃ©rentes molÃ©cules actuellement testÃ©es avec plusieurs classes de psychotropes (antidÃ©presseurs, antipsychotiques) sont importantes Ã  prendre en compte du fait de risque de modification de la conduction cardiaque. Les connaissances spÃ©cifiques sur la COVID-19Â restent pauvres aujourdâ€™hui, mais il faut recommander la rigueur, dans ce contexte, lors du maniement des psychotropes, pour Ã©viter de rajouter, chez les patients souffrant de troubles psychiatriques, potentiellement vulnÃ©rables dans le contexte Ã©pidÃ©mique, un risque iatrogÃ¨ne ou de perte dâ€™efficacitÃ©. The 2019â€“20Â coronavirus pandemic (SARS-CoV-2; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) has dramatic consequences on populations in terms of morbidity and mortality and in social terms, the general confinement of almost half of the world's population being a situation unprecedented in history, which is difficult today to measure the impact at the individual and collective levels. More specifically, it affects people with various risk factors, which are more frequent in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders. Psychiatrists need to know: (i) how to identify, the risks associated with the prescription of psychotropic drugs and which can prove to be counterproductive in their association with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), (ii) how to assess in terms of benefit/risk ratio, the implication of any hasty and brutal modification on psychotropic drugs that can induce confusion for a differential diagnosis with the evolution of COVID-19. We carried out a review of the literature aimed at assessing the specific benefit/risk ratio of psychotropic treatments in patients suffering from COVID-19. Clinically, symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 (fever, cough, dyspnea, digestive signs) can be caused by various psychotropic drugs and require vigilance to avoid false negatives and false positives. In infected patients, psychotropic drugs should be used with caution, especially in the elderly, considering the pulmonary risk. Lithium and Clozapine, which are the reference drugs in bipolar disorder and resistant schizophrenia, warrant specific attention. For these two treatments the possibility of a reduction in the dosage â€“Â in case of minimal infectious signs and in a situation, w ich does not allow rapid controlÂ â€“ should ideally be considered taking into account the clinical response (even biological; plasma concentrations) observed in the face of previous dose reductions. Tobacco is well identified for its effects as an inducer of CYP1A2Â enzyme. In a COVID+ patient, the consequences of an abrupt cessation of smoking, particularly related with the appearance of respiratory symptoms (cough, dyspnea), must therefore be anticipated for patients receiving psychotropics metabolized by CYP1A2. Plasma concentrations of these drugs are expected to decrease and can be related to an increase risk of relapse. The symptomatic treatments used in COVID-19Â have frequent interactions with the most used psychotropics. If there is no curative treatment for infection to SARS-CoV-2, the interactions of the various molecules currently tested with several classes of psychotropic drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics) are important to consider because of the risk of changes in cardiac conduction. Specific knowledge on COVID-19Â remains poor today, but we must recommend rigor in this context in the use of psychotropic drugs, to avoid adding, in patients suffering from psychiatric disorders, potentially vulnerable in the epidemic context, an iatrogenic risk or loss of efficiency.","Javelot, H.; Llorca, P.

"Development and Initial Validation of the COVID Stress Scales","Research and clinical observations suggest that during times of pandemic many people exhibit stress- or anxiety-related psychopathology that include fear of becoming infected, fear of coming into contact with possibly contaminated objects or surfaces, fear of foreigners who might be carrying infection (i.e., disease-related xenophobia), fear of the socio-economic consequences of the pandemic, compulsive checking and reassurance-seeking regarding possible pandemic-related threats, and traumatic stress symptoms about the pandemic (e.g., nightmares, intrusive thoughts). We developed the 36-item COVID Stress Scales (CSS) to measure these features, as they pertain to COVID-19. The CSS were developed to better understand and assess COVID-19-related psychopathology. The scales were intentionally designed so they could be readily adapted for future pandemics. The CSS were developed and initially validated in population-representative samples from Canada (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>3,479) and the United States (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>3,375). A stable 5-factor solution was identified, corresponding to scales assessing COVID-related stress and anxiety symptoms: (1) Danger and contamination fears, (2) fears about economic consequences, (3) xenophobia, (4) compulsive checking, and (5) traumatic stress symptoms about COVID-19. The scales performed well on various indices of reliability and validity. The scales were intercorrelated, providing evidence of a COVID Stress Syndrome. The scales offer promise as tools for better understanding the psychopathology associated with COVID-19 and for identifying people in need of mental health services.","Taylor, Steven; Landry, Caeleigh; Paluszek, Michelle; Fergus, Thomas A.; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J.

"Human gene and disease associations for clinical-genomics and precision medicine research","Abstract We are entering the era of personalized medicine in which an individual's genetic makeup will eventually determine how a doctor can tailor his or her therapy. Therefore, it is becoming critical to understand the genetic basis of common diseases, for example, which genes predispose and rare genetic variants contribute to diseases, and so on. Our study focuses on helping researchers, medical practitioners, and pharmacists in having a broad view of genetic variants that may be implicated in the likelihood of developing certain diseases. Our focus here is to create a comprehensive database with mobile access to all available, authentic and actionable genes, SNPs, and classified diseases and drugs collected from different clinical and genomics databases worldwide, including Ensembl, GenCode, ClinVar, GeneCards, DISEASES, HGMD, OMIM, GTR, CNVD, Novoseek, Swiss-Prot, LncRNADisease, Orphanet, GWAS Catalog, SwissVar, COSMIC, WHO, and FDA. We present a new cutting-edge gene-SNP-disease-drug mobile database with a smart phone application, integrating information about classified diseases and related genes, germline and somatic mutations, and drugs. Its database includes over 59Â 000 protein-coding and noncoding genes; over 67Â 000 germline SNPs and over a million somatic mutations reported for over 19Â 000 protein-coding genes located in over 1000 regions, published with over 3000 articles in over 415 journals available at the PUBMED; over 80Â 000 ICDs; over 123Â 000 NDCs; and over 100Â 000 classified gene-SNP-disease associations. We present an application that can provide new insights into the information about genetic basis of human complex diseases and contribute to assimilating genomic with phenotypic data for the availability of gene-based designer drugs, precise targeting of molecular fingerprints for tumor, appropriate drug therapy, predicting individual susceptibility to disease, diagnosis, and treatment of rare illnesses are all a few of the many transformations expected in the decade to come.","Ahmed, Zeeshan; Zeeshan, Saman; Mendhe, Dinesh; Dong, XinQi","https://doi.org/10.1002/ctm2.28","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-14","",961,""
"The positive effects of covid-19","As the coronavirus pandemic continues its deadly path, dramatic changes in how people live are reducing some instances of other medical problems. Bryn Nelson writes that the irony may hold valuable lessons for public health Doctors and researchers are noticing some curious and unexpectedly positive side effects of the abrupt shifts in human behaviour in response to the covid-19 pandemic. Skies are bluer, fewer cars are crashing, crime is falling, and some other infectious diseases are fading from hospital emergency departments. Other changes are unquestionably troubling. American doctors have expressed alarm over a nosedive in patients presenting to emergency departments with heart attacks, strokes, and other conditions, leading to fears that patients are too afraid of contracting covid-19 to seek necessary medical care.1 Calls to poison control centres are up by around 20%, attributed to a rise in accidents with cleaners and disinfectants even before President Trump questioned whether injected disinfectants might stop the virus.2 Calls to suicide prevention lines are skyrocketing, while health experts are fretting about signs of rising alcohol and drug use, poorer diets, and a lack of exercise among those cooped-up at home.3 Millions of people are hungry and unemployed. But doctors, researchers, and public health officials say the pandemic is also providing a unique window through which to view some positive health effects from major changes in human behaviour. And the pandemic may lead to a public more willing to accept and act on public health messages.

Unfortunately, there is no formula or operating manual for how to cope with the current global pandemic. Previous research has documented an array of responses to mass crises or disasters, including chronic anxiety and posttraumatic stress as well as resilience and recovery. Much can be learned from this research about how people have coped in the past in order to identify strategies that may be particularly effective in managing distress and cultivating resilience during these perilous times. We delineate multiple coping strategies (e.g., behavioral activation, acceptance-based coping, mindfulness practice, loving-kindness practices) geared to decrease stress and promote resilience and recovery. These strategies may be especially effective because they help individuals make meaning, build distress tolerance, increase social support, foster a view of our deep human interconnectedness, and take goal-directed value-driven actions in midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Polizzi, C.; Lynn, S.

"[Clinical analysis of suspected COVID-19 patients with anxiety and depression]","OBJECTIVE: To explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in patients with suspected coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) so as to achieve early intervention and better clinical prognosis. METHODS: Seventy-six patients with suspected COVID-19 in fever isolation wards of Second Hospital of Lanzhou University were enrolled From January 31, 2020 to February 22, 2020. Their clinical baseline data were collected. The anxiety of patients was assessed by Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and the depression of patients was assessed by Hamilton Depression Scale. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors of anxiety and depression in these patients. RESULTS: Female patients are more likely to have anxiety (OR=3.206, 95%CI: 1.073-9.583, P<0.05) and depression (OR=9.111, 95%CI: 2.143-38.729, P<0.01) than male patients; patients with known contact history of epidemic area and personnel in epidemic area are more likely to have depression (OR=3.267, 95%CI: 1.082-9.597, P<0.05).

"Prevalence and correlates of PTSD and depressive symptoms one month after the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in a sample of home-quarantined Chinese university students","Background : When COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019, most citizens were home-quarantined to prevent the spread of the virus. This study explored the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression in a sample of home-quarantined college students to identify the psychological distress risk factors. Method : The PTSD and depressive symptoms in the 2485 participants from 6 universities were investigated using online survey versions of the PTSD Checklist Civilian Version and the 9-question Patient Health Questionnaires (PHQ-9), and data on sleep durations, exposure, home-quarantine time and socio-demographic variables were also collected. Results : The PTSD and depression prevalence were found to be 2.7% and 9.0%. Subjectively, feeling extreme fear was the most significant risk factor for psychological distress, followed by short sleep durations, being in their graduating year (4th year) and living in severely afflicted areas. Sleep durations was a mediator between exposures and mental health problems. Conclusions : The results suggested that the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 could be serious. Psychological interventions that reduce fear and improve sleep durations need to be made available to the home-quarantined university students, and graduating students and those in the worst-hit areas should be given priority focus.","Tang, Wanjie; Hu, Tao; Hu, Baodi; Jin, Chunhan; Wang, Gang; Xie, Chao; Chen, Sen; Xu, Jiuping","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2020.05.009","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-14","",991,""
"COVID-19 Fear in Eastern Europe: Validation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale","COVID-19 is a major source of fear, stress, and anxiety as well as a major factor impacting the health and wellbeing of people worldwide. The present study builds on the recently developed â€œFear of COVID-19 Scaleâ€ (Ahorsu et al., In International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction, https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00270-8, 2020). The sample comprised of 850 participants, male and female young adults from Russia and Belarus. The majority of survey participants are university students and graduates. Females, students, and others from Russia report higher levels of COVID-19-related fear than those from Belarus. Respondents from Russia and Belarus report less fear than people from Iran who were surveyed earlier. The scale used for the present survey evidenced a good Cronbachâ€™s Alpha measure of internal consistency or reliability (0.809). Clearly, further research is needed across locations and over time about the nature and extent of fear caused by COVID 19. Overall, the FCV-19S appears to be a valuable and brief instrument that may provide useful information for intervention and policy purposes to migrate fear and problem behavior linked to infectious disease outbreaks.","Reznik, Alexander; Gritsenko, Valentina; Konstantinov, Vsevolod; Khamenka, Natallia; Isralowitz, Richard","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11469-020-00283-3","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-14","",992,""

"COVID-19 Impact Among Spine Surgeons in Latin America","Study Design:Cross-sectional study.Objective:The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in spine surgeons in Latin America.Methods:A questionnaire was sent to Latin American spine surgeons from April 4 to 6, 2020. Surgeon characteristics were recorded. The impact of COVID-19 on economic well-being, work, and mental health were also determined. All variables were compared and analyzed.Results:Two hundred four surgeons answered the complete survey; most of them were male (96.6%), the average age was 47.7 years; 58.8% (n = 120) were orthopedic surgeons and 41.2% (n = 84) were neurosurgeons. The majority of the respondents were from Argentina (59.8%, n = 122), followed by Brazil (17.2%, n = 35), Chile (6.4%, n = 13), and Mexico (5.9%, n = 12). Most of the surgeons reported performing emergency procedures only during the pandemic (76.5%, n = 156). Half used telemedicine or online consultation modalities (54.4%, n = 111). The average concern about the financial situation due to the pandemic was 7.53 in a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the worst scenario). Twenty-two percent (n = 45) of the surgeons had a score over 10 in the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9; scores higher than 10 needs referral to confirm depression diagnosis). Young age and neurosurgery as a specialty were associated with higher PHQ-9 scores.Conclusions:COVID-19 has an impact in the daily working practice and financial situation of spine surgeons in Latin America.

"Challenges and burden of the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic for child and adolescent mental health: a narrative review to highlight clinical and research needs in the acute phase and the long return to normality","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is profoundly affecting life around the globe. Isolation, contact restrictions and economic shutdown impose a complete change to the psychosocial environment in affected countries. These measures have the potential to threaten the mental health of children and adolescents significantly. Even though the current crisis can bring with it opportunities for personal growth and family cohesion, disadvantages may outweigh these benefits. Anxiety, lack of peer contact and reduced opportunities for stress regulation are main concerns. Another main threat is an increased risk for parental mental illness, domestic violence and child maltreatment. Especially for children and adolescents with special needs or disadvantages, such as disabilities, trauma experiences, already existing mental health problems, migrant background and low socioeconomic status, this may be a particularly challenging time. To maintain regular and emergency child and adolescent psychiatric treatment during the pandemic is a major challenge but is necessary for limiting long-term consequences for the mental health of children and adolescents. Urgent research questions comprise understanding the mental health effects of social distancing and economic pressure, identifying risk and resilience factors, and preventing long-term consequences, includingâ€”but not restricted toâ€”child maltreatment. The efficacy of telepsychiatry is another highly relevant issue is to evaluate the efficacy of telehealth and perfect its applications to child and adolescent psychiatry. There are numerous mental health threats associated with the current pandemic and subsequent restrictions. Child and adolescent psychiatrists must ensure continuity of care during all phases of the pandemic. COVID-19-associated mental health risks will disproportionately hit children and adolescents who are already disadvantaged and marginalized. Research is needed to assess the implications of policies enacted to contain the pandemic on mental health of children and adolescents, and to estimate the risk/benefit ratio of measures such as home schooling, in order to be better prepared for future developments.","Fegert, JÃ¶rg M.; Vitiello, Benedetto; Plener, Paul L.; Clemens, Vera","https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-020-00329-3","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-14","",996,""
"Mental Health Interventions during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Conceptual Framework by Early Career Psychiatrists","The emergence of mental health (MH) problems during a pandemic is extremely common, though difficult to address due to the complexities of pandemics and the scarcity of evidence about the epidemiology of pandemic-related MH problems and the potential interventions to tackle them. Little attention has been devoted so far to this topic from policymakers, stakeholders and researchers, resulting in a lack of replicable, scalable and applicable frameworks to help plan, develop and deliver MH care during pandemics. As a response, we have attempted to develop a conceptual framework (CF) that could guide the development, implementation, and evaluation of MH interventions during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This CF was developed by early career psychiatrists from 16 countries that cover all the WHO regions. Their opinions were elicited via a semi-structured questionnaire. They were asked to provide their views about the current MH situation in their countries and to elaborate on existing 'myths' and misinformation. They were also asked to name the resources available and to propose solutions and approaches to provide accessible and affordable care. The CF was prepared based on the extant literature and the views discussed in this group; it illustrates the epidemiology of MH problems, preparedness plans, stage-specific plans or innovative solutions, opportunities to integrate those plans and possible outcomes at policy level. This CF can serve as a technical guide for future research regarding pandemics. It can be used to monitor trends and to optimize efforts, and to develop evidence based MH interventions. Still, further research focusing on the individual components of this framework is needed.","Ransing, Ramdas; Adiukwu, Frances; Pereira-Sanchez, Victor; Ramalho, Rodrigo; Orsolini, Laura; Teixeira, AndrÃ© Luiz Schuh; Gonzalez-Diaz, Jairo M.; da Costa, Mariana Pinto; Soler-Vidal, Joan; BytyÃ§i, Drita Gashi; El Hayek, Samer; Larnaout, Amine; Shalbafan, Mohammadreza; Syarif, Zulvia; Nofal, Marwa; Kundadak, Ganesh Kudva","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2020.102085","2020","","WHO","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","2020-05-14","",997,""
