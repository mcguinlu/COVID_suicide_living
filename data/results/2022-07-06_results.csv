"Conspiracy mentality among informal caregivers as a risk factor for caregiver burden, mental health, perceived loneliness and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: findings of a representative online study from Germany","This study aims to analyze if and how conspiracy mentality is associated with mental health, burden and perceived social isolation and loneliness of informal caregivers of older individuals with care needs. A quantitative, cross-sectional study was conducted. Participants had to be at least 40Ã‚Â years of age and were drawn randomly from the German online panel forsa.omninet and questioned between theÃ‚Â 4th and 19th ofÃ‚Â March 2021. A sample of 489 informal caregivers (relatives and non-relatives supporting individuals agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬â€°60Ã‚Â years) was questioned. Conspiracy mentality, depressive symptoms, loneliness and social exclusion were measured with validated instruments (e.g., The Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire). Questions referred to the last three months prior to assessment. Multiple linear regression analyses, adjusted for sociodemographic, economic and health factors and indicators of the pandemic, were conducted. Findings indicate a significant positive association between conspiracy mentality and caregiver burden, loneliness, social exclusion, and depressive symptoms. No gender differences were found for any outcome. The results indicate that conspiracy mentality could be a risk factor for mental health, perceived social isolation and loneliness, and contribute to increased caregiver burden among informal caregivers of older care recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic. Accordingly, informal caregivers could benefit from actions focused on reducing conspiracy mentality during a health crisis, which could improve psychosocial health and wellbeing in this vulnerable group.","Zwar, KÃƒÂ¶nig, Hajek","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-022-03177-0","20220705","Burden; Conspiracy mentality; Informal care; Loneliness; Mental health; Social isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33779,""
"Diabetes self-management during the COVID-19 pandemic and its associations with COVID-19 anxiety syndrome, depression, and health anxiety","The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health have been profound. Mental health and diabetes self-care are inter-related. We examined whether COVID-19 anxiety, depressive symptoms and health anxiety were associated with domains of diabetes self-management and investigated whether greater COVID-19 anxiety syndrome would independently contribute to suboptimal diabetes self-care. Surveys were sent to people attending diabetes clinics of three London hospitals. Participants completed the Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ), the COVID-19 Anxiety Syndrome Scale (C-19 ASS), which measures perseveration and avoidant maladaptive coping behaviour, assessed with measures of co-existent depressive symptoms and anxiety, controlling for age, gender, and social deprivation. Clinical data, including pre- and post-lockdown HbA1c measures, were obtained from hospital records for 369 respondents a response rate of 12.8% RESULTS: Depressive symptom scores were high. Both pre-existing health anxiety and depressive symptoms were independently linked to improvable measures of diabetes care, as was lower socioeconomic rank. However, avoidant COVID-19 anxiety responses were independently associated with higher diabetes self-care scores. HbA1c levels improved modestly over the year of UK lockdown in this cohort. During the height of lockdown, avoidant coping behaviours characteristic of the COVID-19 anxiety syndrome may in fact work to improve diabetes self-care, at least in the short term. We recommend screening for depressive symptoms and being aware of the significant minority of people with COVID-19 anxiety syndrome who may now find it difficult to re-engage with face-to-face clinic opportunities.","Distaso, Malik, Semere, AlHakami, Alexander, Hirani, Shah, Suba, McKechnie, NikÃ„ÂeviÃ„â€¡, Oliver, Spada, Salem","https://doi.org/10.1111/dme.14911","20220705","COVID-19; HbA1c; anxiety; depression; diabetes; maladaptation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33780,""
"Living with COVID-19: Subjective Well-Being in the Second Phase of the Pandemic","While there is ample evidence of the decline in mental health among youth during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, less is known about the determinants of recovery, which is the focus of this study. Drawing on a stress process framework, this study examines the associations of changes in direct, pandemic-related, and indirect, lockdown-related stressors with life satisfaction. A novel representative, longitudinal sample of British 16-25-year-olds is used, drawing on 6 data collections between February 2021 to May 2022 (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6000, 51% female, 24% ethnic minority, 46% in work, 35% with higher education). Using linear fixed-effects regression models, the findings suggest a substantial improvement in life satisfaction among youth. An increasing frequency of social contacts, receding worries about career prospects and job skills learning contributed significantly to increases in life satisfaction, whereas direct, health-related COVID-19 stressors did not affect life satisfaction. Sub-group analysis suggests that women's, adolescents', and students' life satisfaction responded more strongly to the stressors considered in this study. The findings highlight the positive effects of less stringent lockdown restrictions, economic recovery, and opportunities for job skills learning on youth's happiness.","Henseke, Green, Schoon","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-022-01648-8","20220705","Adolescents and Emerging Adulthood; COVID-19; Life Satisfaction; Panel Study; Stress Process Framework","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33781,""
"Measures of Daily Activities Associated With Mental Health (Things You Do Questionnaire): Development of a Preliminary Psychometric Study and Replication Study","A large body of research has identified modifiable cognitions and behaviors (actions) associated with psychological health. However, little is known regarding the actions that are most strongly associated with psychological health or the frequency with which they should be performed. This paper described 2 studies that used survey methodology to create the Things You Do Questionnaire (TYDQ), which aims to identify and rank actions (items) and domains of actions (factors) most strongly associated with psychological health. We used digital marketing strategies to recruit Australian adult participants, who were asked to complete 2 web-based surveys comprising versions of the TYDQ; validated measures of depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with life; and demographic questions. In study 1, a total of 3040 participants rated how often they performed each of the 96 items comprising the TYDQ. This design was replicated in study 2, in which a 59-item version of the TYDQ was completed by 3160 participants. In both studies, the factor structure and validity were examined, as were the associations between individual TYDQ items and 3 mental health outcomes: depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with life. In study 1, factor analyses revealed that a 5-factor model comprising 27 items achieved an optimum balance between brevity and variance and accounted for 38.1%, 31.4%, and 33.2% of the variance in scores on measures of depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with life, respectively. The factors were interpreted as realistic thinking, meaningful activities, goals and plans, healthy habits, and social connections. These 5 factors were more strongly associated with psychological health than those such as practicing kindness, exercising gratitude, and practicing spirituality. This pattern of results was replicated across gender, age groups, and depression severity. The 5-factor solution found in study 1 was replicated in study 2. Analyses revealed that a 21-item version accounted for 46.8%, 38.2%, and 38.1% of the variance in scores on measures of depression, anxiety, and satisfaction with life, respectively. These findings indicate that some actions are more strongly associated with psychological health than others and that these activities fall within 5 broad domains, which represent skills often taught in psychological treatments. Subsequent studies are planned to explore the reliability of these items and results in other samples and to examine patterns of change in scores during treatment for anxiety and depression. If replicated, these efforts will assist in the development of new psychological interventions and provide an evidence base for public mental health campaigns designed to promote good mental health and prevent the emergence of common mental disorders.","Titov, Dear, Bisby, Nielssen, Staples, Kayrouz, Cross, Karin","https://doi.org/10.2196/38837","20220705","COVID-19; anxiety; behavior; cognitions; depression; habits; mechanisms; psychological well-being; satisfaction with life; survey","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33782,""

"Bullying and other risk factors related to adolescent suicidal behaviours in the Philippines: a look into the 2011 GSHS Survey","The present study retrospectively examined gender differences in bullying and suicidal behaviour (ideation, plan, and attempts) as well as associations between selected risk factors and suicidal behaviour among secondary school Filipino students. The study used a secondary data set from the GSHS developed by the World Health Organization, which was conducted in the Philippines in 2011. Participants included 5290 Filipino students (male NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2279, female NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2986). A two-tailed Chi-square of independence was used to test for gender differences and a multivariate logistic regression model explored statistical associations between risk factors and outcome variables. Chi-square results suggested that gender differences were statistically significant for being bullied Ãâ€¡2 (1, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2384)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.6, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, experiencing suicidal ideation Ãâ€¡2 (1, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°857)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°61.7, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.000, making suicide plans Ãâ€¡2 (1, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°590)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°10.2, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001, and suicide attempts Ãâ€¡2 (1, NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°674)Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°8.4, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°.004, with females showing higher vulnerability to examined risk factors. The logistic regression model also suggested that adolescents claiming to have no close friends were three to four times more likely to attempt suicide. Other strong predictors of suicidal behaviours were loneliness and getting in trouble due to alcohol consumption. Bullying is an independent yet, not the strongest predictor associated with adolescents' suicidal behaviour in the present study. The strongest predictors of Filipino adolescents' suicidal behaviours in the 2011 cohort included having no close friends, loneliness, anxiety and getting in trouble due to alcohol use among both genders. Peer and mental health support programmes need to be made available and accessible for adolescents in the Philippines. Considering the increase in suicide rates in 2020/2021 among Filipino young adults due to the Coronavirus pandemic, it is suggested that preventing suicidal vulnerability in adolescence can hinder this occurrence later on in the lifetime.","Chiu, Vargo","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-022-04085-w","20220705","Adolescents; Bullying; Gender differences; Loneliness; Philippines; Suicidal behaviour","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33784,""
"Stress Resilience Program for Health Care Professionals During a Pandemic: A Pilot Program","The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased burnout and staff turnover for health care providers (HCPs). The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the safety and acceptability of a Stress Resilience Program (SRP) for reducing perceived stress and improving resilience among HCPs during a pandemic. Of the 12 HCPs expressing interest in the study, 10 were enrolled in this study. Participants attended three in-person visits (consent/screen, baseline, and end-of-study). The SRP consisted of education related to resilience enhancement and a breathing device (<i>BreatherFitÃ‚Â®</i>) for combined respiratory muscle training (cRMT). Participants completed 4 weeks of cRMT and applied situational breathing strategies as needed. Outcomes measured were changes in stress (PSS-10), resilience (BRS), depression (PRIME-MD), and sleep (PSQI and <i>Ã…Å’ura RingÃ‚Â®</i>). The majority of participants were male (60%) and White (60%) with an average age of 39.7 years. Changes from baseline to end-of-treatment indicated a positive trend with significant stress reduction (-3.2 Ã‚Â± 3.9, <i>p</i> = .028) and nonsignificant depression reduction (-0.5 Ã‚Â± 0.7, <i>p</i> = .05). Resilience was high at baseline and continued to stay high during the study with a nonsignificant increase at end-of-study (+0.07 Ã‚Â± 0.7, <i>p</i> = .77). No changes in overall sleep scores were noted. All participants agreed the study was worthwhile, 80% indicated they would repeat the experience, while 90% indicated they would recommend the study to others. Because of its size and portability, SRP is an easily applicable and promising option for reducing stress among HCPs during a high-stress period, such as a pandemic. Larger studies are needed.","Croghan, Hurt, Fokken, Fischer, Lindeen, Schroeder, Ganesh, Ghosh, Bausek, Bauer","https://doi.org/10.1177/21650799221093775","20220705","COVID-19; anxiety; health care provider; respiratory muscle training; stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33785,""
"Mental health and wellbeing among people with informal caring responsibilities across different time points during the COVID-19 pandemic: a population-based propensity score matching analysis","Due to a prolonged period of national and regional lockdown measures during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, there has been an increase reliance on informal care for informal carers. In light of this, the current study compared the experiences of carers and non-carers on various mental health and wellbeing measures across six key time points during the pandemic. Data analysed were from the University College London (UCL) COVID -19 Social Study. Our study focused on six time points in England: (1) the first national lockdown (March-April 2020); (2) the beginning of first lockdown rules easing (May 2020); (3) the second national lockdown (November 2020); (4) the third national lockdown (January 2021); (5) the easing of the third lockdown (March 2021); and (6) the end of restrictions (July-August 2021). We considered five mental health and wellbeing measures: depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness, life satisfaction, and sense of being worthwhile. Propensity score matching was applied for the analyses. We found that informal carers experienced higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms than non-carers across much of the pandemic. During the first national lockdown, carers also experienced a higher sense of life being worthwhile. No association was found between informal caring responsibilities and levels of loneliness and life satisfaction. Given that carers are an essential national healthcare support, especially during a pandemic, it is crucial to integrate carers' needs into healthcare planning and delivery. These results highlight that there is a pressing need to provide adequate and targeted mental health support for carers during and following this pandemic.","Mak, Bu, Fancourt","https://doi.org/10.1177/17579139221104973","20220705","COVID-19; informal carers; mental health; mental wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33786,""
"A qualitative study on mothers' experiences attending an online infant massage class: ""It is funny!

This study aimed to explore the experiences of mothers who had attended online infant massage classes.Ã‚ METHODS: This qualitative survey recruited 12 Indonesian mothers who had infants agedÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°12Ã‚Â months and joined the online infant massage class. An open-ended question form was used to collect data, which were analyzed using thematic content analysis. There were six themes related to the experiences of mothers attending online infant massage classes: favorite session, new knowledge and skills, benefits, barriers during infant massage class, factors related to infant massage practice, and mother's hope. Mothers had a good experience learning infant massage and had better interaction with their infants after the class. The findings show that an online infant massage class could benefit both mothers and infants.","Khuzaiyah, Adnani, Chabibah, Khanifah, Lee","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12912-022-00952-9","20220705","Anxiety; Anxiety disorders; COVID-19; Depression; Fear; Infant; Massage; Mothers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33787,""
"""I had so many life-changing decisions I had to make without support"": a qualitative analysis of women's pregnant and postpartum experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has posed profound challenges for pregnant patients and their families. Studies conducted early in the pandemic found that pregnant individuals reported increased mental health concerns in response to pandemic-related stress. Many obstetric practices changed their healthcare delivery models, further impacting the experiences of pregnant patients. We conducted a survey study to explore the ways in which COVID-19 impacted the lives of pregnant and newly postpartum people. A mixed-methods survey was distributed to all patients Ã¢â€°Â¥18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years old who were pregnant between January 1st, 2020 - April 28, 2021 in a large Midwest health system. Open-ended survey responses were analyzed for common themes using standard qualitative methodology. Among the 1182 survey respondents, 647 women provided an open-ended response. Of these, 77% were in the postpartum period. The majority of respondents identified as white, were partnered or married, and owned their own home. Respondents reported feeling greater uncertainty, social isolation, as though they had limited social and practical support, and negative mental health effects as a result of the pandemic. Many cited sudden or arbitrary changes to their medical care as a contributing factor. Though in the minority, some respondents also reported benefits from the changes to daily life, including perceived improvements to medical care, better work-life balance, and opportunities for new perspectives. This large qualitative dataset provides insight into how healthcare policy and lifestyle changes impacted pregnant and postpartum people. Respondents expressed similar levels of uncertainty and mental health concerns compared to other cohorts but less overall positivity. Our findings suggest greater attention be given to the impact of pandemic-related stress on pregnant and postpartum women. As the pandemic continues, these data identify areas where investment in additional support may have the greatest impact.","Ashby, Riggan, Huang, Torbenson, Long, Wick, Allyse, Rivera-Chiauzzi","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-04816-7","20220705","Mental health; Postpartum; Pregnancy; Qualitative research; SARS-Cov-2","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33788,""
"The recent surge of functional movement disorders: social distress or greater awareness?","To analyze the interrelated factors that have led to the striking increase in functional movement disorders in recent years, with a focus on functional tic-like behaviours (FTLB). The sudden onset of FTLB has been widely observed in several countries since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, whereas it was previously very rarely reported. Pandemic-related FTLB typically occur in young females, share complex, disabling and tic-lookalike patterns, and are usually triggered by the exposure to videos portraying tic-like behaviours on social media. Both pandemic-related FTLB and prepandemic FTLB are associated with high levels of depression and anxiety. FTLB related to the pandemic highlight the role of social media in the psychopathological behaviours of our time. We suggest FTLB are due to a combination of predisposing factors (high genetic and epigenetic risk for anxiety and depression, negative past experiences) and precipitating factors (pandemic and its impact on mental health, exposure to certain social media content). These factors of vulnerability may increase the risk of developing behavioural and emotional problems in youth, such as FTLB. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of psychiatric comorbidities seem to be predictors of positive prognosis.","Nilles, Pringsheim, Martino","https://doi.org/10.1097/WCO.0000000000001074","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33789,""
"The physical and mental health consequences of social isolation and loneliness in the context of COVID-19","Social isolation and loneliness are known contributors to all-cause mortality as well as a range of physical and mental health conditions. Therefore, this article reviews current literature pertaining to the effects of social isolation and loneliness on physical and mental health during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Social isolation and loneliness contribute to a myriad of physical and mental health conditions. Specifically social isolation and loneliness contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. However, most research indicated that poor lifestyle factors explained most of the association. Social isolation and loneliness are also associated with cognitive problems including dementia, immune system problems, and mental health conditions. Further social isolation and loneliness also spur behavioral issues that significantly affect physical and mental health. Evidence suggests that social isolation and loneliness have significant consequences on the physical and mental health of the individual and that the move toward ending all protections against COVID-19 has significant implications for the vulnerable. Further the similarities between the effects of social isolation and loneliness are compared to some of the conditions evident in long-COVID.","Pai, Vella","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000806","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33790,""
"Association between COVID-19 restrictions and emergency department presentations for paediatric mental health in Victoria, Australia","ObjectiveTo determine the association between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) restrictions and paediatric mental health emergency department presentations.MethodsSecondary analysis of Victorian Emergency Minimum Dataset data from 38 Victorian public hospital emergency departments. Paediatric patients (birth to &lt;18Ã¢â‚¬â€°years) attending emergency departments with an International Classification of Disease-Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM) diagnosis of a mental health problem between 1 January 2018 and 31 October 2020 were included. We compared pre-COVID-19 (1 January 2018-27 March 2020) to the COVID-19 period (28 March-26 October 2020) to examine the number of mental health presentations by patient age, socioeconomic status, location, and emergency department triage category. A Poisson regression prediction model was built for each diagnosis group to predict the presentation number in the COVID-19 period, assuming the pandemic and associated restrictions had not happened.ResultsThere were 15Ã¢â‚¬â€°898 presentations (589 presentations/month on average) in the pre-COVID-19 period and 4747 presentations (678 presentations/month on average) in the COVID-19 period. Compared with predicted presentations, there was an increase in observed presentations for eating disorders throughout lockdown (on average, an increase of 36 presentations/month) and for anxiety (11/month) and self-harm (18/month). There were no meaningful changes for mood disorders or developmental and behavioural problems, and presentations for substance abuse mostly fell.ConclusionsPandemic restrictions were associated with increased emergency department presentations for eating disorders and, to a lesser extent, anxiety and self-harm. Given the ongoing pandemic, clinicians and policy makers must work together to find timely, accessible solutions to better manage these conditions.","Hiscock, Chu, O'Reilly, Freed, White, Danchin, Craig","https://doi.org/10.1071/AH22015","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33791,""
"The Psychological Effects of the COVID-19 on Students Who Choose the Medical Profession With Different Motivational Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study","The COVID-19 pandemic has generated mental and psychological health problems worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine whether the psychological effects of COVID-19 were different in medical students who chose the medical profession with different motivational factors. In the study, there were 389 medical school students. The survey asks about sociodemographic features and the students' reasons for choosing the medical profession. The study also included a self-assessed Hospital Anxiety-Depression Scale and Beck Hopelessness Scale. While 41% of students chose the medical profession for economic reasons, the ratio of whom have an extrinsic and intrinsic source of motivation was 37% and 22%, respectively. It was found that there was a statistically significant difference in the distribution of motivational factors by gender. Almost 50% of males were affected by economic motivation factors. The difference in motivational factors between genders was found to be statistically significant. Anxiety in females, depression in students with low-income families, and hopelessness in students older than 22Ã¢â‚¬â€°years and interns were higher than in the others (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). Median scores for anxiety, depression, and hopelessness were higher for students with extrinsic motivational sources. However, only the difference in scores of anxiety and hopelessness was found statistically significant (<i>P</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.05). We found that the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic varied according to both sociodemographic characteristics of the medical students and reasons for choosing medical profession. According to our results, the idealistic students interested in the medical profession, who want to support others and prioritize economic benefits, had fewer psychological issues than those who chose the medical profession due to family pressure or external factors.","Terzi, Arslan, Midik, Dundar","https://doi.org/10.1177/00469580221109671","20220705","COVID-19; career choice; cross-sectional studies; medical professions; medical students; motivation; psychological effect","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33792,""
"Collective emotions during the COVID-19 outbreak","The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the world's population to unprecedented health threats and changes to social life. High uncertainty about the novel disease and its social and economic consequences, together with increasingly stringent governmental measures against the spread of the virus, likely elicited strong emotional responses. We analyzed the digital traces of emotional expressions in tweets during 5 weeks after the start of outbreaks in 18 countries and six different languages. We observed an early strong upsurge of anxiety-related terms in all countries, which was related to the growth in cases and increases in the stringency of governmental measures. Anxiety expression gradually relaxed once stringent measures were in place, possibly indicating that people were reassured. Sadness terms rose and anger terms decreased with or after an increase in the stringency of measures and remained stable as long as measures were in place. Positive emotion words only decreased slightly and briefly in a few countries. Our results reveal some of the most enduring changes in emotional expression observed in long periods of social media data. Such sustained emotional expression could indicate that interactions between users led to the emergence of collective emotions. Words that frequently occurred in tweets suggest a shift in topics of conversation across all emotions, from political ones in 2019, to pandemic related issues during the outbreak, including everyday life changes, other people, and health. This kind of time-sensitive analyses of large-scale samples of emotional expression have the potential to inform risk communication.

"Changes in the pattern of suicides and suicide attempt admissions in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic","The consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic for mental health remain unclear, especially regarding the effects on suicidal behaviors. To assess changes in the pattern of suicide attempt (SA) admissions and completed suicides (CS) in association with the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of a longitudinal study, SA admissions and CS are systematically documented and analyzed in all psychiatric hospitals in Frankfurt/Main (765.000 inhabitants). Number, sociodemographic factors, diagnoses and methods of SA and CS were compared between the periods of March-December 2019 and March-December 2020. The number of CS did not change, while the number of SA significantly decreased. Age, sex, occupational status, and psychiatric diagnoses did not change in SA, whereas the percentage of patients living alone while attempting suicide increased. The rate and number of intoxications as a SA method increased and more people attempted suicide in their own home, which was not observed in CS. Such a shift from public places to home is supported by the weekday of SA, as the rate of SA on weekends was significantly lower during the pandemic, likely because of lockdown measures. Only admissions to psychiatric hospitals were recorded, but not to other institutions. As it seems unlikely that the number of SA decreased while the number of CS remained unchanged, it is conceivable that the number of unreported SA cases increased during the pandemic. Our data suggest that a higher number of SA remained unnoticed during the pandemic because of their location and the use of methods associated with lower lethality.","Reif-Leonhard, Lemke, Holz, Ahrens, Fehr, Steffens, Grube, Freitag, KÃƒÂ¶lzer, Schlitt, Gebhardt, GÃƒÂ¤deke, Schmidt, Gerlach, Wolff, StÃƒÂ¤blein, Hauschild, Beig, Wagner, MÃƒÂ¼ller, Verhoff, Schlang, Reif","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00406-022-01448-y","20220705","COVID-19; Completed suicide; Pandemic; SARS-CoV2; Suicide attempt","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33794,""
"[Efficacy of tele-rehabilitation in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review]","The COVID-19 pandemic has required the use of new technologies to carry out rehabilitation sessions for COP D remotely. The aim of this systematic review was to analyse the available evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in COPD patients. PubMed, WOS, PEDro and Cochrane databases were consulted. The systematic review included nine clinical trials, 55.5% of which display good methodological quality. The most commonly used rehabilitation methods were applications or software for real-time video-calls, visualisation of exercises and recording progress.

"Pandemic Triggered Adoption of Telehealth in Underserved Communities: Examining Pre-and Post-Shutdown Trends","The adoption of telehealth services has been a challenge in rural communities. The reasons for the slow adoption of such technology-driven services have been attributed to social norms, healthcare policies, and a lack of infrastructure to support the delivery of services. However, the COVID-19 pandemic-related shutdown of in-person healthcare services resulted in the usage of telehealth services as a necessity rather than a choice. As services return to normalcy, it is important to examine if the usage of telehealth services during the period of a shutdown has changed any of the trends in the acceptance of telehealth as a reliable alternative to traditional in-person healthcare services. Our aim was to explore if the temporary shift to telehealth services has changed the attitudes towards the usage of technology-enabled health services in rural communities. The pandemic also fast-tracked some needed legislation to allow medical cost reimbursement for remote examination and healthcare services. An increase in the use of telehealth could help the local and federal governments address the shortage of healthcare facilities and service providers in underserved communities, and patients can get the much-needed care in a timely and effective manner. We examine the Medicaid reimbursement data for the state of Alabama from March 2019 through June 2021. Selecting the telehealth service codes, we explore the adoption rates in three phases of the COVID-19 shutdown, including pre-pandemic, pandemic before the rollout of the mass vaccination, and pandemic after the rollout of the mass vaccination. The trend of telemedicine claims has an opposite pattern of non-telemedicine claims across the three periods. The distribution of various characteristics of patients who have used telemedicine (age group, gender, race, level of rurality, and service provider type) are very different across the three periods. Claims related to behavior and mental health enjoyed the highest rates of telemedicine usage after the onset of the pandemic. The rate of telemedicine usage remained at a high level after the rollout of the mass vaccination. The current trends indicate that adoption of telehealth services is likely to increase post-Pandemic and that the consumers (patients), service providers, healthcare establishments, insurance companies, and state and local policies have changed their attitudes towards telehealth.","Xu, Hudnall, Zhao, Raja, Parton, Lewis","https://doi.org/10.2196/38602","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33796,""
"Addressing isolation, loneliness and mental health during COVID: A university training partnership with senior living communities","Older adults living in congregate housing have been uniquely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The sudden interruption of routine activities, social isolation, and support adversely affected the wellbeing of residents in retirement facilities around the country and world. The stress of social isolation was fueled by the interruption of routine activities and support that in turn, adversely affected the wellbeing, mood, and cognition of many residents. Therefore, university clinical programs in psychology and counseling can address the needs of community older residents by preparing student clinicians to work with the aging population and to engage in telehealth models of outreach and interventions. This manuscript outlines a model of partnership between long-term care assisted living organizations and clinical training programs at a west coast university to meet community and educational needs of older residents.","Sheperis, Gomez, Wathen, Frank, Brown","https://doi.org/10.1080/02701960.2022.2096602","20220705","Assisted living; COVID-19; clinical training; depression; isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33797,""
"Psychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19: A Literature Review","COVID19 (coronavirus disease of 2019) occurs due to the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It uses angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) as its primary receptor to enter the host cell. Recent reports suggest that this pathogen also has a large impact on the CNS alongside other organs. Various inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and numerous metabolites are poorly regulated during infection as well as in several psychiatric diseases, which leads to conditions of hypoxia and cytokine storm. The persistence of COVID-19 infection may also result in aggravation of the already present neuro-psychiatric symptoms in patients. We systematically searched various sources of journals and assessed the varied neurological routes of propagation and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 neurotoxicity like ACE2-mediated neuro-invasion induced hypoxia, and the cytokine storm syndrome. Several case studies were also referred to obtain a better idea of the current mental health scenario as a consequence of infection and inflammation due to SARS-CoV-2. Several risk factors for the causation of mental health issues during as well as after the infection include female gender, presence of necrosis, and pain in avascular regions. Most of the psychiatric disorders are directly associated with the socioeconomic and psychosocial changes that occurred as a consequence of the pandemic. These psychiatric manifestations have only started to unravel, which calls for the development of faster means of diagnosis and integrated pharmacological and epidemiological studies to curb the growing rate of neuronal complications as well as mortality.","Khatun, Tamilanban, Chitra","https://doi.org/10.2174/1871527321666220701152821","20220705","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; anxiety; biomarkers.; depression; diagnostic tools; inflammation; psychiatric disorders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33798,""
"Investigating mental health service user views of stigma on Twitter during COVID-19: a mixed-methods study","<b>Background:</b> Mental health stigma on social media is well studied, but not from the perspective of mental health service users. Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) increased mental health discussions and may have impacted stigma.<b>Objectives:</b> (1) to understand how service users perceive and define mental health stigma on social media; (2) how COVID-19 shaped mental health conversations and social media use.<b>Methods:</b> We collected 2,700 tweets related to seven mental health conditions: schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, autism, eating disorders, OCD, and addiction. Twenty-seven service users rated them as stigmatising or neutral, followed by focus group discussions. Focus group transcripts were thematically analysed.<b>Results:</b> Participants rated 1,101 tweets (40.8%) as stigmatising. Tweets related to schizophrenia were most frequently classed as stigmatising (411/534, 77%). Tweets related to depression or anxiety were least stigmatising (139/634, 21.9%). A stigmatising tweet depended on perceived intention and context but some words (e.g. ""psycho"") felt stigmatising irrespective of context.<b>Discussion:</b> The anonymity of social media seemingly increased stigma, but COVID-19 lockdowns improved mental health literacy. This is the first study to qualitatively investigate service users' views of stigma towards various mental health conditions on Twitter and we show stigma is common, particularly towards schizophrenia. Service user involvement is vital when designing solutions to stigma.","Jansli, Hudson, Negbenose, Erturk, Wykes, Jilka","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2091763","20220705","England; Twitter; co-production; mental health; patient and public involvement; social media; stigma","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33799,""

"Association of current income and reduction in income during the COVID-19 pandemic with anxiety and depression among non-healthcare workers","Many workers experienced income reduction during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which may link to adverse mental health. This study aimed to examine the association of current income and reduction in income during COVID-19 with anxiety and depression levels among non-healthcare workers. This is a multi-city cross-sectional study. We used standardized questionnaires to collect information. We regrouped the current income and income reduction during COVID-19 according to the tertile and median value of each specific city. Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales-21 item short version (DASS-21) was used to assess anxiety and depression levels. We performed multinomial logistic regression to examine the association of current and reduced income with anxiety and depression. Path models were developed to outline the potential modification/indirect effect of subsidies from government. Large income reduction and low current income were significantly associated with more anxiety/depression symptoms. Path analysis showed that government subsidies could not significantly alleviate the impact of reduced income on anxiety/depression. Our findings showed that large income reduction and low current income were independently associated with anxiety/depression, while these symptoms may not be ameliorated by one-off government funds.

"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student mental health and wellbeing in UK university students: a multiyear cross-sectional analysis","Ongoing concern for the unique mental health challenges faced by university students has been magnified by the disruption of the global COVID-19 pandemic since March 2020. This study aimed to investigate changes in mental health and wellbeing outcomes for UK university students since the pandemic began, and to examine whether more vulnerable groups were disproportionately impacted. Students at a UK university responded to anonymous online cross-sectional surveys in 2019 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2637), 2020 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3693), and 2021 (<i>N</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2772). Students completed measures of depression, anxiety and subjective wellbeing (SWB). Multivariable logistic regression models investigated associations of survey year and sociodemographic characteristics with mental health and SWB. Compared to 2019, fewer students showed high levels of depression and anxiety symptoms in 2020. However, there was evidence of worsened levels of anxiety and SWB in 2021 compared to 2019. Interaction effects indicated that students from a Black, Asian or minority ethnicity background and students previously diagnosed with a mental health difficulty showed improved outcomes in 2021 compared to previous years. There is a need for sector-wide strategies including preventative approaches, appropriate treatment options for students already experiencing difficulties and ongoing monitoring post-pandemic.","Bennett, Heron, Gunnell, Purdy, Linton","https://doi.org/10.1080/09638237.2022.2091766","20220705","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; mental health; pandemic; university student; wellbeing","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33802,""
"COVID-19: Factors Predicting Depressive Symptoms in People Aging With Long-Term Physical Disabilities","The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may be greater than that of the viral infection. This impact is likely greater for disadvantaged groups such as people with long-term physical disabilities (PwLTPD). This cross-sectional study used a multiple linear regression model to examine factors associated with depressive symptoms and to understand their relative importance during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The model explained 58% of the variance in depressive symptoms. Anxiety was the most important predictor, accounting for 8% of variance. Higher levels of anxiety, loneliness, and financial stress; prior diagnosis of depression; and non-Black race predicted a higher level of depressive symptoms in PwLTPD during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We aimed to evaluate the direct early psychological and behavioural signs related to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and related confinement on children and adolescents. Children and adolescents' drawings were collected for a limited time window (16th March-10th April 2020) and analyzed. Their parents were asked in the following month to answer a qualitative e-survey on somatic complaints and behavioral changes of the participating children/adolescents. Ninety-eight drawings by children/adolescents (mean age 7.01Ã‚Â±2.83 years) were analysed. Analyses of the 98 drawings reported signs of trauma in all (of them, 60.2% with moderate-to high levels). Children aged 3-5 years were more impacted, followed by preadolescents/adolescents aged 11-17 years. Parents reported somatic complaints in the 71.1% of their children/adolescents: the most frequent were increased appetite (35.6%), abdominal pain (20.0%) and headache (20.0%). Behavioral changes were observed in 77.8% of subjects: increased appetite (35.6%), abdominal pain (20.0%) and headache (20.0%) were more represented.

"Psychometric properties of the COVID-19 Pandemic Fatigue Scale: results from the online COSMO-Spain survey","Pandemic fatigue is defined as feelings of demotivation to follow preventive measures against COVID-19, together with decrease of trust in government and frequency of information seeking behavior. To analyze the psychometric properties of the COVID-19-specific pandemic fatigue scale according to classical test theory (CTT) and Rasch model approaches, in the Spanish general population. Cross-sectional study in a representative sample of 1018 adults that completed an online survey in November 2020 in the framework of the COVID-19 Snapshot MOnitoring (COSMO)-Spain project. The assessments included the 6-item COVID-19 Pandemic Fatigue Scale (CPFS) and other COVID-19 related variables: COVID-19 infection, adherence to preventive behaviors, information-seeking behavior, self-efficacy, worry and cognitive and affective risk perception. Data quality, acceptability, reliability and validity were analyzed according to CTT, and fit to the Rasch model, unidimensionality, appropriateness of the response scale, item local independency, reliability (person-separation index, PSI), and item-person distribution were also calculated. The mean CPFS score was 17.06 (standard deviation, SD: 5.04, range: 6-30), with higher scores in women, younger participants, participants who never seek information on COVID-19, those who think they would contract a mild disease in case of infection and those with higher level of worry about coronavirus/COVID-19, who felt depressed or felt the coronavirus/COVID-19 is spreading slowly (P&lt;0.01). CPFS Cronbach alpha was 0.74. In the confirmatory factor analysis, one factor was identified (RMSEA = .02; CFI = .99; Ãâ€¡2 (5) = 8.06, P = 0.153). The CPFS showed good fit to Rasch model (Ãâ€¡ 224=42.025, P=.0128, PSI = .642), unidimensionality (binomial 95% CI: -.005-.045), and item local independency.

"Inappropriate Ventilatory Homeostatic Responses in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients","The clinical presentation of COVID-19 suggests altered breathing control - tachypnoea, relative lack of dyspnoea, and often a discrepancy between severity of clinical and radiological findings. Few studies characterize and analyse the contribution of breathing drivers and their ventilatory and perceptual responses. To establish the prevalence of inappropriate ventilatory and perceptual response in COVID-19, by characterizing the relationships between respiratory rate (RR), dyspnoea and arterial blood gas (ABG) in a cohort of COVID-19 patients at presentation to hospital, and their post-Covid respiratory sequelae at follow-up. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including consecutive adult patients admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 between 1st March 2020 and 30th April 2020. In those with concurrent ABG, RR and documented dyspnoea status on presentation, we documented patient characteristics, disease severity, and outcomes at hospital and 6-week post-discharge. Of 492 admissions, 194 patients met the inclusion criteria. Tachypnoea was present in 75% pronounced (RR&gt;30) in 36%, and persisted during sleep. RR correlated with heart rate (HR) (r = 0.2674), temperature (r = 0.2824), CRP (r = 0.2561), Alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient (r = 0.4189), and lower PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> (PF) ratio (r = -0.3636). RR was not correlated with any neurological symptoms. Dyspnoea was correlated with RR (r = 0.2932), A-a gradient (r = 0.1723), and lower PF ratio (r = -0.1914), but not correlated with PaO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.1095), PaCO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.0598) or any recorded neurological symptom except for altered consciousness. Impaired ventilatory homeostatic control of pH/PaCO<sub>2</sub> [tachypnoea (RR&gt;20), hypocapnia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;4.6 kPa), and alkalosis (pH&gt;7.45)] was observed in 29%. This group, of which 37% reported no dyspnoea, had more severe respiratory disease (A-a gradient 38.9 vs. 12.4 mmHg; PF ratio 120 vs. 238), and higher prevalence of anosmia (21 vs. 15%), dysgeusia (25 vs. 12%), headache (33 vs. 23%) and nausea (33 vs. 14%) with similar rates of new anxiety/depression (26 vs. 23%), but lower incidence of past neurological or psychiatric diagnoses (5 vs. 21%) compared to appropriate responders. Only 5% had hypoxia sufficiently severe to drive breathing (i.e. PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;6.6 kPa). At 6 weeks post-discharge, 24% (8/34) showed a new breathing pattern disorder with no other neurological findings, nor previous respiratory, neurological, or psychiatric disorder diagnoses. Impaired homeostatic control of ventilation i.e., tachypnoea, despite hypocapnia to the point of alkalosis appears prevalent in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, a finding typically accompanying more severe disease. Tachypnoea prevalence was between 12 and 29%. Data suggest that excessive tachypnoea is driven by both peripheral and central mechanisms, but not hypoxia. Over a third of patients with impaired homeostatic ventilatory control did not experience dyspnoea despite tachypnoea. A subset of followed-up patients developed post-covid breathing pattern disorder.","Jareonsettasin, Zeicu, Diehl, Harper, Astin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2022.909915","20220705","COVID-19; breathing pattern disorder; dyspnea; impaired homeostasis; post-covid breathing pattern dysfunction; ventilation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33806,""
"Financial Burden and Mental Health Among LGBTQIA+ Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Survivors During the COVID-19 Pandemic","In the United States, the cost of cancer treatment can lead to severe financial burden for cancer survivors. The economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic compound cancer survivors' financial challenges. Financial burden may be particularly challenging for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, asexual and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQIA+) survivors. LGBTQIA+ survivors who are adolescent and young adults (AYA) may face elevated financial burden due to multiple, intersecting identities. An explanatory sequential mixed methods design was applied, beginning with a survey of AYA cancer survivors in the Mountain West region of the United States. Survey measures included demographics, COVID-19 impacts, the COmprehensive Score for financial Toxicity (COST), Perceived Stress Scale-4 (PSS-4), and PROMIS anxiety and depression scales. Two-way t-tests were used to analyze differences in outcomes between LGBTQIA+ and non-LGBTQIA+ AYAs. All LGBTQIA+ survey participants were invited to complete an interview, and those who agreed participated in descriptive interviews about financial burden due to cancer, COVID-19, and LGBTQIA+ identity. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Dedoose. Survey participants (N=325) were LGBTQIA+ (n=29, 8.9%), primarily female (n= 197, 60.6%), non-Hispanic White (n= 267, 82.2%), and received treatment during COVID-19 (n= 174, 54.0%). LGBTQIA+ interview participants (n=9, 100%) identified as a sexual minority and (n=2, 22.2%) identified as a gender minority. Most were non-Hispanic White (n=6, 66.7%) and had received treatment during COVID-19 (n=7, 77.8%). Statistical analyses revealed that LGBTQIA+ AYAs reported significantly worse COST scores than non-LGBTQIA+ AYAs (p=0.002). LGBTQIA+ AYAs also reported significantly higher PSS-4 (p=0.001), PROMIS anxiety (p=0.002) and depression scores (p&lt;0.001) than non-LGBTQIA+ AYAs, reflecting worse mental health outcomes. High costs of cancer treatment and employment disruptions due to COVID-19 contributed to substantial financial stress, which exacerbated existing mental health challenges and introduced new ones.

"Pathophysiological Changes in Erythrocytes Contributing to Complications of Inflammation and Coagulation in COVID-19","Higher thrombotic burden in the acute phase of COVID-19 relies on a complex interplay between pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release, increased endothelial dysfunction/damage, and potential sepsis-induced coagulopathy development in severe cases, all promoting coagulation activation. Plasma levels of cytokines and chemokines are known to be increased in COVID-19 however, are much higher in severe infections. Increased levels of IL-1ÃŽÂ², IL-6, and IL-8 are known to play an important role in both acute and chronic inflammation, resulting in pathological clotting. However, little has been published on the effects of these interleukins on red blood cells (RBCs). Evidence shows that cytokines have a negative effect on the RBCs ultrastructure and introduce signs of eryptosis. Eryptosis can be described as a form of suicidal death of RBCs characterized by distinct findings of cell shrinkage, membrane blebbing, activation of proteases, and phosphatidylserine exposure at the outer membrane leaflet. Red blood cells from COVID-19 patients had increased levels of glycolytic intermediates, accompanied by oxidation and fragmentation of ankyrin, spectrin beta, and the N-terminal cytosolic domain of band 3 (AE1). Significantly altered lipid metabolism was also observed, in particular, short- and medium-chain saturated fatty acids, acyl-carnitines, and sphingolipids. Emerging research suggests that RBCs may contribute to a precision medicine approach to sepsis and have diagnostic value in monitoring complement dysregulation in COVID-19-sepsis and non-COVID sepsis as research indicates that complement activation products and viral antigens are present on RBCs in patients with COVID-19.","Soma, Bester","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2022.899629","20220705","COVID-19; coagulopathy; cytokines; erythrocytes; precision medicine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33808,""
"Sigma-1 Receptors in Depression: Mechanism and Therapeutic Development","Depression is the most common type of neuropsychiatric illness and has increasingly become a major cause of disability. Unfortunately, the recent global pandemic of COVID-19 has dramatically increased the incidence of depression and has significantly increased the burden of mental health care worldwide. Since full remission of the clinical symptoms of depression has not been achieved with current treatments, there is a constant need to discover new compounds that meet the major clinical needs. Recently, the roles of sigma receptors, especially the sigma-1 receptor subtype, have attracted increasing attention as potential new targets and target-specific drugs due to their translocation property that produces a broad spectrum of biological functions. Even clinical first-line antidepressants with or without affinity for sigma-1 receptors have different pharmacological profiles. Thus, the regulatory role of sigma-1 receptors might be useful in treating these central nervous system (CNS) diseases. In addition, long-term mental stress disrupts the homeostasis in the CNS. In this review, we discuss the topical literature concerning sigma-1 receptor antidepressant mechanism of action in the regulation of intracellular proteostasis, calcium homeostasis and especially the dynamic Excitatory/Inhibitory (E/I) balance in the brain. Furthermore, based on these discoveries, we discuss sigma-1 receptor ligands with respect to their promise as targets for fast-onset action drugs in treating depression.","Ren, Wang, Li, Li, Ma, Zhao, Li","https://doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2022.925879","20220705","E/I balance; calcium; depression; proteostasis; sigma-1 receptors","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33809,""
"Food insecurity and symptoms of anxiety and depression disorder during the COVID- 19 pandemic: COVID-Inconfidentes, a population-based survey","This study aimed to investigate the association between adult food insecurity (FI) and symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) in two Brazilian cities during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. This study used data derived from a cross-sectional survey of 1693 adults. Interviews were conducted using an electronic questionnaire. The FI was measured using the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale. The Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 was used to measure the symptoms of GAD. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used for MDD symptoms. The association between FI, GAD, and MDD symptoms was investigated using a Poisson regression model with robust variance to estimate the prevalence ratio and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). In regression models, a linear association between FI levels and outcomes was observed, with severe food insecurity having a 3.56 higher prevalence of GAD symptoms (95% CI: 2.23, 5.68) and a 3.03 higher prevalence of MDD (95% CI: 1.55, 5.90). In the stratified analyses, worse results were observed for females and males, individuals with non-white race/skin color, those without children, and those with lower monthly family income. In conclusion, the FI was associated with symptoms of GAD and MDD, and the sociodemographic characteristics interfered in this association.

"Quality of Internet Videos Related to Pediatric Urology in Mainland China: A Cross-Sectional Study","Pediatric urological diseases pose serious threats to children's physical and mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in poor pediatric outcomes for cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and testicular torsion. Presently, many people tend to seek health information via social media platforms. This study aims to quantitatively assess the quality of videos as an information source for pediatric urology in mainland China. In this cross-sectional study, a search was performed on social media platforms (Tiktok, Bilibili, and Weibo) with the search terms ""cryptorchidism"", ""hypospadias"", and ""testicular torsion"". The first 30 results with any search term listed by relevance were selected in each platform. Video features (duration, number of likes, comments, and shares) and video sources were collected. Each video included in the study was assessed using DISCERN, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Benchmark Criteria, and Hexagonal Radar Schema. A correlation analysis was performed considering video features, video source, DISCERN scores and JAMA scores. A total of 152 videos were included and analyzed. The majority of videos were from physicians (65.8%). According to the DISCERN classification, most videos were rated as ""very poor"" (48.0%) and ""poor"" (36.8%). The mean DISCERN and JAMA scores were 36.56 and 2.68, respectively. The duration of videos uploaded by physicians was the shortest (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). The video source had no relevance to numbers of ""likes"", ""comments"", ""shares"", DISCERN scores, and JAMA scores (all <i>P</i>-values &gt; 0.05). Other than video duration (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001), there was no statistically significant difference between groups for any of the recorded or calculated video data (all <i>P</i> values &gt; 0.05). Hexagonal Radar Charts showed the severe imbalance and deficiency of video information. In general, Tiktok videos with the shortest duration received the most numbers of ""likes"", ""comments"", and ""shares"", whereas the overall quality of videos on Weibo was relatively high. Despite most of the videos on social media platforms being uploaded by medical authors, the overall quality was poor. The misleading, inaccurate and incomplete information may pose a health risk to the viewers, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Much effort needs to be undertaken to improve the quality of health-related videos regarding pediatric urology.","Bai, Fu, Fu, Liu","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.924748","20220705","COVID-19; Chinese video; internet; pediatric urology; quality","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33811,""
"Self-Reported Anxiety in Spain: A Gendered Approach One Year After the Start of COVID-19 Pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on mental health. However, there is little evidence on how different axes of social inequity influence mental health from a gender perspective and over time. Our aim is to analyze anxiety according to gender identity and other axes of social inequities (migration status, sexual orientation, age, and employment conditions) one year after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. We conducted a cross-sectional study among adults living in Spain with an online survey from April 8 to May 28, 2021. The main variable was anxiety measured by Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7). Sex-stratified multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to assess the association between axes of inequities and anxiety. Our findings (<i>N</i> = 2,053) suggest that women have greater anxiety risk than men (35.2 vs. 28.2%, respectively). We observe in both genders that there is a clear age gradient, with anxiety decreasing as age increases; and that there is an association between worsening employment status and anxiety risk, although there is a difference between women by education level. Additionally, not having Spanish nationality is also associated with greater anxiety risk in women. In men, identifying as non-heterosexual is associated with a higher risk of anxiety. The axes of inequities have different effects according to gender identity. These differences in anxiety risk by population subgroup must be taken into account in order to sensibly and equitably treat the surge in mental health disorders brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Jacques-AviÃƒÂ±ÃƒÂ³, LÃƒÂ³pez-JimÃƒÂ©nez, Bennett, Medina-Perucha, LeÃƒÂ³n-GÃƒÂ³mez, Berenguera","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2022.873891","20220705","COVID-19; anxiety; gender; health inequities; immigrants; mental health; pandemic; sexual orientation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33812,""

A multi-check approach assembled all data and discussions. The study found that the use of personnel dynamic tracking systems or measures, combined with sodium hypochlorite and repeated filtration to stabilize water quality, could maintain the confidence of most medical workers in the swimming pool sports environment for epidemic prevention and avoid violations. The government could formulate safety prevention and control mechanisms in traffic and establish appropriate traffic routes. Next, formulated a prescription for swimming or other physical activity mechanisms for men aged 31-50 and redesigned measures for medical staff over 51 years old to have tense head issues and physical fatigue, promote blood circulation and improve sleep quality.

"Mental Health Help-Seeking in Parents and Trajectories of Depressive and Anxiety Symptoms: Lessons Learned From the Ontario Parent Survey During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Tracking parents' mental health symptoms and understanding barriers to seeking professional help are critical for determining policies and services to support families' well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed enormous challenges to parents' mental health and the access to professional help, and there are important public health lessons that must be learned from the past 2 years' experiences to inform future mental health responses to social- and family-level stressful events. This study examines the trajectories of parents' depressive and anxiety symptoms over a year during the pandemic as related to their mental health help-seeking. Data were collected from a sample of parents residing in Ontario, Canada at baseline (May-June, 2020; Wave 1) and again 1Ã¢â‚¬â€°year later (Wave 2; referred to as W1 and W2 below). Parents (<i>n</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2,439; <i>M</i> <sub>age</sub>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°39.47, <i>SD</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°6.65; 95.0% females) reported their depressive and anxiety symptoms at both waves. Mental health help-seeking, including self-reported contact with professional help and perceived unmet mental health needs, was measured at W2. Parents were classified into four groups by mental health help-seeking. <i>Inconsistent seekers</i> and <i>non-seeking needers</i>, both reporting perceived unmet needs for professional help, showed greater increases in depressive and anxiety symptoms, whereas parents with <i>no need</i> or <i>needs met</i> showed smaller increases in depressive symptoms and decreases in anxiety symptoms. Belief in self-reliance and time constraints were the leading reasons for not seeking help. These findings suggest that over a year into the pandemic, parents with perceived unmet mental health needs were at greater risk for worsening depressive and anxiety symptoms. Recognizing the demands for mental health services when families experience chronic stressors and targeting the identified barriers may promote family well-being during and beyond this pandemic.","Zhang, Jambon, Afifi, Atkinson, Bennett, Duku, Duncan, Joshi, Kimber, MacMillan, Gonzalez","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.884591","20220705","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; help-seeking; mental health; parent","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33814,""
"COVID-19 and Quitting Jobs","Despite substantial studies on COVID-19 and the problems employees face, the association between COVID-19 and resigning jobs has not caught the interest of researchers. Millions have already resigned from their employment, and more are expected to resign. This study aims to investigate the relationship between the demographics of employees, the course of COVID-19, perceived effect of COVID-19 on life (PEoC), fear, entrapment feeling, depression, and quitting the job during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was designed, and a convenient sampling method was adopted. Data were collected <i>via</i> an online questionnaire and analyzed by using SPSS version 26. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to reveal the relationship. Coefficients and significance values were used to interpret the results. Independent samples t-test and one-way ANOVA are used to determine the difference across the groups. The correlation between depression and work location is statistically significant. The PEoC increases fear, internal and external entrapment, and depression. Despite the statistically significant correlations between quitting jobs and the education level, internal and external entrapment, PEoC, fear, and depression for employees who have COVID-19 history, quitting the job was found to be affected only by COVID-19 history, internal entrapment feeling, and education level. This study has shown that quitting the job is associated with PEoC, depression, and internal and external entrapments. The correlation between quitting jobs and other conditions differs depending on the COVID-19 history of the employee. Furthermore, quitting the job is being affected by the coronavirus history, the internal entrapment, and education level.","Demirkaya, Aslan, GÃƒÂ¼ngÃƒÂ¶r, Durmaz, Rodoplu Ã…Å¾ahin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.916222","20220705","COVID-19; depression; feeling of entrapment; great resignation; quitting job","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33815,""
"Self-Care and Mental Health Among College Students During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Social and Physical Environment Features of Interactions Which Impact Meaningfulness and Mitigate Loneliness","The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted patterns and limited opportunities for social interaction, which increased already high loneliness rates among college students. Meaningful social interactions can mitigate negative mental health outcomes such as loneliness and bolster social support, which is in turn linked to better self-care practices. Social connection can aid in self-care through social support as well as be considered a self-care practice itself to counter the negative effects of loneliness. This study examined the social interaction patterns of 132 college students from a mid-sized United States university during the pandemic to understand which characteristics support meaningful interactions. Students completed an online survey from October through December 2020 to report details of their 2020 and 2019 social interactions, as well as their most recent interactions, including time spent, the mode (in-person versus virtual), their relationship to others in the interaction, the type of activity and privacy of the setting. Results found that students spent significantly less time interacting with non-roommates in-person in 2020, and more time in voice and video calls. No differences were found for texting and in-person roommate interactions. Meaningfulness was significantly higher for interactions with family or friends. Students reported the highest meaning for interactions that were planned and in-person, with lowest meaning for planned virtual interactions. No differences were observed for meaningfulness based on the type of interaction activity or privacy of the setting. Understanding the characteristics of the most meaningful interactions can help college students prioritize social interactions that may best promote self-care, mitigate loneliness, and bolster social support. High meaningfulness scores for planned in-person interactions suggests that these types of interactions may be most valuable for maintaining existing self-care patterns, engaging in self-care activities, and receiving support. Self-care activities for college students, including social interactions, were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have further exacerbated loneliness. College students should be encouraged to consciously engage in person with family and friends to practice self-care and maintain or improve mental health. Strategically selecting interactions that will optimize meaningfulness may therefore be critical to helping students to maintain positive mental health during and beyond the pandemic.","Barankevich, Loebach","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.879408","20220705","COVID-19 pandemic; college students; loneliness; mental health; physical environment; self-care; social interaction; virtual interactions","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33816,""
"Impact of Music Education on Mental Health of Higher Education Students: Moderating Role of Emotional Intelligence","Music education is one of human kind most universal forms of expression and communication, and it can be found in the daily lives of people of all ages and cultures all over the world. As university life is a time when students are exposed to a great deal of stress, it can have a negative impact on their mental health. Therefore, it is critical to intervene at this stage in their life so that they are prepared to deal with the pressures they will face in the future. The aim of this study was to see how music education affects university students' mental health, with emotional intelligence functioning as a moderator. The participants in this research were graduate students pursuing degrees in music education. Non probability convenience sampling technique was used to collect and evaluate the data from 265 students studying in different public and private Chinese universities. The data was gathered at a time, and therefore, the study is cross-sectional. The data was collected from January 2022 till the end of March 2022. Many universities have been closed because to COVID-19, therefore data was also gathered online through emails. The data was analyzed quantitatively using the partial least squares (PLS)-structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. The findings backed up the hypotheses. The results revealed that there is a significant effect of music education on student's mental health. Also, emotional intelligence as a moderator significantly and positively moderates the relationship between music education and students' mental health. Music has numerous physiological aspects, and listening to it on a daily basis may be beneficial to your general health and well-being. Furthermore, musicians and music students with a high level of emotional intelligence have a better chance of not just performing well in school, college and university or in the music industry, but also of maintaining mental health and improving it.","Wang, Huang, Zeb, Liu, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.938090","20220705","China; emotional intelligence; higher education students; mental health; music education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33817,""
"Deep-seated psychological histories of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance and resistance","To design effective pro-vaccination messaging, it is important to know ""where people are coming from""-the personal experiences and long-standing values, motives, lifestyles, preferences, emotional tendencies, and information-processing capacities of people who end up resistant or hesitant toward vaccination. We used prospective data from a 5-decade cohort study spanning childhood to midlife to construct comprehensive early-life psychological histories of groups who differed in their vaccine intentions in months just before COVID vaccines became available in their country. Vaccine-resistant and vaccine-hesitant participants had histories of adverse childhood experiences that foster mistrust, longstanding mental-health problems that foster misinterpretation of messaging, and early-emerging personality traits including tendencies toward extreme negative emotions, shutting down mentally under stress, nonconformism, and fatalism about health. Many vaccine-resistant and -hesitant participants had cognitive difficulties in comprehending health information. Findings held after control for socioeconomic origins. Vaccine intentions are not short-term isolated misunderstandings. They are part of a person's style of interpreting information and making decisions that is laid down before secondary school age. Findings suggest ways to tailor vaccine messaging for hesitant and resistant groups. To prepare for future pandemics, education about viruses and vaccines before or during secondary schooling could reduce citizens' level of uncertainty during a pandemic, and provide people with pre-existing knowledge frameworks that prevent extreme emotional distress reactions and enhance receptivity to health messages. Enhanced medical technology and economic resilience are important for pandemic preparedness, but a prepared public who understands the need to mask, social distance, and vaccinate will also be important.","Moffitt, Caspi, Ambler, Bourassa, Harrington, Hogan, Houts, Ramrakha, Wood, Poulton","https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac034","20220705","COVID-19; Vaccine resistance; health education; health policy; vaccine hesitance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33818,""

"Examining COVID-19 related occupational stress in teachers in Ireland through a qualitative study using a thematic analysis approach","The teaching profession was dramatically affected by COVID-19 with school closures and ultimately the move to online learning. COVID-19 brought additional stress to an already demanding profession with the introduction of online teaching, teachers experiencing fear of infection and additional workloads accompanying the pandemic. To examine COVID-19 related occupational stress in teachers in Ireland through a qualitative study using a thematic analysis approach. This study implemented two recruitment strategies for participants; email invitations to all members of ILSA and INTO, and email invitations with study information to school principals. A study specific questionnaire was devised with three questions offering free text responses. All responses were anonymous and analysed collectively. The Braun and Clarke thematic analysis method was employed to analyse participants' responses. 224 participants responded to the survey, however not all participants completed all three questions. Initially 98 codes were generated from the data set, and subsequently reduced to 41 final codes. The codes were arranged into three final themes; Overburdened, Abandoned, and Consequences, representing occupational stress in teachers during COVID-19. In the form of the three themes identified, participants described issues such as large class sizes, high workload, and out of work hours contact, among others. These issues contributed negatively to participants' mental health and wellbeing with descriptions of being exhausted, isolated, stressed and experiencing burnout. Ensuring adequate awareness of, and paying attention to, teacher wellbeing is essential, such that optimisation of school environment can occur in light of additional burden associated with COVID-19.","Minihan, Begley, Martin, Dunleavy, Gavin, McNicholas","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijedro.2022.100183","20220705","Burnout; COVID-19; Education; Mental health; Occupational stress; Teachers","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33820,""
"COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in Israel Immediately Before the Vaccine Operation","The development of a vaccine for COVID-19 presented hope for a way out of the global crisis caused by the virus. However, a potential barrier may be vaccine hesitancy, and identifying the factors that affect it is critical, especially concerning a new vaccine technology. The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that effects vaccine hesitancy by using a holistic view. The data were collected from 504 people in December 2020, 3 days before the vaccine operation started in Israel. The analysis included three categories of determinants: (1) contextual influences; (2) health records; and (3) perceived health attitudes. The results indicate that different sets of variables affect willingness to accept the vaccine among the whole spectrum of the vaccine-hesitant and the undecided subsample. In the full sample, gender, age, income, influenza vaccine, perceived trust, perceived susceptibility, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers affected vaccine acceptance. The perceived level of suffering from COVID-19 was associated with willingness to vaccinate, and when religious beliefs increased, the intention to vaccinate decreased. For the undecided subsample, the factors included gender, influenza vaccine, trust in the vaccine company, and perceived vaccine benefits and barriers. The results suggest that efforts of governments and health institutions should focus on women and highlight the vaccine as an opportunity to ""go back to normal"" without worries. Those results will help implement vaccine strategy in the following cases: if infant vaccination is pursued and if emergency vaccines or new vaccine technologies emerge for another pandemic as well.","Teitler-Regev, Hon-Snir","https://www.google.com/search?q=COVID-19+Vaccine+Hesitancy+in+Israel+Immediately+Before+the+Vaccine+Operation.","20220705","COVID-19; Demographic; Health Belief Model; Influenza Vaccine; Vaccine Hesitancy","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33821,""
"Clinical Aspects of Manic Episodes After SARS-CoV-2 Contagion or COVID-19","As COVID-19 pandemic spread all over the world, it brought serious health consequences in every medical field, including mental health. Not only healthcare professionals were more prone to develop anxiety, depression, and stress, but the general population suffered as well. Some of those who had no prior history of a psychiatric disease developed peculiar symptoms following infection with SARS-CoV-2, mostly because of psychological and social issues triggered by the pandemic. People developed traumatic memories, and hypochondria, probably triggered by social isolation and stress. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 has influenced the mental health of psychiatric patients as well, exacerbating prior psychiatric conditions. In this review, we focus on analyzing those cases of mania in the context of bipolar disorder (BD) reported after COVID-19 disease, both in people with no prior psychiatric history and in psychiatric patients who suffered an exacerbation of the disease. Results have shown that COVID-19 may trigger a pre-existing BD or unmask an unknown BD, due to social and psychological influences (decreased social interaction, change in sleep patterns) and through biological pathways both (neuroinflammation and neuroinvasion through ACE-2 receptors expressed in the peripheral and central nervous systems (PNS and CNS respectively). No direct correlation was found between the severity of COVID-19 disease and manic symptoms. All cases presenting severe symptoms of both diseases needed specific medical treatment, meaning that they concur but are separate in the treatment strategy needed. This review highlights the importance of a now widespread viral disease as a potential agent unmasking and exacerbating bipolar mood disorder, and it can hopefully help physicians in establishing a rapid diagnosis and treatment, and pave the road for future research on neuroinflammation triggered by SARS-CoV-2.","Del Casale, Modesti, Rapisarda, Girardi, Tambelli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.926084","20220705","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; bipolar disorder; manic episode; neuroinflammation; neuroinvasion","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33822,""
"Anxiety, Stress and Depression in COVID-19 Survivors From an Italian Cohort of Hospitalized Patients: Results From a 1-Year Follow-Up","Mental health-related symptoms can persist over time beyond the most common respiratory clinical features of COVID-19. A recent meta-analysis underlined that mental health sequalae may be relevant for COVID-19 survivors and reported the following prevalence rates: 20% for post-traumatic stress disorder, 22% for anxiety, 36% for psychological distress, and 21% for depression. In the context of a multi-disciplinary follow-up project, we already investigated the mid-term (4 months) psychiatric outcomes in a sample of COVID-19 survivors. Patients were re-assessed after 1-year since hospital discharge. Follow-up conducted after 1 year involved 196 individuals recovered from COVID-19. Patients were assessed with a multi-disciplinary approach; including both a clinical interview performed by an experienced psychiatrist, trained in the use of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) to assess the presence of anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms and the following self-administered questionnaires: Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Resilience Scale for Adults, Impact of Event Scale, and COVID-19 Peritraumatic Distress Index (CPDI). Anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001) and depressive (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0003) symptoms registered at the clinical interview showed a significant improvement from the 4 to 12-months follow-up. Logistic regression model showed that female gender (<i>p</i> = 0.006), arterial hypertension (<i>p</i> = 0.01), obesity (0.04), anxiety (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.0001), and depressive (<i>p</i> = 0.02) symptoms at 4-months follow-up were associated with persistence of anxiety symptoms at 12 months. At logistic regression analysis female gender (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and depressive symptoms at 4-months follow-up (<i>p</i> = 0.01) were associated with depressive symptoms after 12 months. Severity of the disease in the acute phase, in this study, was not a determining factor in identifying subjects at risk of developing clinically relevant anxiety and depression as a consequence of COVID-19 disease. Findings from the logistic regressions suggest that the factors most affecting depression and anxiety in COVID survivors after 12 months were female gender, the presence of anxiety and depression after 4 months and some physical symptoms, not necessarily COVID-related. Impact of infection and consequent hospitalization for COVID-19 did no longer represent a relevant issue for depressive symptoms, compared to other general factors.","Gramaglia, Gattoni, Gambaro, Bellan, Balbo, Baricich, Sainaghi, Pirisi, Binda, Feggi, Jona, Marangon, Prosperini, Zeppegno","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.862651","20220705","COVID-19; anxiety; depression; distress; psychiatrics sequelae","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33823,""
"Prelicensure Nursing Students' Reflections on Institutional Response to the 2020 COVID-19 Crisis","The study aimed to describe how prelicensure student nurses perceive academic support and their institutions' response during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis. The shift to online learning caused by the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted every aspect of higher education, including pre-licensure nursing students. Prelicensure nursing education is one of the most stressful programs in higher education. In a period of great uncertainty, it becomes essential to explore how prelicensure nursing students perceive academic support from their institutions. A qualitative descriptive design was employed for the study. Thematic analysis was used to analyze data obtained from 16 semi-structured interviews. Six themes resulted from the data: Disorganization leading to chaos; technology and technical challenges; stress and frustration; am I prepared to be a nurse?; not having money; mental health matters. This study validates the experiences of nursing students. Students' obstacles during the pandemic should be identified and mitigated to promote learning and academic success.","Iheduru-Anderson, Foley","https://doi.org/10.1177/23333936221106793","20220705","COVID-19 pandemic; Northeastern USA; academic support; higher education; online learning; prelicensure student nurses","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33824,""
"Training in the detection of psychological distress on board ships through health simulation during the COVID-19 epidemic","An innovative medical simulation course was offered to seafarers during their statutory medical education refresher course. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, they experienced difficulties dealing with mariners' mental health problems. One hundred and fifty-three seafarers underwent training at the C3S medical training centre in Lorient Hospital. At the end of the module they were asked to fill in a questionnaire. Ninety-seven per cent of them were satisfied with their training. They felt that their training had given them confidence to deal with these problems when returning to sea. On this occasion, we tested their feelings on the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on board and compared their answers with the data available in our telemedical assistance service (TMAS) and in the literature.

"Telehealth treatment for gambling disorder in the COVID-19 era: seismic shifts and silver linings","Gambling disorder is a serious mental health condition and the only behavioral addiction currently recognized by the American Psychiatric Association. Though prevalence and treatment seeking for gambling disorder have been stable for decades, the global COVID-19 pandemic has created a seismic shift in societal factors that influence gambling disorder and treatment availability. At the same time, the increasing availability of telehealth therapy for gambling disorder offers a new way to provide specialized treatment nationwide. The present review discusses the seismic shifts in underlying risk factors, gambling availability, and reduced access to treatment. It also covers the emergence of telehealth treatment for gambling disorder, including its benefits and pitfalls. In separate commentaries, several experts hypothesized that the pandemic was likely to increase mental health risk factors in society such as social isolation, job loss, and stress. In addition, access to online gambling also increased, while countries that locked down more strictly (like Singapore) saw a reduction in terrestrial gambling, countries that did not lock down strictly (like Sweden) did not see changes in gambling behavior. Telehealth was almost universally recommended as a good option for treatment in the studies we reviewed, though proper training and staffing are needed for telehealth to prove effective. Gambling disorder was only included in nationwide addiction telehealth programs in two countries.","Smith, Jones, Lucia","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000799","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33826,""
"Investigating the relationship of COVID-19 related stress and media consumption with schizotypy, depression, and anxiety in cross-sectional surveys repeated throughout the pandemic in Germany and the UK","Studies report a strong impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related stressors on the mental well-being of the general population. In this paper, we investigated whether COVID-19 related concerns and social adversity affected schizotypal traits, anxiety, and depression using structural equational modelling. In mediation analyses, we furthermore explored whether these associations were mediated by healthy (sleep and physical exercise) or unhealthy behaviours (drug and alcohol consumption, excessive media use). We assessed schizotypy, depression, and anxiety as well as healthy and unhealthy behaviours and a wide range of sociodemographic scores using online surveys from residents of Germany and the United Kingdom over 1 year during the COVID-19 pandemic. Four independent samples were collected (April/May 2020: N=781, September/October 2020: N=498, January/February 2021: N=544, May 2021: N=486). The degree of schizotypy was measured using the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ), anxiety, and depression symptoms were surveyed with the Symptom Checklist (SCL-27), and healthy and unhealthy behaviours were assessed with the Coronavirus Health Impact Survey (CRISIS). Structural equation models were used to consider the influence of COVID-19 related concerns and social adversity on depressive and anxiety-related symptoms and schizotypal traits in relation to certain healthy (sleep and exercise) and unhealthy behaviours (alcohol and drug consumption, excessive media use). The results revealed that COVID-19 related life concerns were significantly associated with schizotypy in the September/October 2020 and May 2021 surveys, with anxiety in the September/October 2020, January/February 2021, and May 2021 surveys, and with depressive symptoms in all surveys. Social adversity significantly affected the expression of schizotypal traits and depressive and anxiety symptoms in all four surveys. Importantly, we found that excessive media consumption (&gt;4 hr per day) fully mediated the relationship between COVID-19 related life concerns and schizotypal traits in the January/February 2021 survey. Furthermore, several of the surveys showed that excessive media consumption was associated with increased depressive and anxiety-related symptoms in people burdened by COVID-19 related life. The ongoing uncertainties of the pandemic and the restrictions on social life have a strong impact on mental well-being and especially the expression of schizotypal traits. The negative impact is further boosted by excessive media consumption, which is especially critical for people with high schizotypal traits. FK received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 (Grant number 754,462). SN received funding from the Cundill Centre for Child and Youth Depression at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada and the Wellcome Trust Institutional Strategic Support Fund from the University of Cambridge. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, and the measures different governments took to contain it, harmed many peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mental well-being. The restrictions, combined with pandemic-related uncertainty, caused many individuals to experience increased stress, depression, and anxiety. Many people turned to unhealthy behaviours to cope, including consuming more alcohol or drugs, using media excessively, developing poor sleeping habits, or reducing the amount of exercise they did. Stress, drugs, poor sleep, and uncertainty can increase an individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s risk of developing psychotic symptoms, including delusions, hallucinations, or difficulty thinking clearly. These symptoms may be temporary or part of a more lasting condition, like schizophrenia. The risk of developing these symptoms increases in people with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœschizotypal traitsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, such as a lack of close relationships, paranoia, or unusual or implausible beliefs. These individuals may be especially vulnerable to the harmful mental health effects of the pandemic. Daimer et al. demonstrated that people who were more worried about their life stability or financial situation during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic had worse mental well-being than those who felt secure. In the experiments, volunteers completed a series of online mental health questionnaires at four different time points during the pandemic. People who reported feeling lonely, having negative thoughts, or experiencing fewer positive social interactions had more symptoms of mental illness. People who experienced more life disruptions also reported more anxiety or depression symptoms and more schizotypal traits. Daily consumption of at least four hours of digital media exacerbated negative mental health symptoms, and people with more pandemic-related life concerns also spent more time on digital media Daimer et al. suggest that increased media consumption among people with pandemic-related hardships may have increased mental health symptoms and schizotypal traits in these individuals. The survey results suggest that maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including meaningful relationships, is essential to staying mentally healthy during extreme situations like a global pandemic. Protective interventions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ such as strengthening social support networks, providing mental health education, or increasing mental healthcare provisions Ã¢â‚¬â€œ are essential to prevent poor mental health outcomes during future crises.","Daimer, Mihatsch, Neufeld, Murray, Knolle","https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75893","20220705","COVID-19; Schizotypy; epidemiology; global health; human; media consumption; medicine; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33827,""
"Dual public health crises: the overlap of drug overdose and firearm injury in Indianapolis, Indiana, 2018-2020","Drug overdose and firearm injury are two of the United States (US) most unrelenting public health crises, both of which have been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. Programs and policies typically focus on each epidemic, alone, which may produce less efficient interventions if overlap does exist. The objective is to examine whether drug overdose correlates with and is associated with firearm injury at the census tract level while controlling for neighborhood characteristics. An ecological study of census tracts in Indianapolis, Indiana from 2018 to 2020. Population rates per 100,000 and census tracts with the highest overlap of overdose and firearm injury were identified based on spatial clusters. Bivariate association between census tract characteristic and drug overdose and firearm violence rate within spatial clusters. Zero-inflated negative binominal regression was used to estimate if the drug overdose activity is associated with higher future firearm injury. In high overdose-high firearm injury census tracts, rates of firearm injury and drug overdose are two times higher compared to city wide rates. Indicators of structural disadvantage and structural racism are higher in high overdose-high firearm injury census tracts compared to city-wide averages. Drug overdoses are associated with higher rates of firearm injury in the following year (IRR: 1.004, 95% CI 1.001, 1.007, pÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.05), adjusting for census tract characteristics and spatial dependence. Drug overdose and firearm injury co-spatially concentrate within census tracts. Moreover, drug overdoses are associated with future firearm injury. Interventions to reduce firearm injuries and drug overdoses should be a co-response in high drug overdose-high firearm injury communities.","Magee, Ray, Huynh, O'Donnell, Ranney","https://doi.org/10.1186/s40621-022-00383-9","20220705","Drug overdose; Firearm injuries; Neighborhoods; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33828,""
"[Impact of COVID-19 on long term care: the case of residential facilities SESPAS Report 2022]","Facilities have been the focus of the greatest impact of COVID-19 in terms of mortality and extreme situations, along with health centers. The main objective of this article is to describe how the arrival of SARS-CoV-2 affected facilities, focusing on Spain during the first pandemic months, and to point out lessons learned. Despite the measures and regulations approved in the first weeks of March 2020, these centers were not prepared for the arrival of an epidemic such as the one experienced. The clearest indicator of this is a strong impact on mortality in residential facilities. The excess of deaths in residences has been estimated at 26,448 people between March 2020 and May 2021 (10.6% of the total number of dependents cared for in residences, with an excess mortality of 43.5%), with deaths concentrated in the first months of the pandemic. However, there are other effects to be considered such as those that affect the mental health and quality of life of residents, family members, and residential facilities staff. Assuming that no two pandemics are possibly alike, it is essential to draw lessons from lived experience that may be useful to prepare for similar future situations and strengthen a long-term care system that was already frail before the arrival of SARS-CoV-2.","Oliva, PeÃƒÂ±a Longobardo","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2022.02.003","20220705","COVID-19; Cuidados de larga duraciÃƒÂ³n; Long-term care; Pandemia; Pandemic; Residencias; Residential facilities","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33829,""

"[What have we missed because of COVID-19? Missed diagnoses and delayed follow-ups SESPAS Report 2022]","The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated public health emergency have affected patients and health services in non-COVID-19 pathologies. Several studies have shown its dissociation from health services, with a decrease in emergency department visits, in hospital admissions for non-COVID-19 pathologies, as well as in the reported weekly incidence of acute illnesses and new diagnoses in primary care. In parallel, the pandemic has had direct and indirect effects on people with chronic diseases; the difficulties in accessing health services, the interruption of care, the saturation of the system itself and its reorientation towards non-face-to-face formats has reduced the capacity to prevent or control chronic diseases. All this has also had an impact on the different areas of people's lives, creating new social and economic difficulties, or aggravating those that existed before the pandemic. All these circumstances have changed with each epidemic wave. We present a review of the most relevant studies that have been analyzing this problem and incorporate as a case study the results of a retrospective observational study carried out in Primary Care in the Madrid Health Service, which provides health coverage to a population of more than 6 million people, and whose objective was to analyze the loss of new diagnoses in the most prevalent pathologies such as common mental health problems, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and breast and colon tumors, in the first and second waves. Annual incidence rates with their confidence interval were calculated for each pathology and the monthly frequency of new codes recorded between 1/01/2020 and 12/31/2020 was compared with the monthly mean of observed counts for the same months between 2016 and 2019. The annual incidence rate for all processes studied decreased in 2020 except for anxiety disorders. Regarding the recovery of lost diagnoses, heart failure is the only diagnosis showing an above-average recovery after the first wave. To return to pre-pandemic levels of diagnosis and follow-up of non-COVID-19 pathology, the healthcare system must reorganize and contemplate specific actions for the groups at highest risk.","Del Cura-GonzÃƒÂ¡lez, Polentinos-Castro, FontÃƒÂ¡n-Vela, LÃƒÂ³pez-RodrÃƒÂ­guez, MartÃƒÂ­n-FernÃƒÂ¡ndez","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaceta.2022.03.003","20220705","AtenciÃƒÂ³n primaria; COVID-19; Chronic diseases; DiagnÃƒÂ³sticos perdidos; Enfermedades crÃƒÂ³nicas; Follow-up; Health services; Missed diagnoses; Primary health care; SARS-CoV-2; Seguimientos; Servicios de salud","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33831,""
"Network analysis of comorbid depression and anxiety and their association with quality of life among clinicians in public hospitals during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic in China","Mental health problems are common among clinicians working in public hospitals even in the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Network analysis is a novel approach to explore interactions between mental health problems at the symptom level. This study examined the network structure of comorbid depression and anxiety and their association with quality of life (QOL) among hospital clinicians in China during the late stage of the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 5230 participants were recruited from October 13 to 22, 2020. The nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF) were used to measure depressive and anxiety symptoms, and QOL, respectively. Central and bridge symptoms were identified with centrality and bridge centrality indices, respectively. Network stability was examined using the case-dropping procedure. The prevalence of depression (defined as PHQ-9 total scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯5) was 35.1Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% [95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% confidence interval (CI)Ã¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯33.73-36.41Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%)], the prevalence of anxiety (GAD-7 total scoreÃ¢â‚¬Â¯Ã¢â€°Â¥Ã¢â‚¬Â¯5) was 32.5Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯31.20-33.84Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%), while the prevalence of comorbid depression and anxiety was 26.9Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% (95Ã¢â‚¬Â¯% CIÃ¢â‚¬Â¯=Ã¢â‚¬Â¯25.7-28.2Ã¢â‚¬Â¯%). ""Impaired motor skills"", ""Trouble relaxing"" and ""Uncontrollable worry"" were the central symptoms in the whole depression-anxiety network. ""Irritability"", ""Feeling afraid"" and ""Sad mood"" were the most key bridge symptoms linking depression and anxiety. Three symptoms (""Fatigue"", ""Trouble relaxing"" and ""Nervousness"") were the most strongly and negatively associated with QOL. Neither gender nor the experiences of caring for COVID-19 patients was associated with network global strength, distribution of edge weights or individual edge weights. The causality between variables could not be established. Depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed by self-report measures, which may result in recall bias and limitations in capturing clinical phenomena. Both central (i.e., ""Motor"", ""Trouble relaxing"" and ""Uncontrollable worry"") and bridge symptoms (i.e., ""Irritability"", ""Feeling afraid"" and ""Sad mood"") identified in this network analysis should be targeted in specific treatment and preventive measures for comorbid depressive and anxiety symptoms among clinicians in the late stage of the pandemic.

"Navigating Opioid Agonist Therapy among Young People who use Illicit Opioids in Vancouver, Canada","Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) has been shown to reduce opioid use and related harms. However, many young people are not accessing OAT. This study sought to explore how young people navigated OAT over time, including periods of engagement, disengagement, and avoidance. Semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted between January 2018 and August 2020 with 56 young people in Vancouver, Canada who reported illicit, intensive heroin and/or fentanyl use. Following the verbatim transcription of longitudinal interviews, an iterative thematic analysis was used to extrapolate key themes. Young people contemplating OAT expressed fears about its addictiveness. Many experienced pressure from providers and family members to initiate buprenorphine-naloxone, despite a desire to explore other treatment options such as methadone. Once young people initiated OAT, staying on it was difficult and complicated by daily witnessed dosing requirements and strict rules around repeated missed doses, especially for those receiving methadone. Most young people envisioned tapering off OAT in the not-too-distant future. Findings underscore the importance of working collaboratively with young people to develop treatment plans and timelines, and suggest that OAT engagement and retention among young people could be improved by expanding access to the full range of OAT; updating clinical guidelines to improve access to safer prescription alternatives to the increasingly poisonous, unregulated drug supply; addressing treatment gaps arising from missed doses and take-home dosing; and providing a clear pathway to OAT tapering.","Pilarinos, Kwa, Joe, Thulien, Buxton, DeBeck, Fast","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2022.103773","20220703","COVID-19 pandemic; Opioid agonist therapy; opioid use disorder; overdose; young people","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33834,""
"Trajectories of Neurologic Recovery 12 Months After Hospitalization for COVID-19: A Prospective Longitudinal Study","Little is known about trajectories of recovery 12 months after hospitalization for severe COVID-19. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients with and without neurologic complications during index hospitalization for COVID-19 from March 10, 2020, to May 20, 2020. Phone follow-up batteries were performed at 6 and 12 months after COVID-19 onset. The primary 12-month outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score comparing patients with or without neurologic complications using multivariable ordinal analysis. Secondary outcomes included activities of daily living (Barthel Index), telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (t-MoCA), and Quality of Life in Neurologic Disorders (Neuro-QoL) batteries for anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep. Changes in outcome scores from 6 to 12 months were compared using nonparametric paired-samples sign test. Twelve-month follow-up was completed in 242 patients (median age 65 years, 64% male, 34% intubated during hospitalization) and 174 completed both 6- and 12-month follow-up. At 12 months, 197/227 (87%) had Ã¢â€°Â¥1 abnormal metric: mRS &gt;0 (75%), Barthel Index &lt;100 (64%), t-MoCA Ã¢â€°Â¤18 (50%), high anxiety (7%), depression (4%), fatigue (9%), or poor sleep (10%). Twelve-month mRS scores did not differ significantly among those with (n = 113) or without (n = 129) neurologic complications during hospitalization after adjusting for age, sex, race, pre-COVID-19 mRS, and intubation status (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.8-2.5), although those with neurologic complications had higher fatigue scores (T score 47 vs 44; <i>p</i> = 0.037). Significant improvements in outcome trajectories from 6 to 12 months were observed in t-MoCA scores (56% improved, median difference 1 point; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and Neuro-QoL anxiety scores (45% improved; <i>p</i> = 0.003). Nonsignificant improvements occurred in fatigue, sleep, and depression scores in 48%, 48%, and 38% of patients, respectively. Barthel Index and mRS scores remained unchanged between 6 and 12 months in &gt;50% of patients. At 12 months after hospitalization for severe COVID-19, 87% of patients had ongoing abnormalities in functional, cognitive, or Neuro-QoL metrics and abnormal cognition persisted in 50% of patients without a history of dementia/cognitive abnormality. Only fatigue severity differed significantly between patients with or without neurologic complications during index hospitalization. However, significant improvements in cognitive (t-MoCA) and anxiety (Neuro-QoL) scores occurred in 56% and 45% of patients, respectively, between 6 and 12 months. These results may not be generalizable to those with mild or moderate COVID-19.","Frontera, Yang, Medicherla, Baskharoun, Bauman, Bell, Bhagat, Bondi, Chervinsky, Dygert, Fuchs, Gratch, Hasanaj, Horng, Huang, Jauregui, Ji, Kahn, Koch, Lin, Liu, Olivera, Rosenthal, Snyder, Stainman, Talmasov, Thomas, Valdes, Zhou, Zhu, Lewis, Lord, Melmed, Meropol, Thawani, Troxel, Yaghi, Balcer, Wisniewski, Galetta","https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000200356","20220705","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2022-07-06","",33835,""
