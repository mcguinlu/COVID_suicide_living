"Responding to rural adversity: a qualitative study of alcohol and other drug service users' experiences of service response to COVID-19 in Western Australia's Southwest","This study reports on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lived experiences of people with substance use problems in accessing services in the Southwest region of Western Australia, and its implications for preparedness in a context of rural adversity. This was a qualitative study informed by the principles of phenomenology. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and subjected to thematic analysis. Twenty-two participants were interviewed. Two main themes were identified: disruption to supportive connections; and bridging the connection gap: local service response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions exacerbated social isolation and mental health issues, and disrupted services and treatment in the Southwest. Our results demonstrate that local alcohol and other drug services in rural areas can successfully respond to crises by assertively and flexibly adapting their service provision.","Coleman, Taran, Cuesta-Briand","https://doi.org/10.1177/10398562211036125","20210908","COVID-19; alcohol and other drugs; lived experience; rural adversity; substances","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17777,""
"Feasibility of an online, mental health-informed lifestyle program for people aged 60+ years during the COVID-19 pandemic","The COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing regulations have disproportionally impacted the health of older adults. Lifestyle interventions targeting physical activity, diet and fostering social connection may help to alleviate the potential negative health consequences. This study aimed to determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering an online group lifestyle intervention for older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adults aged 60+, living in Australia were recruited to a single-arm feasibility study of a 6-week program delivered via a private Facebook group between June-August 2020. Facilitators provided motivation and education on weekly topics including goal setting and reducing sedentary behaviour in the form of Facebook posts and group video calls. Primary outcomes included feasibility and acceptability and secondary outcomes included psychological distress, quality of life (AQoL-6D), functioning, loneliness and physical activity (PA) with assessments conducted at baseline, post-intervention and 4-week follow-up. N=11 participants were recruited and n=10 (91%) completed the post-assessment questionnaires. High acceptability was observed and exploratory analysis from pre-post intervention found evidence of an effect on secondary outcomes. A mental health informed lifestyle program delivered online via Facebook appears feasible and well accepted among older adults and may help to prevent some of the consequences of inactivity and social isolation associated with the pandemic. SO WHAT?: Online lifestyle interventions appear safe and may provide a scalable, cost-effective strategy for protecting the physical and mental health of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.","McKeon, Tiedemann, Sherrington, Teasdale, Mastrogiovanni, Wells, Steel, Rosenbaum","https://doi.org/10.1002/hpja.538","20210908","COVID-19; isolation; lifestyle; mental health; older adults; physical activity","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17778,""
"COVID-19 vaccines and mental distress","The COVID-19 pandemic brought about large increases in mental distress. The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines is expected to significantly reduce health risks, improve economic and social outcomes, with potential benefits to mental health. To examine short-term changes in mental distress following the receipt of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants included 8,003 adults from the address-based sampled, nationally representative Understanding America Study (UAS), surveyed at regular intervals between March 10, 2020, and March 31, 2021 who completed at least two waves of the survey. Respondents answered questions about COVID-19 vaccine status and self-reported mental distress as measured with the four-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4). Fixed-effects regression models were used to identify the change in PHQ-4 scores and categorical indicators of mental distress resulting from the application of the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. People who were vaccinated between December 2020 and March 2021 reported decreased mental distress levels in the surveys conducted after receiving the first dose. The fixed-effects estimates show an average effect of receiving the vaccine equivalent to 4% of the standard deviation of PHQ-4 scores (p-value&lt;0.01), a reduction in 1 percentage point (4% reduction from the baseline level) in the probability of being at least mildly depressed, and of 0.7 percentage points (15% reduction from the baseline level) in the probability of being severely depressed (p-value = 0.06). Getting the first dose of COVID-19 resulted in significant improvements in mental health, beyond improvements already achieved since mental distress peaked in the spring of 2020.","Perez-Arce, Angrisani, Bennett, Darling, Kapteyn, Thomas","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256406","20210908","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17779,""
"The impact of COVID-19 related educational disruption on children and adolescents: An interim data summary and commentary on ten considerations for neuropsychological practice","The coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in educational disruption of historic breadth and duration. The authors describe early studies and interim standardized assessment reports to highlight effects of educational disruption and present critical questions for neuropsychologists. A summary of pre-pandemic and interim literature was compiled, including analyses of national and local assessment data and preliminary studies on academic gains related to remote learning, educational and school services disruption, chronic absenteeism, and child and adolescent mental and physical health during 2020-2021. Ten major themes were identified in the early reports on impacts of educational disruption. Preliminary information indicates prolonged educational disruption has resulted in attenuated learning gains, most remarkably for those already at risk for educational disparities: students of color, students with disabilities, English learners, and students from low-income households. There have also been increased mental and physical health challenges for some youth during the pandemic. Other literature highlights challenges such as diagnosis of learning disabilities, reliance on normative data and development of academic recovery programs. The effects of prolonged educational disruption and psychological stressors on learning and mental health should be considered in the neuropsychological evaluation of children and adolescents, especially marginalized students. Normative data collected prior to the pandemic may be insufficient for interpretation of scores, and evaluation and treatment may be delayed due to backlog and increased demand. Clinical practice considerations are presented.","Colvin, Reesman, Glen","https://doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2021.1970230","20210908","COVID-19; Educational disruption; learning disability; neuropsychological assessment; remote learning; special education","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17780,""
"Children's perspectives and experiences of the COVID-19 pandemic and UK public health measures","The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound impacts on how we live our lives; yet, the implications for children and the effects on children's everyday lives have been relatively underacknowledged. Understanding children's views on COVID-19 and related restrictions on their lives provides an important opportunity to understand how children have responded to the pandemic, including the impacts on their social and emotional well-being. This study explored the experiences and perspectives of children in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions on everyday life. A qualitative study using semistructured online interviews with participatory drawings was undertaken between May and July 2020. Eighteen children from England and Wales, aged 7-11 years, participated in interviews. Themes included children's reflections on (1) COVID-19 as a deadly contagion; (2) fears and sadness and (3) social responsibility and opportunities to respond positively. Young children offer insightful reflections on their experiences during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Children and young people's perspectives must be considered in future public health discourse. This work was informed by conversations with my own three primary school-aged children and the children of friends. A formal Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group was not established due to the speed with which the project was undertaken. Any future research in this area would benefit from formal PPI in the design, methods and questions.","Thompson, Spencer, Curtis","https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13350","20210908","COVID-19; children; public health; qualitative research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17781,""
"Effect of Online 1-Day Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Based Workshops Plus Usual Care vs Usual Care Alone for Postpartum Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial","Postpartum depression (PPD) affects as many as 20% of mothers, yet just 1 in 10 of these women receives evidence-based treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased PPD risk, reduced treatment access, and shifted preferences toward virtual care. To determine whether an online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based workshop added to treatment as usual improves PPD, anxiety, social support, mother-infant relationship quality, and infant temperament more than treatment as usual alone. This randomized clinical trial included 403 women with PPD who were recruited across Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 20 to October 4, 2020). Women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of at least 10 who were 18 years or older and had an infant younger than 12 months were eligible. Women were randomly assigned to receive a live, interactive online 1-day CBT-based workshop delivered by a registered psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or clinical psychology graduate student in addition to treatment as usual (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°202) or to receive treatment as usual and wait-listed to receive the workshop 12 weeks later (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°201). The primary outcome was change in PPD (EPDS scores) in experimental and wait list control groups 12 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes included maternal anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7]), social support (Social Provisions Scale), quality of the mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire), and infant temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form). Participants all identified as women with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (4.4) years. The workshop led to significant mean (SD) reductions in EPDS scores (from 16.47 [4.41] to 11.65 [4.83]; BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-4.82; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and was associated with a higher odds of exhibiting a clinically significant decrease in EPDS scores (odds ratio,Ã¢â‚¬â€°4.15; 95% CI, 2.66-6.46). The mean (SD) GAD-7 scores decreased from 12.41 (5.12) to 7.97 (5.54) after the workshop (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-4.44; 95% CI, -5.47 to -3.38; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001) and participants were more likely to experience a clinically significant change (odds ratio,Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.09; 95% CI, 1.99-4.81). Mothers also reported improvements in bonding (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-3.22; 95% CI, -4.72 to -1.71; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), infant-focused anxiety (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°-1.64; 95% CI, -2.25 to 1.00; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), social support (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.31; 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.57; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001), and positive affectivity/surgency in infants (BÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.31; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56; PÃ¢â‚¬â€°&lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°.001). In this randomized clinical trial, an online 1-day CBT-based workshop for PPD provides an effective, brief option for mothers, reducing PPD and anxiety as well as improving social support, the mother-infant relationship, and positive affectivity/surgency in offspring.

"Predictors of mental health worsening among children and adolescents during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic","Restrictions put in place to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have significantly affected the lives of children and adolescents worldwide. School closure, home confinement and social distancing have the potential to negatively impact the mental health of this population. Several risk factors seem to contribute to worsening mental health of children and adolescents, with an increase of anxiety and depression symptoms. This review aims at exploring research available on risk factors that may worsen the mental health among children and adolescents during the pandemic. Some of these predictors in worsening the effects are social isolation, screen time and excessive social media use, parental stress and poor parent-child relationship, low socioeconomic status, preexisting mental health conditions and/or disabilities. Further research is needed in order to understand mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as risk factors associated with negative consequences. New findings will help in targeting evidence-based interventions to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of children and adolescents.","Caffo, Asta, Scandroglio","https://doi.org/10.1097/YCO.0000000000000747","20210908","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17783,""
"The roles of serotonin in cell adhesion and migration, and cytoskeletal remodeling","Serotonin is well knownÃ‚Â as a neurotransmitter.

"Associations of loneliness, belongingness and health behaviors with psychological distress and wellbeing during COVID-19","The aim of this study was to assess the effects of loneliness, belongingness and other modifiable factors on psychological distress and wellbeing and whether the effects of COVID-19 modulated these relationships. The current study reported on 1217 participants aged 18 years or older who completed an online survey from 28 to 31 March 2020. Survey measures included demographic characteristics; exposure to COVID-19; impact of COVID-19 on employment, finance, and work and social adjustment; loneliness, thwarted belongingness, and health behavior changes as modifiable factors. Outcome measures were psychological distress and wellbeing. Linear regression models revealed that COVID-19 related work and social adjustment difficulties, financial distress, loneliness, thwarted belongingness, eating a less healthy diet poorer sleep and being female were all associated with increased psychological distress and reduced wellbeing (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). Psychological distress was more elevated for those with high difficulties adjusting to COVID-19 and high levels of thwarted belongingness (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.005). Similarly, as COVID-19 related work and social adjustment difficulties increased, wellbeing reduced. This was more pronounced in those who felt lower levels of loneliness (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.0001). Other interactions between COVID-19 impacts were observed with gender and poorer diet for psychological distress and cigarette use, age and gender for wellbeing (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â 0.05). The study was cross-sectional, preventing causal interpretation of the relationships. Modifiable factors, age and gender had significant impacts on psychological distress and wellbeing.

"Therapeutic approaches in covid-19 followed before arrival of any vaccine","In present times covid-19 is spreading and is showing very destructive effects. It does not only affected the physical health but mental health as well as the economy of the major affected countries. <b>C</b>orona viruses are group of related RNA viruses. The first case of this virus was observed in China and then this virus got spread in the many countries and different strategies were made to stop the spread of this virus. Since no particular vaccine was available to cure this so different strategies were made. Due to the emergence of pandemic diseases, drug development and control strategies have been re-examined. One of the most important factors that scientists have to consider is the effectiveness of their drugs. This virus causes the respiratory tract infections which can range from mild to lethal. COVID-19 is a major cause of death in advanced countries. It is due to the absence of any particular vaccine that can effectively treat this condition. So in this review we will discuss about the therapeutic approaches followed to combat this deadly virus. Ayurveda, nitric oxide, nanoparticles and enzymes played a very important role in boosting the immunity and treatment of corona. Many herbs and some tips of using a combination of herbs proved to be very efficient while facing problems in breathing. Giving the dose of nitric oxide at some particular level and chloroquine the drug showed the antiviral activity against the virus. Developing methods to identify and contain COVID-19 is essential to successfully manage the virus. Various strains of the SARS-COV-2 were detected and were found more dangerous. The therapeutic approaches followed actually were efficient and can be used to combat the other variants also. This review focuses on the latest developments in the field of therapeutics and the strategies which were followed before any vaccine.","Sharma, Singh, Singh","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2021.08.265","20210908","MERS (Middle East respiratory disorder Covid); Nitric oxide (NO); SARS-CoV (serious intense respiratory condition Covid)","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17788,""
"COVID-19 Staff Wellbeing Survey: longitudinal survey of psychological well-being among health and social care staff in Northern Ireland during the COVID-19 pandemic","Throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health and social care workers have faced unprecedented professional demands, all of which are likely to have placed considerable strain on their psychological well-being. To measure the national prevalence of mental health symptoms within healthcare staff, and identify individual and organisational predictors of well-being.

At time 2, 84% of respondents had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The survey included four validated psychological well-being questionnaires (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and insomnia), as well as demographic and organisational measures. At time 1 and 2, a high proportion of staff reported moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression (30-36%), anxiety (26-27%), post-traumatic stress (30-32%) and insomnia (27-28%); overall, significance tests and effect size data suggested psychological well-being was generally stable between November 2020 and February 2021 for health and social care staff. Multiple linear regression models indicated that perceptions of less effective communication within their organisation predicted greater levels of anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress and insomnia.

"Effects of the first COVID-19 lockdown on quality and safety in mental healthcare transitions in England","The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid implementation of changes to practice in mental health services, in particular transitions of care. Care transitions pose a particular threat to patient safety. This study aimed to understand the perspectives of different stakeholders about the impact of temporary changes in practice and policy of mental health transitions as a result of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on perceived healthcare quality and safety. Thirty-four participants were interviewed about quality and safety in mental health transitions during May and June 2020 (the end of the first UK national lockdown). Semi-structured remote interviews were conducted to generate in-depth information pertaining to various stakeholders (patients, carers, healthcare professionals and key informants). Results were analysed thematically. The qualitative data highlighted six overarching themes in relation to practice changes: (a) technology-enabled communication; (b) discharge planning and readiness; (c) community support and follow-up; (d) admissions; (e) adapting to new policy and guidelines; (f) health worker safety and well-being. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated some quality and safety concerns such as tensions between teams, reduced support in the community and increased threshold for admissions. Also, several improvement interventions previously recommended in the literature, were implemented locally. The practice of mental health transitions has transformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, affecting quality and safety. National policies concerning mental health transitions should concentrate on converting the mostly local and temporary positive changes into sustainable service quality improvements and applying systematic corrective policies to prevent exacerbations of previous quality and safety concerns.","Tyler, Daker-White, Grundy, Quinlivan, Armitage, Campbell, Panagioti","https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.996","20210908","COVID-19; Inpatient treatment; care transitions; qualitative research; quality and safety","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17790,""

Following the qualitative design, semi-structured interviews were conducted in the EastWest Lake Fangcang Shelter Hospital, Wuhan on March 2020. Data collection and analysis was based on grounded theory. Open coding was adapted and a structured codebook was developed through coding seminars. The themes and subthemes were then confirmed through thematic analysis. The findings were further explained and integrated in a theoretical framework. A total of 10 COVID-19 patients and 13 staff, including doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, and policemen participated in the interviews. They have common needs, as well as their own needs. The perspectives from the staff also did complement for needs of the patients. The mental health needs were generalized into four themes, that is, basic needs, information and communication, emotional needs, and social support, each with several subthemes. In addition, there were some external factors that regulated the internal needs, which were summarized in a theoretical framework.

This cross-sectional study was performed in Brazil and included a total of 595 individuals recruited through social media platforms, personal and professional contacts. Each participant responded to self-completed questionnaire via an online survey between March 29 and May 7, 2020. The characteristics of physical exercise (frequency, intensity, and duration) were collected before and during the pandemic. The subjective state of mood was measured through the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire during the pandemic. A generalized linear model was employed for the analysis. Exercising during the pandemic only promoted protective effects on the subjective mood. An exercise frequency of 3-5 days/week was associated with improved vigor and between 6-7 days/week with improved vigor and total mood when compared to not exercising at all (<i>p</i>Ã‚Â &lt;Ã‚Â .005). A moderate intensity was associated with improved vigor, and a high intensity with improved vigor, total mood, and less fatigue in comparison to low-intensity exercise programs (<i>pÃ‚Â &lt;</i>Ã‚Â 0.05). Maintaining the same duration of exercise sessions during the pandemic was associated with lower scores of depression/anxiety, fatigue and irritability, and improved vigor and total mood, while performing longer sessions with improved vigor when compared to short exercise sessions (<i>pÃ‚Â &lt;</i>Ã‚Â .005). Regular exercising during the pandemic promotes positive changes in the subjective well-being. Our results reinforce the need for adopting and maintaining a physical exercise routine during the COVID-19 pandemic as a protective effect on mental health.","Oliveira, AraÃƒÂºjo, Silva, Linhares, Pereira, Lima, Elsangedy","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eujim.2021.101374","20210908","COVID; Mental health; Mood; Movement behavior; Physical activity; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17792,""
"Perceived barriers to physical activity during the 2nd lockdown in a northeastern state of Brazil","The practice of physical activity has been recommended during the pandemic period of COVID-19 as a way of preventing the worsening of physical and mental health. After the increase in COVID-19 cases in Brazil and the new lockdown decrees, many people have reported that they are unable to engage in physical activity during the lockdown. The present study aimed to investigate the barriers to physical activity in the 2nd lockdown in the state of CearÃƒÂ¡, Northeast Brazil. 1036 (55.6% women) residents of the state of CearÃƒÂ¡, Northeastern Brazil participated in the study. For data collection, a questionnaire was used including sample characterization questions, physical activity, and barriers to physical activity during the 2nd lockdown in the state of CearÃƒÂ¡. This instrument was made available by Google Forms, between March 8th and 19th, 2021. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for data analysis. The three most relevant barriers were: Lack of motivation (7.3%), lack of space at home (5.9%) professional instructions (2.8%). The lack of space at home barrier was associated with age (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.56; CI 95% 1.05-6.02) and living in the capital (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.53; CI 95% 1.26-5.33). The barriers, taking care of children (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°3.75; CI 95% 1.37-10.2) and increased time spent on daily activities (ORÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°2.20; CI 95% 1.02-4.74) were associated with living in the metropolitan region. The lack of motivation, space at home, and professional instruction showed as being limiting factors to physical activity during the lockdown, indicating plans of action aimed at encouraging the practice of physical activity during a pandemic period.","de Souza, Alves, FaÃƒÂ§anha, Torres","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11332-021-00827-7","20210908","Barriers; COVID-19; Physical activity; Public health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17793,""
"Lived experiences of women academics during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan","This study explores the experiences of women academics while combining the challenging job of online teaching and familial responsibilities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan. The aim is to outline the disproportionate effects of COVID-19 on women academics. We employed a qualitative research design and collected data through in-depth qualitative telephonic interviews with thirteen women academics in four public sector universities in Pakistan. The findings show that women academics remained overwhelmed by the workload; lacked support; and endured a tiring struggle to manage their official duties and familial responsibilities. They were stressed and stuck in their children and family care and online teaching and had hardly any time for academic writing. The participants expressed being burned out, depressed, exhausted, angry, and in desperate need of personal time. Since women experienced the lockdown differently than men we suggest that they may be compensated at the time of tenure/promotions.","Ali, Ullah","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajss.2021.03.003","20210908","Academic publishing; COVID-19; Remote learning; Women academics; Work-life balance","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17794,""
"Stigma, guilt and motherhood: Experiences of pregnant women with COVID-19 in Brazil","The COVID-19 pandemic raises health issues worldwide. Infected pregnant women may have negative mental health outcomes, but little is known about their emotional experiences. We aimed to understand the experience of women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, regarding their feelings, their relationships, and the influence of social media. We conducted a qualitative study among 22 women infected with COVID-19 during pregnancy, from a tertiary hospital during the first wave of the pandemic in Brazil (May-August 2020). We applied semi-directed interviews, sociodemographic and health data sheets, and field diaries. We built the sample purposefully. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. We used thematic analysis and discussed data considering the health psychology framework. We created five categories following a timeline perspective, from before infection to the experience after recovering. Pregnant women were resistant to believing the diagnosis. They described a fear of serious symptoms or death, concerns about the fetus, sorrow from being isolated, and worries about stigma. Family relationships were ambiguous, generating either support or tension. The attachment to the health team through telemedicine or support during hospitalization produced a feeling of security. Participants psychologically denied the COVID-19 diagnosis and did not accomplish isolation properly, even upon medical recommendations. The illness may produce a traumatic experience, regardless of mild or severe symptoms, but family/friend support and contact with the health team helped them to cope. We offer important insights for the clinical approach and future research, emphasizing that infected pregnant women require emotional support.","Freitas-Jesus, SÃƒÂ¡nchez, Rodrigues, Faria-SchÃƒÂ¼tzer, Serapilha, Surita","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wombi.2021.08.009","20210908","COVID-19; Family relations; Pandemic; PhysicianÃ¢â‚¬â€œpatient relations; Pregnant women; Qualitative study","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17795,""
"Experiences of renal healthcare practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic: a multi-methods approach","Globally, renal healthcare practitioners provide intensive and protracted support to a highly complex multi-morbid patient population however knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on these practitioners is extremely limited. This study aimed to explore the experiences of COVID-19 with renal healthcare practitioners during the first global lockdown between June 2020 and September 2020. A multi-methods approach was carried out including a quantitative survey and qualitative interviews. This was a multinational study of renal healthcare practitioners from 29 countries. Quantitative: A self-designed survey on COVID-19 experiences and standardised questionnaires (General Health Questionnaire-12; Maslach Burnout Inventory). Descriptive statistics were generated for numerical data. Qualitative: Online semi-structured interviews were conducted. Data was subjected to thematic analysis. Renal healthcare practitioners (nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°251) completed an online survey. Thirteen renal healthcare practitioners took part in semi-structured interviews (12 nurses and 1 dietician). The majority of participants surveyed were female (86.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°%; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°218), nurses (86.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°%; nÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°218) with an average 21.5 (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°11.1) years' experience since professional qualification, and 16.3 years (SDÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°9.3) working in renal healthcare. Survey responses indicated a level of preparedness, training and satisfactory personal protective equipment during the pandemic however approximately 40.3Ã¢â‚¬â€°% experienced fear about attending work, and 49.8Ã¢â‚¬â€°% experienced mental health distress. The highest prevalence of burnout was emotional exhaustion (35.9Ã¢â‚¬â€°%). Three themes emerged from the qualitative analysis highlighting the holistic complexities in managing renal healthcare, a neglected specialist workforce, and the need for appropriate support at work during a pandemic. Results have highlighted the psychological impact, in terms of emotional exhaustion and mental health distress in our sample of renal healthcare practitioners. As the pandemic has continued, it is important to consider the long-term impact on an already stretched workforce including the risk of developing mental health disorders. Future research and interventions are required to understand and improve the provision of psychological support for specialist medical and nursing personnel.","Mc Keaveney, Reid, Carswell, Bonner, de Barbieri, Johnston, Maxwell, O'Riordan, Strini, Walsh, Noble","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12882-021-02500-0","20210908","Burnout; COVID-19; Healthcare Practitioners; Multi-methods; Renal; Well-being","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17796,""

"Cardiopulmonary transplantation","The Registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation reported 108,034 adult recipients of deceased donor heart transplants between January 1992 and June 2018. The 37th annual adult lung transplant report submitted data to the ISHLT TTX Registry on 67,493 adult recipients of deceased donor transplants between January 1, 1992 and June 30, 2018. In recent years more than 5000 heart transplants and approximately 4000 lung transplants have been performed annually across 388 centres worldwide. Heart transplantation is a proven surgical option for selected patients with advanced heart failure refractory to surgical or medical management. Lung transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage lung disease in patients who have failed medical therapy. More than 90% of adult patients presenting for heart transplantation have dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic cardiomyopathy. Anaesthetic principles for heart transplantation comprise full monitoring, including transoesophageal echocardiography, cardiostable anaesthesia and cardiac support with assessment and treatment of pulmonary vascular hypertension. Median survival after cardiac transplantation is 11.9 years. Lung transplantation includes single-lung, double-lung, bilateral sequential single-lung, heartâ€“lung and lobar transplantation. The most common indication, representing more than one-third of all transplant recipients, is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Donor criteria have become more liberal and lung transplants may involve cardiopulmonary bypass. Pre-bypass air trapping can compromise cardiac function. Postoperative ventilation management should be guided by pH, not P aCO2. Thoracic epidural analgesia provides optimal pain relief without respiratory depression. Five-year survival after lung transplantation is approximately 65%.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mpaic.2021.03.005","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-09-09","",17801,""
