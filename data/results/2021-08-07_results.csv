"Learning torus PCA based classification for multiscale RNA backbone structure correction with application to SARS-CoV-2","Reconstructions of structure of biomolecules, for instance via X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM frequently contain clashes of atomic centers. Correction methods are usually based on simulations approximating biophysical chemistry, making them computationally expensive and often not correcting all clashes. We propose a computationally fast data-driven statistical method yielding suites free from within-suite clashes: From such a clash free training data set, devising mode hunting after torus PCA on adaptive cutting average linkage tree clustering (MINTAGE), we learn RNA suite shapes. With classification based on multiscale structure enhancement (CLEAN), for a given clash suite we determine its neighborhood on a mesoscopic scale involving several suites. As corrected suite we propose the Frechet mean on a torus of the largest classes in this neighborhood. We validate CLEAN MINTAGE on a benchmark data set, compare it to a state of the art correction method and apply it, as proof of concept, to two exemplary suites adjacent to helical pieces of the frameshift stimulation element of SARS-CoV-2 which are difficult to reconstruct. In contrast to a recent reconstruction proposing several different structure models, CLEAN MINTAGE unanimously proposes structure corrections within the same clash free class for all suites.","Henrik Wiechers; Benjamin Eltzner; Kanti V.

"COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and frequent hand hygiene practices among taxi drivers and associated factors in urban areas of Ethiopia","Although several studies have been conducted on COVID-19 knowledge, attitude and prevention practices among healthcare workers and the general population, there has not been any study among taxi drivers in Ethiopia, including Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, the lack of which hinders providing evidence-based interventions to this target group. Thus, this study was designed to contribute to proper planning of COVID-19 intervention measures among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 417 taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town during July to August, 2020. The data was collected using a structured questionnaire and an observational checklist. The collected data was checked, coded and entered to EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. The outcome variables of this study were good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor frequent hand hygiene practices towards COVID-19. Bivariate (Crude Odds Ratio [COR]) and multivariable (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]) logistic regression analysis were employed to identify factors significantly associated with good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices among taxi drivers. Significance level of variables was declared at a p &lt; 0.05 from the adjusted analysis. Out of the total 417 taxi drivers, 69.8% [95% CI: 65.2-73.9], 67.6% [95%CI: 63.1-72.2] and 66.4% [95% CI: 62.1-71.0] of the drivers had good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices, respectively. Educational level (AOR = 7.55, 95% CI = 4.55-12.54), place of residence (AOR = 5.41, 95% CI = 1.4-20.08) and attitude towards COVID-19 prevention (AOR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.02-2.74) were factors associated with good knowledge about COVID-19. Further, age of taxi drivers greater than 30 years (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI = 1.76-5.13), educational level of secondary or above (AOR = 3.16, 95% CI = 1.88-5.31), income (AOR = 3.36, 95% CI = 1.48-7.61), and knowledge about COVID-19 (AOR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.21-3.54) were factors associated with positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention. In addition, attitude towards COVID-19 (AOR = 5.5, 95% CI = 3.40-8.88) and educational level (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI = 1.15-2.95) were the factors associated with good frequent hand hygiene practices. We concluded that the rates of good knowledge, positive attitude and good frequent hand hygiene practices were relatively low among taxi drivers in Dessie City and Kombolcha Town. We strongly recommended providing training about COVID-19 prevention measures for taxi drivers that considers age, education status and attitude areas essential to improve their knowledge, attitude and frequent hand hygiene practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19.","Natnael, Adane, Alemnew, Andualem, Hailu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253452","20210806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16874,""
"""The Use of Electroconvulsive Therapy in Neuropsychiatric Complications of COVID-19: A systematic literature review and case report""","This study reports on the use of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) associated with COVID-19. A review of the literature pertaining to the use of ECT in COVID-19 patients with NPS was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE. Search terms included ""Electroconvulsive Therapy"" and ""ECT,"" combined with ""COVID-19"" and ""SARS-COV-2."" Additionally, we present a case in which ECT was used to achieve complete remission in a patient who developed new onset, treatment-resistant depression, psychosis, and catatonia, associated with COVID-19. 67 articles were reviewed with 3 selected for inclusion. These articles detailed 3 case reports of patients with new onset NPS (mania, psychosis and suicidality, and catatonia) that developed in the context of active COVID-19 and were treated successfully with ECT. There is a significant prevalence of new onset NPS, some severe and persistent, in COVID-19 patients. ECT, a broad-spectrum treatment that has been found to be effective in various NPS (independent of etiology), is shown in our case report and others, to be safe and effective for NPS associated with COVID-19. Though we identified only 3 other cases in the literature, we believe that the probable anti-inflammatory mechanism of ECT, its safety and tolerability, and the faster time to symptom remission support the need for more research and increased clinician awareness about this life-saving procedure.","Austgen, Meyers, Gordon, Livingston","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaclp.2021.07.010","20210806","COVID-19; catatonia; electroconvulsive therapy; neuropsychiatric; psychiatric; psychosis","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16875,""
"Monthly Trends in Self-Reported Health Status and Depression by Race/Ethnicity and Socioeconomic Status During the COVID-19 Pandemic, United States, April 2020 - May 2021","Research has shown worsening physical and mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trends in general and mental health inequalities during the pandemic in the US have not been analyzed in detail. Using Census Bureau's nationally representative pooled Household Pulse Survey (HPS) from April 2020 to May 2021 (N=1,144,405), we examined monthly trends and disparities in health status by race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES). Logistic regression models and disparity indices were used to analyze trends and inequalities. During the pandemic, the adjusted odds of fair/poor health were, respectively, 33%, 157%, 398%, 22% higher for non-Hispanic others, adults with &lt;high school education, those with income &lt;$25,000, and renters, compared to non-Hispanic Whites, those with Ã¢â€°Â¥master's degree, those with incomes Ã¢â€°Â¥$200,000, and homeowners. The adjusted odds of serious depression were, respectively, 49%, 130%, 25% higher for adults with &lt;high school education, with income &lt;$25,000, and renters, compared to their higher-SES counterparts. Disparity indices show increasing trends in racial/ethnic and some SES disparities in general and mental health during the pandemic.

"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on postpartum depression among mothers of extreme and early preterm infants","To examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting isolation measures on the risk of postpartum depression (PPD) after preterm birth. This is a cross-sectional study of mothers of extreme and early preterm infants who completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at the standardized 3-6 months follow-up consultation for preterm infants. Mothers assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic (n = 34; from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) were compared with an antecedent control group (n = 108; from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019). A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the relationship between the pandemic and the risk of PPD (EPDS score Ã¢â€°Â¥ 13). The prevalence of depressive symptoms was significantly higher in the COVID-19 study group (26% versus 12%, p = 0.043). The multivariable logistic regression model showed a significant association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of PPD (adjusted OR 3.60, 95% CI 1.06-12.59, p = 0.040). Among mothers of extreme and early preterm infants, the COVID-19 pandemic was independently associated with a higher risk of PPD. This confirms the need for a close and long-term follow-up of maternal psychological health after preterm birth.","Vatcheva, Mostaert, Van Ingelgem, Henrion, Legros","https://doi.org/10.1002/ijgo.13859","20210806","COVID-19; Depression; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; Pandemic; Postpartum; Preterm birth; Risk factor","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16877,""
"Childcare and depression during the coronavirus pandemic in South Africa: A gendered analysis","The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in the closure of businesses and schools, the remote provision of services and the disruption of the services of professional childminders. These disruptions resulted in a significant increase in parental responsibility for childcare. Such a substantial increase in time requirements for childcare domestically has potential mental health consequences. We therefore ascertained the relationship between childcare and depression in South Africa during the pandemic. Data came from the National Income Dynamics Study-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey, a longitudinal telephonic survey conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. The outcome was a depression index obtained from the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire while the main covariate was the average number of hours spent in taking care of children per weekday. We employed the ordered logit model. We found a positive relationship between spending more hours on childcare and worse depressive health for caregivers in both periods analyzed. Childcare responsibilities preventing/mitigating the ability of caregivers to work as well as preventing caregivers from searching for jobs moderated the depression-childcare relationship. These findings highlight the need to carefully consider policy responses aimed at containing the pandemic. We advocate a multi-stakeholder approach to mitigating the mental health impact of COVID-19 by encouraging more collaboration between government, school authorities, employers and parents/guardians.","Nwosu","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0255183","20210806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16878,""
"Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health: A Mixed-Methods Smartphone-App and Online Survey Study","Behavioral mitigation strategies to slow the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in sweeping lifestyle changes, with short and long term psychological, well-being, and quality of life implications. The Attitudes About COVID-19 and Health (ATTACH) study focuses on understanding attitudes and beliefs whilst considering the impact on mental and physical health and the influence of broader demographic and geographic factors on attitudes, beliefs, and mental health burden. In this assessment of our first wave of data collection, we provide baseline cohort descriptives of ATTACH study participants in the United Kingdom (UK), United States of America (USA), and Mexico. Additionally, we assess responses to daily poll questions related to COVID-19 and conduct a cross-sectional analysis of baseline assessments collected in the UK between June 26 and October 31, 2020. The ATTACH study uses smartphone-app technology and online survey data collection. Participants completed poll questions twice daily related to COVID-19 and a monthly survey assessing mental health, social isolation, physical health, and quality of life. Poll question responses were graphed using 95% Clopper-Pearson (exact) tests with 95% confidence intervals. Pearson correlations, hierarchical linear regression analyses, and generalized linear models assessed relationships, predictors of self-reported outcomes, and group differences, respectively. By October 31, 2020, 1405, 80, and 90 participants had consented to participate in the UK, USA, and Mexico, respectively. Descriptive data for the UK daily poll questions indicated that participants generally followed social distancing measures, but worry and negative impacts on families increased as the pandemic progressed. Although participants generally reported feeling that the reasons for current measures had been made clear, there was low trust that the government was doing everything in its power to meet public needs. In the UK, 1282 participants also completed a monthly survey (95% white, 72% female, 21% key or essential workers). Nineteen percent of UK participants reported a pre-existing mental health disorder, 31% reported a pre-existing chronic medical illness, and 35% were over 65. Fifty-seven percent of participants reported being more sedentary since the pandemic began, and 41% reported reduced access to medical care. Those with poorer mental health outcomes lived in more deprived neighborhoods, in larger households (ps &lt; .05), had more pre-existing mental health disorders and medical conditions, and were younger than 65 years (all ps &lt; .001). Communities who have been exposed to additional harm during the COVID-19 pandemic were experiencing worse mental outcomes. Factors including having a medical condition, or living in a deprived neighborhood or larger household were associated with heightened risk. Future longitudinal studies should investigate the link between COVID-19 exposure, mental health, and sociodemographic and residential characteristics.

"Testing the differential impact of an internet-based mental health intervention on outcomes of wellbeing and psychological distress during COVID-19: an uncontrolled intervention study","During COVID-19, the psychological distress and wellbeing of the general population has been precarious, increasing the need to determine the impact of complementary internet-based psychological interventions on both positive mental health as well as distress states. Psychological distress and mental wellbeing represent distinct dimensions of our mental health and congruent changes in outcomes of distress and wellbeing do not necessarily co-occur within individuals. When testing intervention impact it is therefore important to assess change on both outcomes at the individual-level, rather than solely testing group differences in average scores at the group-level. The current study set out to investigate the differential impact of an internet-based group mental health intervention on outcomes of wellbeing (i.e., wellbeing, life satisfaction, resilience) and indicators of psychological distress (i.e., depression, anxiety and stress). A 5-week mental health intervention was delivered to 90 participants using the Zoom platform during 2020. Impact on outcomes of distress, wellbeing and resilience was assessed at the start and the end of the program, with MANOVA and Reliable Change Indices (RCI) being used to determine program impact at the group- and individual-level respectively. The intervention significantly improved all mental health outcomes measured, (F(6, 83) = 5.60, p &lt; .001; Wilks' ÃŽâ€º = .71; partial ÃŽÂ·2 = .29) showing small to moderate effects sizes on individual outcomes. The largest effect sizes were observed in life satisfaction and overall wellbeing, ÃŽÂ·2 =.22 and .2 respectively. Larger effect sizes were noted for those with problematic mental health scores at baseline. A total of 92% (n=83) of participants demonstrated reliable change in at least one mental health outcome. Differential response patterns using RCI revealed that more than half of the participants showed improvement in both mental wellbeing and psychological distress, almost one third in outcomes of wellbeing only, and almost a quarter in distress only. Results provide evidence for the significant impact of an internet-based mental health intervention during COVID-19 and indicate the importance of assessing dimensions of both wellbeing and distress when determining mental health intervention effectiveness.

"Repetitive saliva-based mass screening as a tool for controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission in nursing homes","Nursing home (NHs) residents and staff have been severely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was to examine the use of weekly saliva RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 detection among NH workers as a strategy to control disease transmission within NHs in Belgium. From 16 November to 27 December 2020, a voluntary an anonymous weekly screening was implemented in a cohort of 50,000 workers across 572 NHs in the Walloon region of Belgium to detect asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 via saliva RT-qPCR testing and using the Diagenode saliva sample collection device. Positive workers were isolated to avoid subsequent infections in residents and other staff. RT-qPCR testing was based on pooled saliva sampling techniques from three workers, followed by individual testing of each positive or inconclusive pool. The majority of NHs (85%) and 55% of their workers participated. Pooling did not affect sensitivity as it only induced a very decrease of sensitivity estimated as 0.33%. Significant decreases in the prevalence (34.4% to 13.4%) and incidence of NHs with either single (13.8% to 2%) or multiple positive workers (3.7% to 0%) were observed over time. In addition, deaths among NH residents and NH worker absences decreased significantly over time. Weekly saliva RT-qPCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated large-scale feasibility and efficacy in disrupting the chain of transmission. Implementation of this testing strategy in NHs could also be extended to other settings with the aim to control viral transmission for maintaining essential activities.

"Confinement During the COVID-19 Pandemic After Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery-Associations Between Emotional Distress, Energy-Dense Foods, and Body Mass Index","To estimate the association of emotional distress with both consumption of energy-dense micronutrient-poor foods (EDF) and body mass index (BMI) and the association between EDF consumption and change in BMI, during COVID-19 pandemic in patients with prior bariatric surgery. This cross-sectional study applied an online structured questionnaire to 75Ã‚Â postoperative bariatric patients during the first Portuguese lockdown. Emotional distress was assessed trough the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and dietary intake was evaluated by Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). Self-reported BMI prior to and at the end of confinement was used to compute BMI change. Pre-surgery BMI was computed from measured height and weight from clinical records. After adjustment for education, sex, time since surgery, pre-surgery BMI, and exercise practice, moderate/severe scores in HADS were significantly positively associated with consumption of EDF (Ã¡ÂºÅ¾ = 0.799; 95% CI: 0.051, 1.546), but not with BMI. Daily EDF consumption significantly increased the odds of maintaining/increasing BMI (OR = 3.34; 95% CI: 1.18, 9.45), instead of decreasing it (reference). Sweets consumption was the only subcategory of EDF significantly positively associated with the odds of a worse outcome in BMI change (OR = 4.01; 95% CI: 1.13, 14.22). Among postoperative bariatric patients, higher reported levels of emotional distress during confinement are associated with increased EDF consumption. Increased EDF consumption during confinement, particularly sweets, is associated with higher odds of bariatric patients not decreasing their BMI. Additional effort is needed to address inadequate lifestyle behaviors among these patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","DurÃƒÂ£o, Vaz, de Oliveira, Calhau","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-021-05608-2","20210806","BMI; COVID-19; Energy-dense foods; HADS scale; bariatric surgery","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16882,""

Adolescents (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°143) completed study measures as part of the standard intake process between March 13th and August 14th, 2020. Participants answered questionnaires assessing COVID-specific passive and active suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behavior, as well as COVID-related stressors and emotions, and public health guidance compliance. Findings highlights that COVID-specific SI is common in high-risk youth. COVID-specific SI was associated with COVID-19-related negative emotions, elevated stress, and decreased public health guidance compliance. Results suggest that COVID-specific suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and risk correlates, should be assessed within high-risk populations to facilitate prevention of risky behavior associated with intentional COVID-19 exposure.","Burke, Bettis, Kudinova, Thomas, Nesi, Erguder, MacPherson, Thompson, Ammerman, Wolff","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-021-01225-3","20210806","Adolescents; COVID-19; Suicidal ideation and behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16883,""
"Sexual Activity in Adolescents and Young Adults through COVID-19 Pandemic","During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been postulated that the sexual life of adolescent and young adults has been impacted in various aspects, potentially affecting their well-being. Our aim is to investigate the potential changes in the sexual activity and relationships of adolescents and young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. In general, a decrease in sexual desire was reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, in both genders. Fewer sexual intercourses and bonding behaviors between partners were associated with loneliness and depressive symptoms. On the contrary, an increase in sexual desire was expressed in a few people, with masturbation to be the most preferable means of satisfaction.

"Impact of Covid-19 on the Visit of Pediatric Patients with Injuries to the Emergency Department in Korea","The total number of pediatric emergency department (PED) visitors has decreased worldwide since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak. We hypothesized that this might also affect the number of PED visits due to injuries. Therefore, we investigated these changes in PED visits after the COVID-19 outbreak through a long-term multicenter observational study. We assessed the changes in the proportion of injured pediatric patients' weekly visits and the trend in the rate changes since the COVID-19 epidemic began by segmented regression analysis. We also evaluated the weekly change in the distribution of detailed diagnostic codes among pediatric patients with injuries before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The proportion of injury-related PED visits increased when COVID-19 was first confirmed in Korea. After the COVID-19 epidemic, the proportion of foreign body ingestions and fracture patients among all pediatric patients with injuries increased significantly every week. The changes in the proportion of injured pediatric patients after the COVID-19 outbreak may have been the result of social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. The risk of pediatric infections decreased but the risk of injury remained. Therefore, parents should take precautions to prevent infectious diseases and be careful to prevent children's injuries at home.","Choi, Bae, Kim, Kim","https://doi.org/10.3390/children8070568","20210806","COVID-19; emergency department utilization; injury; pediatric emergency department","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16885,""
"Dental Students in Germany throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Psychological Assessment and Cross-Sectional Survey","Multiple investigations have reported high psychological distress among students since the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak started. This survey examined the associations between psychological features, and several demographic and social factors among dental students in German universities. Dental students registered in German universities nationwide were asked to join this survey via a self-directed online questionnaire, from July 2020 to January 2021.

"Testing the Multi-Theory Model (MTM) to Predict the Use of New Technology for Social Connectedness in the COVID-19 Pandemic","Loneliness or social isolation, recently described as a ""behavioral epidemic,"" remains a long-standing public health issue, which has worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of technology has been suggested to enhance social connectedness and to decrease the negative health outcomes associated with social isolation. However, till today, no theory-based studies were performed to examine the determinants of technology use. Therefore, the current study aims to test theory-based determinants in explaining the adoption of new technology in a nationally representative sample during the COVID-19 pandemic (<i>n</i> = 382). A psychometrically reliable and valid instrument based on the multi-theory model (MTM) of health behavior change was administered electronically using a cross-sectional study design. A total of 47.1% of the respondents reported high levels of social isolation, and 40.6% did not use any new technology. Among technology users (59.4%), the three initiation constructs participatory dialogue (b = 0.054, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05), behavioral confidence (b = 0.184, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and changes in the physical environment (b= 0.053, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) were significant and accounted for 38.3% of the variance in the initiation of new technologies. Concerning sustenance in technology users, all three constructs emotional transformation (b = 0.115, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), practice for change (b = 0.086, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), and changes in the social environment (b = 0.061, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) were significant and accounted for 42.6% of the variance in maintaining the use of new technology. MTM offers a powerful framework to design health promotion interventions encouraging the use of new technologies to foster greater social connectedness amid the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond it.","Sharma, Batra, Flatt","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070838","20210806","COVID-19; depression; internet; loneliness; m-health; pandemic; smartphones; social connectedness; social isolation; technology","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16887,""
"Longitudinal Change of Mental Health among Active Social Media Users in China during the COVID-19 Outbreak","During the COVID-19 pandemic, every day, updated case numbers and the lasting time of the pandemic became major concerns of people. We collected the online data (28 January to 7 March 2020 during the COVID-19 outbreak) of 16,453 social media users living in mainland China. Computerized machine learning models were developed to estimate their daily scores of the nine dimensions of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90). Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the SCL-90 dimension scores between Wuhan and non-Wuhan residents. Fixed effect models were used to analyze the relation of the estimated SCL-90 scores with the daily reported cumulative case numbers and lasting time of the epidemic among Wuhan and non-Wuhan users. In non-Wuhan users, the estimated scores for all the SCL-90 dimensions significantly increased with the lasting time of the epidemic and the accumulation of cases, except for the interpersonal sensitivity dimension. In Wuhan users, although the estimated scores for all nine SCL-90 dimensions significantly increased with the cumulative case numbers, the magnitude of the changes was generally smaller than that in non-Wuhan users. The mental health of Chinese Weibo users was affected by the daily updated information on case numbers and the lasting time of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Liu, Li, Qiao, Song","https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9070833","20210806","COVID-19; SCL-90; Sina Weibo; computerized machine learning models; longitudinal analysis; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16888,""

"Mental health outcomes among health-care workers in Oman during COVID-19: A cluster analysis","Despite the much heralded epidemic of adjustment difficulties, health-care workers (HCW), who are likely to be at risk and impacted with mental health issues, have received scant attention. This study aimed to determine whether definable profiles exist in a cohort of HCWs associated with demographic and mental health problems. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in Oman. Demographic and mental health data were collected from 8 to 17 April 2020. A total of 1132 participants returned their completed questionnaire. A two-step cluster analysis was used to split the sample into three clusters. Cluster A (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°416) was from HCW in non-frontline roles, and constituted ""low-risk and least-impacted"". Cluster B (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°412) and Cluster C (nÃ‚Â =Ã¢â‚¬â€°304) were from frontline HCW and constituted 'high-risk and moderate-impacted' and 'high-risk and high-impacted' groups, respectively. HCWs in Cluster C reported more depression (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), anxiety (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001), stress (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) and clinical insomnia (PÃ‚Â &lt;Ã¢â‚¬â€°0.001) compared with those in the other clusters. HCWs in Cluster C were at the highest risk for mental health problems during the pandemic. Early psychological interventions targeting this vulnerable group may be beneficial.

"Six-Month Outcomes in Patients Hospitalized with Severe COVID-19","Previous work has demonstrated that patients experience functional decline at 1-3 months post-discharge after COVID-19 hospitalization. To determine whether symptoms persist further or improve over time, we followed patients discharged after hospitalization for severe COVID-19 to characterize their overall health status and their physical and mental health at 6 months post-hospital discharge. Prospective observational cohort study. Patients Ã¢â€°Â¥ 18 years hospitalized for COVID-19 at a single health system, who required at minimum 6 l of supplemental oxygen during admission, had intact baseline functional status, and were discharged alive. Overall health status, physical health, mental health, and dyspnea were assessed with validated surveys: the PROMISÃ‚Â® Global Health-10 and PROMISÃ‚Â® Dyspnea Characteristics instruments. Of 152 patients who completed the 1 month post-discharge survey, 126 (83%) completed the 6-month survey. Median age of 6-month respondents was 62; 40% were female. Ninety-three (74%) patients reported that their health had not returned to baseline at 6 months, and endorsed a mean of 7.1 symptoms. Participants' summary t-scores in both the physical health and mental health domains at 6 months (45.2, standard deviation [SD] 9.8; 47.4, SD 9.8, respectively) remained lower than their baseline (physical health 53.7, SD 9.4; mental health 54.2, SD 8.0; p&lt;0.001). Overall, 79 (63%) patients reported shortness of breath within the prior week (median score 2 out of 10 (interquartile range [IQR] 0-5), vs 42 (33%) pre-COVID-19 infection (0, IQR 0-1)). A total of 11/124 (9%) patients without pre-COVID oxygen requirements still needed oxygen 6 months post-hospital discharge. One hundred and seven (85%) were still experiencing fatigue at 6 months post-discharge. Even 6 months after hospital discharge, the majority of patients report that their health has not returned to normal.

"Folding non-homologous proteins by coupling deep-learning contact maps with I-TASSER assembly simulations","Structure prediction for proteins lacking homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) remains a significant unsolved problem. We developed a protocol, C-I-TASSER, to integrate interresidue contact maps from deep neural-network learning with the cutting-edge I-TASSER fragment assembly simulations. Large-scale benchmark tests showed that C-I-TASSER can fold more than twice the number of non-homologous proteins than the I-TASSER, which does not use contacts. When applied to a folding experiment on 8,266 unsolved Pfam families, C-I-TASSER successfully folded 4,162 domain families, including 504 folds that are not found in the PDB. Furthermore, it created correct folds for 85% of proteins in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, despite the quick mutation rate of the virus and sparse sequence profiles. The results demonstrated the critical importance of coupling whole-genome and metagenome-based evolutionary information with optimal structure assembly simulations for solving the problem of non-homologous protein structure prediction.","Zheng, Zhang, Li, Pearce, Bell, Zhang","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crmeth.2021.100014","20210806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16894,""
"Exploring discussions of health and risk and public sentiment in Massachusetts during COVID-19 pandemic mandate implementation: A Twitter analysis","As policies are adjusted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic according to public health best practices, there is a need to balance the importance of social distancing in preventing viral spread with the strain that these governmental public safety mandates put on public mental health. Thus, there is need for continuous observation of public sentiment and deliberation to inform further adaptation of mandated interventions. In this study, we explore how public response may be reflected in Massachusetts (MA) via social media by specifically exploring temporal patterns in Twitter posts (tweets) regarding sentiment and discussion of topics. We employ interrupted time series centered on (1) Massachusetts State of Emergency declaration (March 10), (2) US State of Emergency declaration (March 13) and (3) Massachusetts public school closure (March 17) to explore changes in tweet sentiment polarity (net negative/positive), expressed anxiety and discussion on risk and health topics on a random subset of all tweets coded within Massachusetts and published from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (nÃ‚Â =Ã‚Â 2.8 million). We find significant differences between tweets published before and after mandate enforcement for Massachusetts State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, decreased polarity and increased anxiety expression), US State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, and increased anxiety expression) and Massachusetts public school closure (increased discussion of risk and decreased polarity). Our work further validates that Twitter data is a reasonable way to monitor public sentiment and discourse within a crisis, especially in conjunction with other observation data.","Thorpe Huerta, Hawkins, Brownstein, Hswen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100851","20210806","COVID-19; Public health; Public policy; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Twitter","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16895,""
"Multiple Mediating Effects of Conflicts With Parents and Self-Esteem on the Relationship Between Economic Status and Depression Among Middle School Students Since COVID-19","This study explores associations between perceived economic status and depression among middle school students during COVID-19 in the context of conflict with parents and self-esteem. Data were collected in South Korea in the fall of 2020. A total of 328 middle school students were included, and a multiple mediator model was employed to examine the multiple mediating effects. Middle schoolers' household economic status was negatively associated with their conflict with parents. Conflict with parents was negatively related to middle school students' self-esteem. Indirect effects of perceived economic status <i>via</i> conflict with parents were significantly associated with depression. The indirect effect of perceived economic status <i>via</i> both conflict with parents and self-esteem was related to depression. Government subsidies should temporarily be expanded to improve households' economic status to potentially improve middle school students' depression and to enhance relationships between children and their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, extra financial support from the government should be focused on poor households with children in order to address family conflict, self-esteem, and depression among middle school students.","Lee, Lim, Allen, Choi","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.712219","20210806","conflicts with parents; depression; economic status; middle school students; multiple mediating effects; self-esteem","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16896,""
"Effects of COVID-19 on Mental Health and Anxiety of Adolescents Aged 13-16 Years: A Comparative Analysis of Longitudinal Data From China","<b>Background:</b> Adolescence is an important stage of psychological development, and the psychological and mental problems of many adults are affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. The aim of this study was to understand the psychological status of this group during the epidemic, and to determine the risk factors leading to psychological stress, as well as protective factors. <b>Methods:</b> An online survey was run on April 2, 2020. The participants were 254 adolescents aged 13-16 years from a junior high school in Jiangsu, China. The results were compared with the pre-epidemic data, which came from the psychological status survey routinely carried out by the school. Mental health variables were assessed via the Mental Health Test that included one validity subscale and eight content subscales. <b>Results:</b> The number of adolescents with poor mental health increased significantly from 12.3 to 24.2%. There was significant increase in learning anxiety (33.7 vs. 56.4%), sensitivity tendency (19.8 vs. 46%), somatic anxiety (13.9 vs. 40.7%) and phobia tendency (4.4 vs. 10.1%). During the epidemic, there were significant differences between adolescents with normal and poor mental health in family structure, personality, relationship with siblings, daily exercise time, and risk of family members coming in contact with COVID-19. Living in stem family, no siblings, and risk of contracting COVID-19 from family members were significant risk factors for teenagers with poor mental health. Risk of contracting COVID-19 from family members was the most influential risk factor for learning anxiety, self-blaming tendency, sensitivity tendency, and somatic anxiety. Exercising for Ã¢â€°Â¥1 h per day was a significant protective factor for poor mental health. <b>Conclusions:</b> During the COVID-19 epidemic, adolescents aged 13-16 years have had psychosocial problems, especially learning anxiety, sensitivity tendency, somatic anxiety, and phobia tendency, as well as risk factors for developing them.

"Gender-Based Analysis of the Psychological Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Healthcare Workers in Spain","<b>Purpose:</b> This study aims to analyze from a gender perspective the psychological distress experienced by the medical workforce during the peak of the pandemic in Spain. <b>Methods:</b> This is a single-center, observational analytic study. The study population comprised all associated health workers of the Cruces University Hospital, invited by email to participate in the survey. It consisted of a form covering demographic data, the general health questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28), and the perceived stress scale (PSS-14). We used multivariant regression analysis to check the effect of gender on the scores.

"Trends in Psychiatric Emergency Department Visits in Northern Israel During the COVID-19 Outbreak","<b>Background:</b> During the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), mandatory quarantines increased social isolation and anxiety, with inevitable consequences on mental health and health seeking behavior. We wished to estimate those trends. <b>Methods:</b> We examined all psychiatric visits to the emergency department (ED) during March, April 2020, compared to identical months in 2018, 2019. We evaluated both number and nature of referrals. <b>Results:</b> Throughout the years, psychiatric referrals comprised about 5% of the total number of ED visits. In March-April 2020, 30% decreases were observed in overall ED visits and in psychiatric referrals in the ED. Compared to 2018-2019, in 2020, the proportions of these diagnoses were higher: anxiety disorders (14.5 vs. 5.4%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), personality disorders (6.7 vs. 3.2%, <i>p</i> = 0.001), psychosis (9.5 vs. 6.7%, <i>p</i> = 0.049), post-traumatic stress disorder (3.2 vs. 1.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.023). Compared to 2018-2019, in 2020, proportions were lower for adjustment disorder (5.8 vs. 8.9%, <i>p</i> = 0.036) and for consultation regarding observation (11.7 vs. 31.6%, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001). Differences were not observed between 2018-2019 and 2020 in the proportions of other diagnoses including suicide and self-harm disorders. Referrals concerning suicide and self-harm in a rural hospital and community clinic were 30% lower in the COVID-19 lockdown than in the same months in 2018, 2019. <b>Conclusion:</b> Psychiatric ED visits decreased by the same proportion as overall visits to the ED, apparently driven by fears of COVID-19. Referrals relating suicidality and self-harm shown nominal decrease, but their proportioned share remained constant.

"Psychosocial Impacts of COVID-19 on Healthcare Workers During the Nationwide Partial Lockdown in Vietnam in April 2020","<b>Background:</b> The psychosocial impact of COVID-19 is greater among healthcare workers (HCWs) than the general population. This study aims to identify psychosocial problems faced by HCWs in Vietnam during the national partial lockdown between 1 and 22 April 2020 and to identify risk factors associated with psychosocial issues among this population. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted in the second week of April 2020 during the national lockdown in Vietnam. Snowball sampling technique was used to recruit participants through web-based surveys. The Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) was used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on HCWs through online surveys. <b>Results:</b> Of the 349 HCWs, we found 22.6% reported psychosocial problems. Most of participants reported having exposure to COVID-19 daily (48.7%). The majority of them also felt that their job put them at risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections (90.3%) and expressed fear of potential infection (85.7%). Despite COVID-19 risks, 95.4% of participants, however, expressed their willingness to continue working at their current health facility. In addition, 94.8% of participants believed if they or their family members had been infected, their agency leaders would have provided them with appropriate medical care. Lastly, HCWs who worked in the internal medicine department who did not take care of COVID-19 patients or expressed fear of becoming infected were more likely to have higher total IES-R scores. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings suggest that the support of healthcare leaders and assurance of care might be helpful in mitigating the psychological effects of COVID-19 among HCWs in Vietnam. These resources should be tailored to HCWs who are working in different areas of health services, including staff who are not working directly with COVID-19 patients.

"Heterogeneous mental health development during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom","The COVID-19 pandemic and the mitigation measures by governments have upended the economic and social lives of many, leading to widespread psychological distress. We explore heterogeneity in trajectories of psychological distress during the pandemic in the United Kingdom and relate this heterogeneity to socio-demographic and health factors. We analyze nine waves of longitudinal, nationally representative survey data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study ([Formula: see text]), covering the period from early 2020 to mid-2021. First, latent class mixture modelling is used to identify trajectories of psychological distress. Second, associations of the trajectories with covariates are tested with multinomial logistic regressions. We find four different trajectories of distress: continuously low, temporarily elevated, repeatedly elevated, and continuously elevated distress. Nearly two fifths of the population experienced severely elevated risks of distress during the pandemic. Long-term distress was highest among younger people, women, people living without a partner, those who had no work or lost income, and those with previous health conditions or COVID-19 symptoms. Given the threat of persistent stress on health, policy measures should be sensitized to the unintended yet far-reaching consequences of non-pharmaceutical interventions.","Ellwardt, PrÃƒÂ¤g","https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-95490-w","20210806","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16901,""
"Perceived anxiety and physical activity behaviour changes during the early stages of COVID-19 restrictions in community-dwelling adults in Canada: a cross-sectional study","The COVID-19 pandemic changed daily routines, including physical activity, which could influence physical and mental health. In our study, we describe physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns in relation to the pandemic and estimate associations between anxiety and physical activity and sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling adults. Cross-sectional study. Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Between April and June 2020, a random sample of 1124 adults (Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years) completed an online questionnaire. The online questionnaire captured current walking, moderate intensity, vigorous intensity and total physical activity and sedentary behaviour (ie, sitting and leisure-based screen time), perceived relative changes in physical activity, sedentary and social behaviours since the pandemic, perceived seriousness and anxiety related to COVID-19, and sociodemographic characteristics. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics, perceived relative change in behaviour and current physical activity and sedentary behaviour were compared between adults with low and high anxiety. Our sample (n=1047) included more females (60.3%) and fewer older adults (19.2%). Most participants (88.4%) considered COVID-19 as extremely or very serious and one-third (32.9%) felt extremely or very anxious. We found no differences (p&gt;0.05) in current physical activity or sedentary behaviour by anxiety level. The largest perceived change in behaviours included social distancing, driving motor vehicles, use of screen-based devices, watching television and interactions with neighbours. We found anxiety-related differences (p&lt;0.05) in perceived changes in various behaviours.

During COVID-19 restrictions, remote spotting (e.g., using a telephone, video call, and/or a social media app) emerged to address physical distancing requirements and reduced access to harm reduction and/or sexually transmitted blood borne infection (STBBI's) prevention services. We explored spotting implementation issues from the perspectives of spotters and spottees. Research assistants with lived/living expertise of drug use used personal networks and word of mouth to recruit PWUD from Ontario and Nova Scotia who provided or used informal spotting. All participants completed a semi-structured, audio-recorded telephone interview about spotting service design, benefits, challenges, and recommendations. Recordings were transcribed and thematic analysis was used. We interviewed 20 individuals between 08/2020-11/2020 who were involved in informal spotting. Spotting was provided on various platforms (e.g., telephone, video calls, and through texts) and locations (e.g. home, car), offered connection and community support, and addressed barriers to the use of supervised consumption sites (e.g., location, stigma, confidentiality, safety, availability, COVID-19 related closures). Spotting calls often began with setting an overdose response plan (i.e., when and who to call). Many participants noted that, due to the criminalization of drug use and fear of arrest, they preferred that roommates/friends/family members be called instead of emergency services in case of an overdose. Both spotters and spottees raised concerns about the timeliness of overdose response, particularly in remote and rural settings. Spotting is a novel addition to, but not replacement for, existing harm reduction services. To optimize overdose/COVID-19/STBBI's prevention services, additional supports (e.g., changes to Good Samaritan Laws) are needed. The criminalization of drug use may limit uptake of formal spotting services.","Perri, Kaminski, Bonn, Kolla, Guta, Bayoumi, Challacombe, Gagnon, Touesnard, McDougall, Strike","https://doi.org/10.1186/s12954-021-00530-3","20210806","COVID-19; Digital; Digital health interventions; Harm reduction; Overdose prevention; Spotting","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16903,""
"A randomised controlled trial of the Nextdoor Kind Challenge: a study protocol","Community interventions are often promoted as a way of reducing loneliness and social isolation in our neighbourhoods. However, those community interventions are rarely examined within rigorous study designs. One strategy that holds the potential to reduce loneliness and can promote health and wellbeing is doing acts of kindness. The current study involves evaluating the impact of kindness acts on loneliness in community-dwelling individuals using an online social networking platform. This study is made up of three randomised controlled trials conducted in three countries. Each randomised controlled trial has two arms (intervention vs waitlist control) and is designed to compare the effectiveness of the KIND challenge, which involves doing at least one act of kindness per week within a four-week period. This study will recruit users of an online community, be randomised online, and will be conducted using online assessments. We will first explore the effects of the intervention on the primary outcome of loneliness, followed by secondary outcomes, social isolation, neighbour relationship quality and contact, mental health symptoms, stress, quality of life, and positive affect. Further, we will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of the KIND Challenge. This study, designed to evaluate the impact of kindness on the community, will be the first large scale randomised control trial conducted across three countries, Australia, UK, and USA. It will examine the potential of community-led interventions to reduce loneliness, improve social isolation, and promote neighbourhood cohesion, health, and wellbeing, which is especially crucial during the COVID-19 public health crisis.

"Comprehensive Workplace Policies and Practices Regarding Employee Opioid Use","The workplace is a key environment to impact employees, families, and communities to prevent further opioid and substance misuse, addiction, and overdose. However, it is often overlooked as an ideal location to launch a prevention intervention or support strategy. Employees in recovery, seeking treatment, and dealing with mental distress require employer support. Supports should consider the diversity of the work force and be culturally appropriate. Several data sources, tools, and other resources exist to aid employers in supporting their employees and addressing the opioid epidemic; a few from the National Safety Council are discussed. As well as suitable strategies to strengthen workplace prevention interventions and treatment access, in light of the opioid epidemic, coronavirus pandemic, and workplace disparities.","Cooper, Bixler","https://doi.org/10.1177/10482911211037905","20210806","opioids; prevention; support; treatment; workplace","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16905,""

"Suicide in England in the COVID-19 pandemic: Early observational data from real time surveillance","Background There have been concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to an increase in suicide. The coronial system in England is not suitable for timely monitoring of suicide because of the delay of several months before inquests are held. Methods We used data from established systems of ""real time surveillance"" (RTS) of suspected suicides, in areas covering a total population of around 13 million, to test the hypothesis that the suicide rate rose after the first national lockdown began in England. Findings The number of suicides in April-October 2020, after the first lockdown began, was 121â€¢3 per month, compared to 125â€¢7 per month in January-March 2020 (-4%; 95% CI-19% to 13%, p = 0â€¢59). Incidence rate ratios did not show a significant rise in individual months after lockdown began and were not raised during the 2-month lockdown period April-May 2020 (IRR: 1â€¢01 [0â€¢81â€“1â€¢25]) or the 5-month period after the easing of lockdown, June-October 2020 (0â€¢94 [0â€¢81â€“1â€¢09]). Comparison of the suicide rates after lockdown began in 2020 for the same months in selected areas in 2019 showed no difference. Interpretation We did not find a rise in suicide rates in England in the months after the first national lockdown began in 2020, despite evidence of greater distress. However, a number of caveats apply. These are early figures and may change. Any effect of the pandemic may vary by population group or geographical area. The use of RTS in this way is new and further development is needed before it can provide full national data. Funding This study was funded by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership (HQIP).The HQIP is led by a consortium of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, the Royal College of Nursing, and National Voices. Its aim is to promote quality improvement in patient outcomes, and in particular, to increase the impact that clinical audit, outcome review programs and registries have on healthcare quality in England and Wales. HQIP holds the contract to commission, manage, and develop the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Program (NCAPOP), comprising around 40 projects covering care provided to people with a wide range of medical, surgical and mental health conditions. The program is funded by NHS England, the Welsh Government and, with some individual projects, other devolved administrations, and crown dependencies.","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lanepe.2021.100110","20210501","","Scopus","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-08-07","",16908,""
