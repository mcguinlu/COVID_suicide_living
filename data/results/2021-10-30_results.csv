"Transferability of Psychological Interventions from Disaster-Exposed Employees to Healthcare Workers Working during the COVID-19 Pandemic","Background: The COVID-19 Pandemic had a significant negative impact on the mental health of healthcare workers. Evidence-based interventions that could be used to mitigate this impact are lacking in the literature. This review aims to evaluate psychological interventions used for employees following previous disasters and assess the transferability of these interventions to a healthcare setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Intervention information from a previously published systematic review of the literature published up to 2015 was extracted, and an additional search of studies published from 2015-2020 was conducted. Studies were assessed for transferability using a checklist derived from the PIET-T process model. Results: Interventions from eighteen studies were assessed for transferability (including three studies identified in an updated literature search). Interventions established as most transferable included resilience training, meditation/mindfulness interventions, and cognitive behavioural therapy. Psychological debriefing was transferable but as it is contrary to current recommendations is not deemed appropriate for adoption. Implications: Several existing interventions have the potential to be utilised within the COVID-19 context/pandemic. More research needs to be undertaken in this area to assess these interventions upon transfer.","Sean Treacy; Shane O Donnell; Blanaid Gavin; Tamara Schloemer; Etain Quigley; Dimitrios Adamis; Fiona Mc Nicholas; John Hayden","https://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.10.28.21265604","20211029","","medRxiv","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19716,""

"The association between insecurity and subjective well-being among youth during the COVID-19 outbreak: A moderated mediation model","Sudden and unpredictable changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have profoundly threatened the psychological well-being and increased insecurity among adolescents worldwide. At a critical developmental stage, the well-being of the youth is more vulnerable to adverse environments. This study constructed a moderated mediation model to explore the buffering factors between insecurity and subjective well-being of the youth during the pandemic. During the COVID-19 outbreak in June 2020, data of 5,503 Chinese youth (15-29 years old) were collected via an online questionnaire. Subjective well-being, insecurity, self-control, and hope were measured, and the moderated mediation model was analyzed. Findings from this study showed that with the mediating effect of self-control, insecurity negatively predicted subjective well-being, and hope moderated the association between insecurity and self-control. Specifically, the link between insecurity and self-control was stronger when hope was low but weaker when hope was high. Since this study was mainly conducted in China, and considering the continuous change of the pandemic on a global scale, it is of great significance to conduct cross-cultural and cross-time studies in the future. The results demonstrate that self-control and hope play important roles in buffering the negative effects of insecurity on the subjective well-being of adolescents and young adults. The findings provide implications for reducing the negative impact of insecurity from a positive psychology perspective and for youth mental health interventions during public health crises.","Wen, Ye, Zuo, Han, Zhu, Ke, He","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.091","20211029","COVID-19; hope; insecurity; subjective well-being; youth","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19718,""
"Comparison of suicide attempts among nationally representative samples of Mexican adolescents 12 months before and after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic","There is serious concern over the increase in mental health problemsÃ‚Â during the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Based on data from two Mexican National Health and Nutrition Surveys conducted in 2018-2019 andÃ‚Â 2020 (n=17,925 and 4,913, respectively), we estimated the prevalence of suicide attempts among adolescents 10-19 years old in the previous year. We constructed a multivariate logistic regressionÃ‚Â model adjusted by sociodemographic characteristics and contextual variables for the Covid-19 pandemic. The prevalence ofÃ‚Â suicide attempts in the previous year was similar in both surveys. We found that women, youth in urban localities and individuals living in households where a family member had lost her/his job as a result of the Covid-19 contingency were more likely to attempt suicide compared to their counterparts. On the other hand, attending classes online proved to be a protective factor (aOR=0.3, 95% CI=0.1, 0.8, p=0.022). The principal limitation of our study concerned the restricted size of our sample for the 2020 survey wave. Population-level policies aimed at providing economic protection and helping youth to return to school would exert a favorable impact on the mental health and suicidal behavior of youths.","Valdez-Santiago, Villalobos, Arenas-Monreal, GonzÃƒÂ¡lez-Forteza, Hermosillo-de-la-Torre, Benjet, Wagner","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.111","20211029","Adolescents; Covid-19; Suicide attempts","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19719,""
"Relationship between Working Stress and Anxiety of Medical Workers in the COVID-19 Situation: A Moderated Mediation Model","The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a lot of working stress to medical workers and has a certain impact on their mental health. Working stress is closely related to the increase in anxiety, but few studies have explored whether their relationship will be affected by positive psychological factors in the special situation. 798 medical workers were investigated online after the outbreak of the COVID-19 (10 February to 1 March 2020) in China. The relevant questionnaires were used to evaluate working stress, anxiety, sense of control, and psychological capital. The moderated mediation model test was performed using the SPSS software and PROCESS macro program. Working stress could directly affect anxiety, and indirectly affect anxiety through sense of control. In addition, psychological capital moderated the direct effect of working stress on anxiety, which is more effective at high level of psychological capital. Psychological capital also moderated the second half of the indirect effect of working stress on anxiety, at low level of psychological capital, sense of control was more effective in predicting anxiety. All the data in this study was collected through online questionnaire. The anxiety response measured in this study cannot be specific to the viral epidemic. Under the COVID-19 epidemic situation, for medical workers, low sense of control and low level of psychological capital may be important risk factors of anxiety caused by working stress. Thus, strengthening the sense of control and psychological capital of medical workers would be helpful to reduce their anxiety and maintain their mental health.","Hou, Hou, Zhang, Liu, Chen","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.072","20211029","COVID-19 epidemic; anxiety; psychological capital; sense of control; working stress","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19720,""
"Stress, coping and silver linings: How depressed perinatal women experienced the COVID-19 pandemic","Research on perinatal mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic has largely focused on data from community samples. This study sought to understand the experiences of pregnant and postpartum women with histories of clinically elevated symptoms of depression. Participants included 60 perinatal women who participated in wellness intervention trials for women with antenatal depression. We used a mixed methods approach, assessing depression, anxiety, stressors and coping behaviors, along with narrative responses to questions regarding COVID-specific effects on mental health. Over three-fourths of the sample indicated a worsening of mental health during the pandemic, with 31.7% of women endorsing clinically elevated depression symptoms and 36.7% screening positive for anxiety. Women reported negative impacts on their emotional wellbeing, especially a resurgence of mental health symptoms. Participants also articulated positive experiences during the pandemic, including an appreciation for increased time with family, especially infants. Women detailed numerous, mostly adaptive, coping strategies they had used to mitigate stress; self-isolation and spending time outdoors were associated with having depression above or below the clinical cut off, respectively. The study had a small sample, and the generalizability of findings may be limited, given that participants were clinical trial completers. Although the pandemic upended many aspects of life for perinatal women and raised mental health concerns, many also reported adaptive means of coping and positive experiences or 'silver linings' related to pandemic restrictions. Some coping strategies that were utilized, including wellness-based behaviors, may have helped to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related stress.","Anderson, Salisbury, Uebelacker, Abrantes, Battle","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.116","20211029","Antenatal depression; mixed methods; pandemic; perinatal mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19721,""
"COVID-19 and Delayed Antenatal Care Impaired Pregnant Women's Quality of Life and Psychological Well-being: What Supports Should be Provided? Evidence from Vietnam","This study explored the associations between different structural and functional supports with the quality of life (QOL) and mental well-being of pregnant women whose antenatal care was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Vietnam. A multi-center cross-sectional study was performed on 868 pregnant women. The pregnant women's quality of life questionnaire (QOL-GRAV), the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the Perinatal Infant Care Social Support (PICSS) instruments were employed. The satisfaction with care from different sources was measured. Multivariate Tobit Regression models were used. Seventy pregnant women (8.1%) reported that their antenatal care was influenced by the COVID-19. In this group, a higher level of satisfaction with the care of parents-in-law and a higher score of emotional support were associated with a better ""Physical and Emotional changes"" domain, while a higher level of appraisal support was related to poorer ""Physical and Emotional changes"" domain. A higher level of satisfaction with relatives' care and a higher score of emotional support were correlated with a better ""Life Satisfaction"" domain. EPDS score was negatively correlated with satisfaction with parents-in-law care and appraisal support. Our study highlighted that intervention programs to improve the QOL and psychological well-being of pregnant women in epidemics such as COVID-19 or other diseases in the future should involve other family members such as parents-in-law and relatives as sources of support. The cross-sectional design was unable to draw causal relationships. Recall bias might occur. The convenient sampling method might limit the generalizability of findings.","Nguyen, Nguyen, Ninh, Nguyen, Nguyen, Dam, Nguyen, Do, Vu, Tran, Latkin, Ho, Ho","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2021.10.102","20211029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19722,""
"Mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women: An equity-focused systematic review","Pregnant and postpartum women face major psychological stressors that put them at higher risk of developing common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety. Yet, their limited access to and uptake of traditional mental health care is inequitable, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile interventions emerged as a potential solution to this discontinued healthcare access, but more knowledge is needed about their effectiveness and impact on health equity. This equity-focused systematic review examined the effectiveness and equity impact of mobile interventions targeting common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women. We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and 3 other databases, from date of database inception and until January 2021, for experimental studies on mobile interventions targeting pregnant and postpartum women. We used pooled and narrative synthesis methods to analyze effectiveness and equity data, critically appraised the methodological rigour of included studies using Cochrane tools, and assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Our search identified 6148 records, of which 18 randomized and non-randomized controlled trials were included. Mobile interventions had a clinically important impact on reducing the occurrence of depression (OR = 0.51 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.64]; absolute risk reduction RD: 7.14% [95% CI 4.92 to 9.36]; p&lt;0.001) and preventing its severity perinatally (MD = -3.07; 95% CI -4.68 to -1.46; p&lt;0.001). Mobile cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) was effective in managing postpartum depression (MD = -6.87; 95% CI -7.92 to -5.82; p&lt;0.001), whereas other support-based interventions had no added benefit. Results on anxiety outcomes and utilization of care were limited. Our equity-focused analyses showed that ethnicity, age, education, and being primiparous were characteristics of influence to the effectiveness of mobile interventions. As the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for virtual mental health care, mobile interventions show promise in preventing and managing common mental disorders among pregnant and postpartum women. Such interventions carry the potential to address health inequity but more rigorous research that examines patients' intersecting social identities is needed.","Saad, Magwood, Aubry, Alkhateeb, Hashmi, Hakim, Ford, Kassam, Tugwell, Pottie","https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0259474","20211029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19723,""
"Factors influencing psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in people aging with HIV","Background Older adults living with HIV may be at increased risk of experiencing distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We took advantage of a cohort study in older adults living with HIV in Canada (+BHN) to study the psychological impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. A longitudinal study was conducted in which participants in the +BHN study who had access to the internet and agreed to be contacted were queried on symptoms of psychological distress and its predictors each week between mid-April and the end of June 2020. Evolution of distress, measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), was modelled using Group Based Trajectory Analysis and logistic regression was used to identify factors predictive of psychological distress in the clinical range. Results The 77 +BHN participants who took part in the current study were mostly men (92%) and on average 57.3 years of age. Over the study period, 32.5% experienced psychological distress in the clinical range at one or more weekly surveys. In the transition between the pre-COVID-19 and the COVID-19 periods, the HADS scores followed 5 distinct trajectories: (i) 39.5 % of the sample, with normal HADS scores in the several months preceding the pandemic, experienced an increase in HADS scores; (ii) 30.6% of the sample had normal pre-pandemic HADS scores, remained stable; and (iii) 29.9%, with pre-pandemic presence of distress, had a decrease in HADS scores. During the first wave of COVID-19, some attenuation in distress was seen over time. Feeling lonely and financial insecurity were associated with distress. Conclusion Presence of psychological distress during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic was not universal among older adults with HIV, with as many as one third of the participants reporting an improvement in mental health. Distress was predicted by loneliness and financial insecurity.","Brouillette, Koski, Scott, Austin-Keiller, Fellows, Mayo","https://doi.org/10.1089/AID.2021.0024","20211029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19724,""
"Psychotropic medication prescribing during the COVID-19 pandemic","This study examined changes in psychotropic medication use associated with the early months of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Using Kaiser Permanente Northern California electronic health records, the authors identified adult patients with fills for psychotropic medications and a non-psychotropic comparator (statins) in the 13Ã¢â‚¬Å weeks before and after the first-known COVID-19-related death in California (March 4, 2020). Generalized estimating equations were used to derive relative risk ratios (RRR) for medication fills compared with the prior year. Analyses were stratified by new and continued fills and patient characteristics. Among 2,405,824 patients, the mean (SD) age was 49.8 (17.9) years; 52.9% were female; 47.9% identified as White; 8.0% and 7.9% had anxiety and depression disorder diagnoses, respectively. Accounting for secular trends, in the 13Ã¢â‚¬Å weeks following March 4, 2020, there were increased fills for trazodone (RRRÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1.03, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1.02, 1.04), decreased fills for benzodiazepines (RRRÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.95, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.94, 0.96) and hypnotics (RRRÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.97, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.96, 0.99), and stable fills for antidepressants (RRRÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 1.00, 95% CIÃ¢â‚¬Å =Ã¢â‚¬Å 0.99, 1.00). Relative rates of new fills decreased across most medication classes and continued fills either remained stable or demonstrated non-clinically significant decreases. Patients aged Ã¢â€°Â¥65Ã¢â‚¬Å years demonstrated decreased fills for most medication classes. In the first 13Ã¢â‚¬Å weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, fills for most psychotropic medications remained constant or showed small changes relative to the previous year. Continued (compared with new) fills accounted for observed increases in some medication classes. Older adults demonstrated decreased fills of most medications.","Hirschtritt, Slama, Sterling, Olfson, Iturralde","https://doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000027664","20211029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19725,""
"Safe in my heart: resting heart rate variability longitudinally predicts emotion regulation, worry and sense of safeness during COVID-19 lockdown","Resting heart rate variability (HRV), a surrogate index of cardiac vagal modulation, is considered a putative biomarker of stress resilience as it reflects the ability to effectively regulate emotions in a changing environment. However, most studies are cross-sectional, precluding longitudinal inferences. The high levels of uncertainty and fear at a global level that characterize the COVID-19 pandemic offer a unique opportunity to explore the utility of HRV measures as longitudinal predictors of stress resilience. The present study examined whether resting measures of HRV prior to the COVID-19 outbreak (i.e., nearly 2 years before; Time 0) could predict emotion regulation strategies and daily affect in healthy adults during the May 2020 lockdown (Time 1). Moreover, we evaluated the association between HRV measures, emotion regulation strategies, subjective perception of COVID-19 risk, and self-reported depressive symptoms at Time 1. Higher resting HRV at Time 0 resulted a significant predictor of a stronger engagement in more functional emotion regulation strategies, as well as of higher daily feelings of safeness and reduced daily worry at Time 1. Moreover, depressive symptoms negatively correlated with HRV and positively correlated with the subjective perception of COVID-19 risk at Time 1. Current data support the view that HRV might not only be a marker but also a precursor of resilience under stressful times.","Makovac, Carnevali, Medina, Sgoifo, Petrocchi, Ottaviani","https://doi.org/10.1080/10253890.2021.1999408","20211029","heart rate variability; reappraisal; resilience; safeness; suppression; worry","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19726,""
"HIV service delivery in the time of COVID-19: focus group discussions with key populations in India","There are limited data on the impact of COVID-19-associated disruptions and novel HIV service delivery strategies among key populations (KPs) in low- and middle-income countries. In March 2020, in response to COVID-19, the Government of India revised HIV service delivery policies to include community antiretroviral therapy (ART) distribution and multi-month dispensing (MMD) of ART for all people living with HIV (PLHIV). To assess the acceptability of these adaptations and impact of the pandemic among KPs, we conducted focus groups in November-December 2020 with purposively sampled men who have sex with men (MSM), female sex workers (FSWs) and transgender women (TGW) in Telangana and Maharashtra. Seven discussions were conducted. Topics included HIV service access, risk behaviours, economic security and feedback to ensure service continuity. Inductive coding identified themes across topics. Forty-four individuals aged 20-49 years participated in discussions (13 MSM; 16 FSW; and 15 TGW). Twenty-four participants self-identified as living with HIV. People not living with HIV reported challenges in accessing HIV antibody testing at hospitals due to travel restrictions and fear of contracting COVID-19. Participants accessed HIV antibody testing using transportation arranged by community-based organizations after lockdowns eased. PLHIV reported uninterrupted ART refills and generally consistent adherence; however, there were experiences of delayed CD4 and HIV RNA testing. Participants shared appreciation for MMD as it saved time, money, and reduced exposure to COVID-19. Participants expressed gratitude for home deliveries which enabled ART access, yet shared concerns about home-based services causing confidentiality breaches with family/neighbours. Participants voiced preferences for community-based service provision due to proximity, convenient hours, and welcoming environments compared to public hospitals. Other requests included support for income, employment, nutrient-rich food and more accessible mental health, HIV, and other health services. COVID-19 restrictions had a greater impact on access to HIV antibody, CD4, and RNA testing services compared to ART access. High acceptance of MMD and community-based services support the continued role of differentiated service delivery models to improve KP access to HIV antibody, CD4, RNA testing services, convenient ART retrieval, and integrated services beyond HIV, which may be critical for survival and wellbeing.","Pollard, Gopinath, Reddy, Kumar, Mugundu, Vasudevan, Srikrishnan, Singh, McFall, Mayer, Mehta, Solomon","https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25800","20211029","COVID-19; DSD; HIV; India; key populations","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19727,""
"Post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression among frontline healthcare staff working during the COVID-19 pandemic","High rates of probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) have been reported for frontline health care staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, rates determined by diagnostic assessment are unknown, as are the onset of symptoms and associated index events. We assessed frontline health care staff with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5. Forty-four percent met criteria for PTSD and 39% met criteria for MDD. Twenty-four percent reported COVID-19 trauma as their index event, with the majority of staff reporting trauma that pre-dated the pandemic. While PTSD was likely to be pre-existing, MDD was more likely to develop during pandemic working. These findings indicate the propensity of health care staff to experience a range of occupational and personal trauma associated with PTSD and the need to assess index trauma when diagnosing psychopathology in order to best understand the needs of this workforce. We found high diagnostic rates of PTSD (44%) and major depression (39%) among frontline healthcare staff working during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although major depression developed during the pandemic, PTSD was more likely to be pre-existing. When assessing pandemic-related psychopathology, it is important to assess the onset and index event related to symptoms. Healthcare workers appear to have high rates of PTSD related to occupational and personal trauma, which warrants specific focus in service planning.","Wild, McKinnon, Wilkins, Browne","https://doi.org/10.1111/bjc.12340","20211029","depression; health care staff; post-traumatic stress disorder","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19728,""
"Bonding With Bot: User Feedback on a Chatbot for Social Isolation","Social isolation has affected people globally during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a major impact on older adult's well-being. Chatbot interventions may be a way to provide support to address loneliness and social isolation in older adults. The aims of the current study were to (1) understand the distribution of a chatbot's net promoter scores, (2) conduct a thematic analysis on qualitative elaborations to the net promoter scores, (3) understand the distribution of net promoter scores per theme, and (4) conduct a single word analysis to understand the frequency of words present in the qualitative feedback. A total of 7,099 adults and older adults consented to participate in a chatbot intervention on reducing social isolation and loneliness. The average net promoter score (NPS) was 8.67 out of 10. Qualitative feedback was provided by 766 (10.79%) participants which amounted to 898 total responses. Most themes were rated as positive (517), followed by neutral (311) and a minor portion as negative (70). The following five themes were found across the qualitative responses: positive outcome (277, 30.8%), user did not address question (262, 29.2%), bonding with the chatbot (240, 26.7%), negative technical aspects (70, 7.8%), and ambiguous outcome (49, 5.5%). Themes with a positive valence were found to be associated with a higher NPS. The word ""help"" and it's variations were found to be the most frequently used words, which is consistent with the thematic analysis. These results show that a chatbot for social isolation and loneliness was perceived positively by most participants. More specifically, users were likely to personify the chatbot (e.g., ""Cause I feel like I have a new friend!"") and perceive positive personality features such as being non-judgmental, caring, and open to listen. A minor portion of the users reported dissatisfaction with chatting with a machine. Implications will be discussed.","Dosovitsky, Bunge","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.735053","20211029","chatbot; mental health; qualitative Ã¢â‚¬â€œ quantitative analysis; social isolation; thematic analysis; user feedback","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19729,""

"Is the Automation of Digital Mental Health Ethical? Applying an Ethical Framework to Chatbots for Cognitive Behaviour Therapy","The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the need for mental health support across the whole spectrum of the population. Where global demand outweighs the supply of mental health services, established interventions such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have been adapted from traditional face-to-face interaction to technology-assisted formats. One such notable development is the emergence of Artificially Intelligent (AI) conversational agents for psychotherapy. Pre-pandemic, these adaptations had demonstrated some positive results; but they also generated debate due to a number of ethical and societal challenges. This article commences with a critical overview of both positive and negative aspects concerning the role of AI-CBT in its present form. Thereafter, an ethical framework is applied with reference to the themes of (1) beneficence, (2) non-maleficence, (3) autonomy, (4) justice, and (5) explicability. These themes are then discussed in terms of practical recommendations for future developments. Although automated versions of therapeutic support may be of appeal during times of global crises, ethical thinking should be at the core of AI-CBT design, in addition to guiding research, policy, and real-world implementation as the world considers post-COVID-19 society.","Vilaza, McCashin","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.689736","20211029","artificial intelligence; cognitive behavioural therapy; conversational agents; ethics; mental health","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19731,""
"A Systematic Evaluation of Mobile Health Applications for the Prevention of Suicidal Behavior or Non-suicidal Self-injury","People with suicidal ideation and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) behavior face numerous barriers to help-seeking, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Mobile health applications (MHA) are discussed as one solution to improve healthcare. However, the commercial app markets are growing unregulated and rapidly, leading to an inscrutable market. This study evaluates the quality, features, functions, and prevention strategies of MHA for people with suicidal ideation and NSSI. An automatic search engine identified MHA for suicidal behavior and NSSI in the European commercial app stores. MHA quality and general characteristics were assessed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). MHA of high quality (top 25%) were examined in detail and checked for consistency with established suicide prevention strategies. Of 10,274 identified apps, 179 MHA met the predefined inclusion criteria. Average MHA quality was moderate (M = 3.56, SD = 0.40<i>)</i>. Most MHA provided emergency contact, but lacked security features. High-quality MHA were broadly consistent with the best-practice guidelines. The search revealed apps containing potentially harmful and triggering content, and no randomized controlled trial of any included MHA was found. Despite a large heterogeneity in the quality of MHA, high-quality MHA for suicidal behavior and NSSI are available in European commercial app stores. However, a lack of a scientific evidence base poses potential threats to users.","Sander, Lemor, Van der Sloot, De Jaegere, BÃƒÂ¼scher, Messner, Baumeister, Terhorst","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.689692","20211029","e-health; mobile health apps; non-suicidal self-injury; prevention; suicidal behavior","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19732,""
"Trends in COVID-19 Publications: Streamlining Research Using NLP and LDA","<b>Background:</b> Research publications related to the novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 are rapidly increasing. However, current online literature hubs, even with artificial intelligence, are limited in identifying the complexity of COVID-19 research topics. We developed a comprehensive Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model with 25 topics using natural language processing (NLP) techniques on PubMedÃ‚Â® research articles about ""COVID."" We propose a novel methodology to develop and visualise temporal trends, and improve existing online literature hubs. Our results for temporal evolution demonstrate interesting trends, for example, the prominence of ""Mental Health"" and ""Socioeconomic Impact"" increased, ""Genome Sequence"" decreased, and ""Epidemiology"" remained relatively constant. Applying our methodology to LitCovid, a literature hub from the National Center for Biotechnology Information, we improved the breadth and depth of research topics by subdividing their pre-existing categories.

"Pre-emptive Innovation Infrastructure for Medical Emergencies: Accelerating Healthcare Innovation in the Wake of a Global Pandemic","Healthcare innovation is impeded by high costs, the need for diverse skillsets, and complex regulatory processes. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed critical gaps in the current framework, especially those lying at the boundary between cutting-edge academic research and industry-scale manufacturing and production. While many resource-rich geographies were equipped with the required expertise to solve challenges posed by the pandemic, mechanisms to unite the appropriate institutions and scale up, fund, and mobilize solutions at a time-scale relevant to the emergency were lacking. We characterize the orthogonal spatial and temporal axes that dictate innovation. Improving on their limitations, we propose a ""pre-emptive innovation infrastructure"" incorporating in-house hospital innovation teams, consortia-based assembly of expertise, and novel funding mechanisms to combat future emergencies. By leveraging the strengths of academic, medical, government, and industrial institutions, this framework could improve ongoing innovation and supercharge the infrastructure for healthcare emergencies.","Ramadi, Srinivasan","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2021.648520","20211029","hackathon; health innovation system; innovation infrastructure; pre-emptive innovation; translational medical research","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19734,""
"Early Warning Signs of a Mental Health Tsunami: A Coordinated Response to Gather Initial Data Insights From Multiple Digital Services Providers","<b>Introduction:</b> The immediate impact of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) on morbidity and mortality has raised the need for accurate and real-time data monitoring and communication. The aim of this study is to document the initial observations from multiple digital services providers during the COVID-19 crisis, especially those related to mental health and well-being. <b>Methods:</b> We used email and social media to announce an urgent call for support. Digital mental health services providers (<i>N</i> = 46), financial services providers (<i>N</i> = 4), and other relevant digital data source providers (<i>N</i> = 3) responded with quantitative and/or qualitative data insights. People with lived experience of distress, as service users/consumers, and carers are included as co-authors. <b>Results:</b> This study provides proof-of-concept of the viability for researchers and private companies to work collaboratively toward a common good. Digital services providers reported a diverse range of mental health concerns. A recurring observation is that demand for digital mental health support has risen, and that the nature of this demand has also changed since COVID-19, with an apparent increased presentation of anxiety and loneliness. <b>Conclusion:</b> Following this study, we will continue to work with providers in more in-depth ways to capture follow-up insights at regular time points. We will also onboard new providers to address data representativeness. Looking ahead, we anticipate the need for a rigorous process to interpret insights from an even wider variety of sources in order to monitor and respond to mental health needs.","Inkster","https://doi.org/10.3389/fdgth.2020.578902","20211029","COVID-19; anxiety; data insights; digital mental health; financial stress; isolation","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19735,""
"No Sex Differences in Psychological Burden and Health Behaviors of Healthcare Workers During the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Orders","<b>Background:</b> Females with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) state-ordered home isolation were associated with higher anxiety and reduced sleep quality than males. Sex differences in psychobehavioral changes during the COVID-19 stay-at home orders among healthcare workers remained unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the sex differences in psychological burden and health behaviors among these persons. <b>Methods:</b> This was a cross-sectional study using online data available in the open Interuniversity Consortium for Political and Social Research (OPENICPSR). Healthcare workers including females and males who transitioned to working from home during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders were included. Sex differences were compared using the chi-square test and Student's <i>t</i>-test. We performed logistic and linear regression analyses to determine the association of females with psychological burden and health behaviors. <b>Results:</b> A total of 537 respondents (425 females and 112 males) were enrolled in our study. Sex differences in age (42.1 Ã‚Â± 12.3 years vs. 46.6 Ã‚Â± 15.7 years, <i>t</i> = -2.821, <i>p</i> = 0.005), occupation (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 41.037, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001), mood change (<i>n</i> = 297, 69.9% vs. <i>n</i> = 61, 54.5%, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 9.482, <i>p</i> = 0.002), bedtime schedule (Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 6.254, <i>p</i> = 0.044) and news consumption (<i>n</i> = 344, 80.9% vs. <i>n</i> = 76, 67.9%, Ãâ€¡<sup>2</sup> = 8.905, <i>p</i> = 0.003) were statistically significant. Logistic regression showed that females was negatively associated with better mood status (OR = 0.586, 95% CI 0.153-2.247, <i>p</i> = 0.436). In addition, linear regression showed that females were not correlated with total sleep time after adjusting for sio-demographics, mental health outcomes and health behaviors (<i>B</i> = 0.038, 95% CI -0.313-0.388, <i>p</i> = 0.833). <b>Conclusion:</b> No sex differences in psychological burden and health behaviors of healthcare workers were found during the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. The COVID-19 state-ordered home isolation may be a potential way to reduce disproportionate effects of COVID-19 pandemic on females and help to minimize sex differences in psychological burden and health behaviors among healthcare workers.","Gu, Liu, Sun, Jiang, Cao, Wu, Ma, Chen, Chen, Zhang, Wang","https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.740064","20211029","COVID-19; health behaviors; healthcare worker; psychological; sex difference; stay-at-home orders","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19736,""

"COVID-19 Outbreak and its Burden on a New Wave of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders","The current outbreak of COVID-19 infection among humans is strongly impacting global physical and mental health. This outbreak can induce or exacerbate some chronic disorders such as functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) due to stress, anxiety, depression, insomnia, denial, anger, and fear. The current focus on the physical aspects of COVID-19 infection may distract public attention from the psychosocial consequences of this outbreak. The mental disorders related to this outbreak may develop and extend FGIDs in the long term. FGIDs have a significant impact on daily activities and quality of life and also cause high economic burdens through direct medical costs and loss of productivity. The purpose of this mini-review was to emphasize the critical state of old and new cases of FGIDs during the COVID-19 outbreak. Published English papers about mental health disorders related to the COVID19 outbreak or before the infectious outbreak, stress, and FGIDs were considered and reviewed.

"The Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic on Searching for Health-Related Information and Cyberchondria on the General Population in Italy","<b>Objectives:</b> The Internet has become one of the most common sources people use to search for health-related information, a behavior rapidly increased during the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The present study aimed to investigate behavioral patterns in the online health-related searches and Cyberchondria (CYB) during the COVID-19 pandemic time, in order to explore socio-demographic and psychopathological factors related to CYB. <b>Methods:</b> During the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy, a cross-sectional online survey collected the main socio-demographic variables and habits related to Internet use of 572 participants. CYB was measured by the Cyberchondria Severity Scale-Short Version and different psychopathological factors were measured by specific questionnaires: the Coronavirus Anxiety Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, the Meta-Cognitions about Health Questionnaire, the Internet Addiction Test, the Maudsley Obsessional-Compulsive Questionnaire-Short Version, the Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale, and the WHO Quality of Life-BREF. Descriptives, non-parametric ANOVAs, and Spearman correlations were performed. <b>Results:</b> In the present sample, the Internet was the main source participants used to search for health-related information and nearly one-third increased this habit during the pandemic. Higher expression of CYB emerged in females, in younger participants, in students, and in those suffering from a physical/psychiatric illness. CYB showed a positive correlation with different phenomenology of anxiety (i.e., anxiety about COVID-19, health anxiety, general anxiety, metacognitive believes about anxiety) and with depression, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and problematic usage of the Internet. Conversely, quality of life and self-esteem showed a negative correlation with CYB. <b>Conclusion:</b> During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of the Internet for health-related information and CYB contribute to the psychological stress affecting individuals and society. Delineating subjects more vulnerable to CYB and associated psychopathological factors will help to elaborate operational indications for prevention and psychological support.","Vismara, Vitella, Biolcati, Ambrosini, Pirola, Dell'Osso, Truzoli","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.754870","20211029","COVID-19; Cyberchondria; digital addiction; health anxiety; mental health; online health searches","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19739,""
"Predictors of Alcohol Consumption Among Younger Adults During the First Phase of the COVID-19 Pandemic","<b>Background:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic may lead to negative mental health effects but the effect on alcohol consumption among younger adults is unclear. We assess predictors of change in alcohol consumption during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic among younger adults. <b>Methods:</b> This cross-sectional internet-based survey was part of an overarching project, the Corona Drug Survey, which was conducted from April 30 to August 4, 2020. Participants of any sex and Ã¢â€°Â¥18 years old were included. The primary outcome measure was change in alcohol consumption during the early COVID-19 pandemic. We implemented an ordinal logistic regression to assess the effect (odds ratio [OR] and 95% confidence interval [CI]) of the following predictors: quarantine restrictions on leaving the residence, number of individuals in the household, problematic alcohol consumption before the pandemic (CAGE [cutting down, annoyance by criticism, guilty feeling, and eye-opener] score), personal concern regarding the pandemic, age, and sex. <b>Results:</b> 3,321 participants with a mean age of 32 (SD: 13) years were included in this study. 70.4% of participants reported less or unchanged alcohol consumption in the recent 4 weeks of the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. A higher number of individuals in the household was associated with a reduced alcohol consumption (OR = 0.869; 95% CI = 0.815-0.927). No quarantine restrictions on leaving the residence (OR = 1.593; 95% CI = 1.397-1.817), a higher age (1.006; 1.001-1.011), and female sex (compared to males: 1.206; 1.062-1.371) were associated with an increase in alcohol consumption. The CAGE score before the pandemic (OR = 0.983; 95% CI = 0.931-1.037) and the pandemic concern (0.927; 0.857-1.003) were not associated with a significant change in alcohol consumption. Celebrations were no longer frequent drinking occasions during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic. The majority of participants (60.9%) did not use alcohol drinking as a coping mechanism to mitigate negative effects of the pandemic. <b>Interpretation:</b> In this cohort of younger adults with fewer celebratory drinking occasions, restrictions on leaving the residence and the number of persons in the household were the strongest predictors of reduced alcohol consumption during the early phase of the pandemic.","Brandt, Evens, Reiche, Marek, Moon, GroÃƒÅ¸, Romanello, Masah, Scicchitano, Gutwinski, Montag, MajiÃ„â€¡, Mick","https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.748158","20211029","COVID-19; alcohol; pandemic; predictor; quarantine; younger adults","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19740,""

"Fear, Anxiety, Stress, and Depression of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Among Patients and Their Healthcare Workers - A Descriptive Study","Disease pandemics are known to cause psychological distress. The ensuing mental health issues are not only restricted to the patients and their relatives/friends but affect the healthcare workers (HCWs) as well. Our study aims to assess these psychological trends during the COVID-19 pandemic between the two most affected population groups, that is, patients and frontline healthcare workers. A survey questionnaire, including scales to assess fear, anxiety, stress, depression - PSS 10, and DASS 21, was distributed and sent to all COVID-19 suspected/confirmed individuals and healthcare workers at a tertiary care center along with a second visit after 14 days of answering the first questionnaire and this continued as follow-up. Data were analyzed with the SPSS version 23 using various tests of significance. In the community, COVID-19 patients in the age group 41-50 with respiratory tract symptoms and those who were home isolated/quarantined experienced a greater tendency of mental health problems. Healthcare workers posted in COVID-19 designated areas of the hospital displayed higher levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The high degree of uncertainty associated with novel pathogens has a profound effect on the psychological state of suspected/confirmed cases as well as healthcare workers.

"Mental health in people with Parkinson's disease during the COVID-19 pandemic: potential for targeted interventions?","The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a myriad of challenges to the social life and care of people with Parkinson's disease (PD), which could potentially worsen mental health problems. We used baseline data of the PRIME-NL study (NÃ¢â‚¬â€°=Ã¢â‚¬â€°844) to examine whether the association between COVID-19 stressors and mental health is disproportionately large in specific subgroups of people with PD and to explore effects of hypothetical reductions in COVID-19 stressors on mental health and quality of life. The mean (SD) age of the study population was 70.3 (7.8) years and 321 (38.0%) were women. The linear regression effect estimate of the association of COVID-19 stressors with mental health was most pronounced in women, highly educated people, people with advanced PD and people prone to distancing or seeking social support. Smaller effect estimates were found in people scoring high on confrontive coping or planful problem solving. The parametric G-formula method was used to calculate the effects of hypothetical interventions on COVID-19 stressors. An intervention reducing stressors with 50% in people with above median MDS-UPDRS-II decreased the Beck Depression Inventory in this group from 14.7 to 10.6, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory from 81.6 to 73.1 and the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire from 35.0 to 24.3.

"Evidence of Stability in Patient-Reported Global Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic","Measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) are collected throughout healthcare systems and used in clinical, economic, and outcomes studies to direct patient-centered care and inform health policy. Studies have demonstrated increases in stressors unique to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, their effect on HRQOL is unknown. Our study aimed to assess the change in self-reported global health during the pandemic for patients receiving care in a large healthcare system compared with 1 year earlier. An observational cross-sectional study of 2 periods was conducted including adult patients who had a healthcare appointment and completed the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global Health (PROMIS GH) as standard care during the COVID-19 pandemic and a year earlier. The effect of time on PROMIS global mental health (GMH) and global physical health (GPH) was evaluated through multiple statistical methods. There were 38Ã¢â‚¬â€°037 patients (mean age 56.1 Ã‚Â± 16.6 years; 61% female; 87% white) who completed the PROMIS GH during the pandemic (August 2020) and 33Ã¢â‚¬â€°080 (age 56.7 Ã‚Â± 16.5 years; 61% female; 86% white) who had completed it 1 year earlier (August 2019). GMH was significantly worse, whereas GPH was similar during the pandemic compared with a year earlier (adjusted estimate [standard error]:Ã‚Â -1.21 (0.08) and 0.11 (0.08) T-score points, respectively). Our study found modest, nonclinically meaningful decreases in GMH and similar GPH during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with a year earlier in patients cared for in a large healthcare system.

"Compassion Fatigue in Laboratory Animal Personnel during the COVIDÃ¢â‚¬â€˜19 Pandemic","Compassion Fatigue (CF) is commonly observed in professions associated with human and animal care. The COVID-19 pandemic compelled laboratory animal research institutions to implement new work practices in order to maintain essential animal care operations. These modifications ranged from shift changes to last-resort measures, such as culling animal colonies, to accommodate reduced staffing. Such changes could cause personnel to experience increased stress, isolation, and helplessness-all of which can increase CF risk. In the current study, 200 persons involved with animal research completed an online survey to gauge whether CF among laboratory animal personnel had increased during the pandemic. The survey examined professional quality of life, self-assessed levels of CF, institutional changes, perceived changes in animal welfare, and institutional measures intended to alleviate CF. A total of 86% of participants had experienced CF at some point in their career, with 41% experiencing a CF event (new or worsening symptoms of CF) during the pandemic. In addition, 90% of participants who reported a CF event also reported subsequent effects on their personal or professional lives. Health, employment, and animal-related stress that arose due to the pandemic were all found to influence CF scores significantly. Although 96% of respondents were considered essential workers, 67% did not feel as valued for their work as other essential personnel. Furthermore, 88% of personnel responsible for the euthanasia of healthy animals who experienced a CF event reported that CF also affected their personal life, professional life, or both, and 78% responded that interventions from internal CF programs or leadership did not help to alleviate symptoms of CF. The COVID-19 pandemic and resultant institutional changes will likely have lasting effects on persons and organizations. By determining and subsequently mitigating sources of CF, we can better assist the laboratory animal community during future crises.","Thurston, Chan, Burlingame, Jones, Lester, Martin","https://doi.org/10.30802/AALAS-JAALAS-21-000030","20211029","","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19746,""
"Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a sample of Italian citizens during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave: a cross-sectional survey","to assess the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a sample of Italian citizens during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave and its association with sociodemographic characteristics, housing conditions, and lifestyles modifications. cross-sectional survey. between 21st April and 7th June 2020, a self-administered online questionnaire aiming at investigating mental well-being and lifestyle habits during the lockdown period was disseminated online. Respondents were recruited through a snowball sampling. PTSD symptoms were assessed using a validated screening tool, the SPAN (Startle, Physiological arousal, Anger, Numbness) questionnaire. the study population is composed of 6,687 participants, of whom 71.5% were females. The mean age of the sample was 48.7 years. Globally, 43.8% of the participants reported symptoms of PTSD, especially females. PTSD prevalence showed a decreasing trend across age groups. The likelihood of PTSD symptoms was higher among those who increased alcohol consumption, decreased physical activity, and experienced restless sleep. a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms emerged from this survey, especially among women and younger subjects. Preventive strategies should be implemented to protect the mental health of the most vulnerable citizens in a period of emergency.","Rousset, Favaro, Giordano, Piccinelli, Senore, Ferrante","https://doi.org/10.19191/EP21.6.094","20211029","COVID-19; mental health; post-traumatic stress disorder; quarantine","PubMed","Undecided","","","","","","","","","","","","","False","False","","","","","False","False","False","","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021-10-30","",19747,""
